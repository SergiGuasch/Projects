# Steps done  

- If it matches with the hot song dataframe no need recomendations.    
- If is not in the dataframe (because the spelling or because is not in the top 100) it returns 5 random recomendations from the top list.  

# Next steps
- Return song recomendations related with the artist from the song matched.
