0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel. The atmosphere was lively and busy and the food was excellent, a good mix of standard tapas and ""fresh today"" dishes. Well priced and worth a visit. "
1,"Had to wait for a table but glad we did. The food was really good, mixture of locals and tourists but nice atmosphere. We has a good selection of tapas including calamari’s, mixed fried fish, iberico ham and beef with foie gras along with tomato bread. Bill for 2 with a beer 4 large glasses of white wine and water plus all the tapas was 58 euros. Good value for great quality food. Give it a try."
2,"We went here on the last night of a 4 night trip to Barcelona and were very disappointed. We arrived early (so we didn't have to queue!)- sat in the back, annoyed the waiter by asking for water (tiniest bottles ever!) and ordered all of our faves- shrimp in garlic (good), tomato bread (average), tortilla (average), ham (good)....overall, I would definitely not go back. Felt super touristy and food was so very average- almost like cafeteria food! We had much better tapas at other places on our trip. Very disappointed for our last meal there. Don't get what all the hype is about!"
3,"Our hotel recommended this restaurant. It was fabulous! Great tapas at a very reasonable price. We were here twice and had different items each time. All were excellent! Nice atmosphere too. There’s usually a que, but well worth the wait!"
4,"Fantastic meal at Cervecería Catalana. Food was excellent, service good and really cool atmosphere. Great selection of tapas and reasonably priced. Highly recommend."
