0,14-03-2022,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel. The atmosphere was lively and busy and the food was excellent, a good mix of standard tapas and ""fresh today"" dishes. Well priced and worth a visit. "
1,07-03-2022,4.0,"Had to wait for a table but glad we did. The food was really good, mixture of locals and tourists but nice atmosphere. We has a good selection of tapas including calamari’s, mixed fried fish, iberico ham and beef with foie gras along with tomato bread. Bill for 2 with a beer 4 large glasses of white wine and water plus all the tapas was 58 euros. Good value for great quality food. Give it a try."
2,28-02-2022,2.0,"We went here on the last night of a 4 night trip to Barcelona and were very disappointed. We arrived early (so we didn't have to queue!)- sat in the back, annoyed the waiter by asking for water (tiniest bottles ever!) and ordered all of our faves- shrimp in garlic (good), tomato bread (average), tortilla (average), ham (good)....overall, I would definitely not go back. Felt super touristy and food was so very average- almost like cafeteria food! We had much better tapas at other places on our trip. Very disappointed for our last meal there. Don't get what all the hype is about!"
3,21-02-2022,5.0,"Our hotel recommended this restaurant. It was fabulous! Great tapas at a very reasonable price. We were here twice and had different items each time. All were excellent! Nice atmosphere too. There’s usually a que, but well worth the wait!"
4,21-02-2022,5.0,"Fantastic meal at Cervecería Catalana. Food was excellent, service good and really cool atmosphere. Great selection of tapas and reasonably priced. Highly recommend."
5,7-02-2022 ,5.0,"I’d seen the reviews online and had a friend recommendation to try here and I’m glad I did! The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food."
6,29-01-2022 ,5.0,"That’s an excellent place. High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once."
7,25-01-2022 ,5.0,"We found this restaurant by chance and we loved it! Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!"
8,20-01-2022 ,5.0,The Cerveceria Catalana was simply 5 Stars in any category. The Tapas were outstanding. The service was outstanding. And the prices were excellent. We were in Barcelona 2 nights and ate there both nights. We really enjoyed our experience.
9,29-12-2021 ,4.0,"Great ' classic' tapas, almost all dished we ordered were amazing. Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!"
10,27-12-2021 ,5.0,The food in Cerveceria Catalana is delicious and the prices are great. Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.
11,20-12-2021 ,5.0,"Enjoyed all the tapas in this restaurant, everything was good, especially the garlic prawns. We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)"
12,11-12-2021 ,5.0,"I first ‘discovered’ this place during my first visit in 2013. I ate there x 3. 2021, my hotel is a 1 min walk. Still the best!"
13,11-12-2021 ,5.0,"I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended."
14,30-11-2021 ,5.0,I know this restaurant since 2004 when I attended many times until 2006 business in Barcelona and the quality was and still is really high. I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!
15,29-11-2021 ,5.0,An absolute high quality restaurant with the best tapas you will ever eat. All is fresh made. Desserts are super. I w s here it’s my wife and kids and all enjoyed.
16,23-11-2021 ,5.0,"Amazing place, quiet and quick to serve! Amazing tapas and taste! Super friendly staff, ready to help with any queries."
17,19-11-2021 ,4.0,"We liked our lunch we were just not sure what we were getting. Everyone was very nice, service & food were good. We may try it again if I can get hubby to go."
18,17-11-2021 ,5.0,I went there as a recommendation from several sites and other opinions. Great place for tourists with a huge variety in the menu and high quality of food & drinks. It’s a most in Barcelona!
19,13-11-2021 ,2.0,A really long wait... people was clearly not happy working there. They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.
20,27-10-2021 ,5.0,"We visited the restaurant twice during out five day vacation in Barcelona. The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!"
21,15-10-2021 ,1.0,"Two hours waiting, once in, half of the menu unavailable. 4 bottles of wine drank outside and that was not something for the waiters. After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service."
22,10-10-2021 ,5.0,"The tapas were amazing, our waiter was very helpful in suggesting the top recommendations and how many to order. We absolutely loved it"
23,8-10-2021 ,5.0,The variety of dishes were dizzying! All were amazing . The servers are quick but don’t expect much English from them. Every single dish was tasteful and fun. Loved it
24,4-10-2021 ,5.0,"This is always out go-to place, especially for breakfast, in Barcelona and we are never disappointed by the tasty food. Busy, but the service is always nice.One of the landmarks :) 9/10"
25,1-10-2021 ,5.0,"We had a great time when we visited, we had to come back the next day to eat. IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly."
26,28-09-2021 ,1.0,"Unfirendly stuff! We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier. "
27,22-09-2021 ,5.0,"We loved our experience here. The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal. Lots of locals eating there which is always a good sign.First class food, great service and super efficient.Will definitely go back for more!"
28,21-09-2021 ,5.0,This is our second visit in one week to this restaurant Always a queue but not a long wait and well worth itFriendly service especially from Antonio(always smiling) great food and lovely ambience If you are a G&T drinker this is the placeserved at the table out of the bottle in a goldfish bowl sized glassGo you won’t be disappointed Enjoy
29,18-09-2021 ,2.0,This used to be our favorite restaurant in Barcelona. It is a couple of years since our last visit. But this time the food was disapointing. So we Will not come back. Maybe they Got now crew
30,13-09-2021 ,5.0,The quality of the meal was so perfect. The service was so friendly and recommend me something to eat
31,13-09-2021 ,5.0,"We were in Barcelona a couple of years back. Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!"
32,12-09-2021 ,5.0,"Busy, buzzy, you will see the queue and think you should go elsewhere, but it does move fairly quickly. We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent. "
33,8-09-2021 ,4.0,"My first work trip to Barcelona since the pandemic began, I used to always go to Santa Catarina for their razor clams, but they have changed their menu, so I found my way to Cerveseria Catalana. What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent."
34,4-09-2021 ,2.0,"I raved about this restaurant when I first visited in 2016 but it seems the service and food has taken a nosedive. I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants."
35,31-08-2021 ,5.0,"We had lunch here TWICE and from the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed. The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again."
36,28-08-2021 ,4.0,"This place has everything going for it. It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!"
37,24-08-2021 ,1.0,"NEVER NEVER! I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona."
38,18-08-2021 ,5.0,"The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often."
39,14-08-2021 ,5.0,"Our concierge recommended this place to us, and we ate there every day whilst in Barcelona (mainly for lunch).No booking, so be prepared to wait…it was rammed every day, and REALLY rammed at the week end !!We thought the food was Fantastic and represented fantastic value. Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!"
40,12-08-2021 ,5.0,"Just perfect, all tapas were incredible, nothing else to say, gambas, shrimps, calamaris… the waiting time worth it. Enjoy."
41,7-08-2021 ,2.0,Went in for dinner. Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it. Explanation was that they’ve made the meat bigger which explains that there was no salad. Silly and pricey
42,31-07-2021 ,5.0,"Fantastic tapas , very friendly stuff , we have been lucky to have space the first time al quick, the day after i go and have to wait 40 min for a dinner .."
43,25-07-2021 ,5.0,"I have eaten here two or three times during my many stays in Barcelona and I have always been so happy with my choice. They have a decent menu and are always busy, which is an excellent sign."
44,20-07-2021 ,5.0,"Had diner before, still the best place to enjoy tapas. A must do in Barcelona!Always a great selection of food and still great quality!"
45,19-07-2021 ,2.0,"We went there because it was well scored.Honestly, you pay a lot for the atmosphere and decoration but food is normal and you are still hungry after 7-8 different tapas.I don't really understand how this restaurant got 4.5/5.Sorry I will not come back, I will now go to another restaurant to eat the main course (this was the first course to me)."
46,12-07-2021 ,5.0,"I have been coming here since I can remember, I recommend it to anyone who I know will visit Barcelona. The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)"
47,11-07-2021 ,2.0,"I seriously don't know where to start. This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: ""No worries"".One of the dishes said something like ""tacos beef"" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a ""sorry"" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona. "
48,9-07-2021 ,3.0,"Very disappointed.Negativ: -HORRIBLE SERVICE, we had to wait and remind all the time to get water, to get wine, to get bread (that they actually dont even have or serve, just flautos with tomato sauce)-the toilet where they supposed to have changing table for kids they use as storage, such a big restaurant but I couldnt change my little girls diaper. So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers."
49,7-07-2021 ,5.0,"Good food, traditional catalan. Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas."
50,4-07-2021 ,5.0,"Spent a long weekend at a hotel nearby with my seven year old daughter. We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!"
51,27-06-2021 ,1.0,Unbelievable they don't get a reservation which is not new especially bin Barcelona. But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there 
52,20-12-2020 ,5.0,"This is my third visit to Cerveceria Catalana. Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great ""closer"" service experience as well.Until next time...."
53,6-09-2020 ,1.0,"I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me ""no me hablas en ingles"", ""no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español"". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE."
54,9-08-2020 ,4.0,"Definitely a very good cuality of tapas, everything fresh and tasty, however in my opinion a bit overrated. I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/"
55,1-08-2020 ,1.0,"I came along with my sick dog (he can barely walk and less during summer). When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again."
56,25-07-2020 ,5.0,"Extensive selection of tapas/platters, executed as they should be. Good drinks. Can get crowded but hey, that's part of the experience."
57,1-05-2020 ,5.0,"We tried getting in for dinner 3 nights and the 3rd was finally the charm. The hostess was very friendly each time. The tapas were great, as was the sangria."
58,22-04-2020 ,5.0,We were in Barcelona for 6 days and ate here 4 because of the amazing selection of tapas and excellent service. The wine selections were over the top for a tapas restaurants and the the waiter was great about giving tastes before we picked our bottle.
59,18-04-2020 ,4.0,"Great tapas place.It gets very busy each day, plan to make a reservation.If you sit on the bar you have a good view of all the dishes!"
60,17-03-2020 ,5.0,"Location: friendly. Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied."
61,8-03-2020 ,4.0,"Very well located, in one of the best and elegant parts of central BCN, this is a popular hangout for both locals and tourists, serving very nice and good quality food.The atmosphere is modern and upmarket, designed with a nice combination of colours and light.The place is quite big and can get noisy and busy. Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back."
62,7-03-2020 ,5.0,"I respect Anthony Bourdain. I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!"
63,5-03-2020 ,5.0,Just so exciting and fresh and delicious. Can't describe. We ate early which is not the Spanish way but was easier to get a table and not be rushed. Went back three times.
64,5-03-2020 ,5.0,"My husband and I went here to eat dinner after arriving in Barcelona earlier that afternoon at the recommendation of a local. Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!"
65,5-03-2020 ,5.0,"We were recommended this place by our local air bnb host. It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty. "
66,5-03-2020 ,5.0,"Great service, really good value and delicious options for breakfast. It was always so busy in the evening we couldn’t get near the door! Full of locals - always the best recommendation!"
67,3-03-2020 ,5.0,"This place is very popular. Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!"
68,29-02-2020 ,4.0,"We ate 3 meals at this restaurant (2 dinner and 1 lunch). Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com"
69,27-02-2020 ,5.0,"What an amazing tapas experience! There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!"

71,24-02-2020 ,4.0,It is a very nice place . The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour . 
72,24-02-2020 ,5.0,This place has a wonderful variety of “tapas” (small portion that you can select) everything extremely taste and well done. I loved the Octopus and the Bacalao! Just 2 blocks from Casa Bartllo. 
73,24-02-2020 ,5.0,"Beef tenderloin mondeditas, mini burger and vegetable tempura as well as Spanish and artichoke omelette were our favorites"
74,23-02-2020 ,5.0,"Quite a busy place, we waited around half an hour for a table even though it was almost 3pm. But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty."
75,22-02-2020 ,5.0,"Huge selection of delicious, fresh tapas. The restaurant does get busy and may be slightly more expensive than others but the quality was top notch and it was well worth it. Get there early for shorter wait!"
76,21-02-2020 ,5.0,Wow. What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd. 
77,18-02-2020 ,5.0,"This was recommended by a local and it was the best recommendation given for a restaurant. The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!"
78,12-02-2020 ,5.0,"great tapas in Barcelona, with a reasonable price. you can point the raw seafood in front of you for them to cook it for you. The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order."
79,10-02-2020 ,5.0,Great food...we went back a second time for the tenderloin with foie gras...also excellent sangria. You won't be disappointed!
80,10-02-2020 ,5.0,good food and fast service; The menu was easy to interpret and many pictures exist online for choosing for fav tapas
81,6-02-2020 ,1.0,Awful food. Uncleaned shrimp. Non memorable experience. Too many staff bumping into each other. Like a cruise ship buffet (carnival)... look elsewhere for proper tapas. Bad call trip advisor. 
82,1-02-2020 ,4.0,"Great selection of beers and tapas! The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food."
83,30-01-2020 ,1.0,"Never been so disrespected in a venue before. We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE."
84,30-01-2020 ,1.0,"Went there with some friends. From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic."
85,30-01-2020 ,1.0,"Bad treatment, we made a reservation for a groupe of 12 people. And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist...."
86,29-01-2020 ,5.0,"This is one of the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas."
87,28-01-2020 ,5.0,"Unique atmosphere! If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy..."
88,28-01-2020 ,5.0,"We found it to be the best Tapas place in terms of taste and price.recommend the mini burgers, padrones and more"
89,27-01-2020 ,2.0,"What can I say, yes, 2 stars at best. This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard."
90,27-01-2020 ,5.0,Another of my favorite Tapas restaurants in Barcelona is Catalan. Everything I’ve ever had here has been outstanding...every time.Highly Recommend.
91,23-01-2020 ,4.0,"This is very similar (if i am not mistaken it is the exact same) to Vinitus. I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu."
92,22-01-2020 ,4.0,"We sat outside on a busy tuesday afternoon in January. The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball."
93,22-01-2020 ,5.0,This restaurant is a must for any trip to Barcelona . Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .
94,20-01-2020 ,4.0,Food is pretty good but the place is usually packed and the fact there is too many tourists has an impact on pricing and service in general.
95,19-01-2020 ,4.0,Great place to enjoy the widest range of tapas in Barcelona and the lively atmosphere of a typical Spanish bar. Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.
96,14-01-2020 ,5.0,Always full of people...mostly locals but it is quite famous. The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...
97,14-01-2020 ,5.0,"I was there back in October 2018 actually. And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️"
98,12-01-2020 ,4.0,Expensive but terrific. English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place
99,8-01-2020 ,3.0,Tapas was nice. Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert. 
100,7-01-2020 ,5.0,"Tapas was amazing, reasonably priced. Sit at the bar if you can. Special dessert was super tasty, glad we trusted the waiter"
101,6-01-2020 ,5.0,"We had some of the best Tapas in Spain here! It is a long wait, but definitely worth it! The food is delicious! "
102,6-01-2020 ,2.0,"Food was excellent - when and if it got served - service was hectic at best - it was noisy and very crowded, if fact, we left after the first course, since mine got served to someone else - i only had my appetizer. I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste..."
103,6-01-2020 ,5.0,"The food was delicious and the service was great. The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early."
104,6-01-2020 ,5.0,"Fantastic place! 5 of 7 dinners I spent there. Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries."
105,6-01-2020 ,3.0,"Went around 13:45 30 Dec 2019. It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”"
106,5-01-2020 ,5.0,"We absolutely loved this location for tapas y bebidas! There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P"
107,4-01-2020 ,5.0,"My favorite restaurant in Barcelona that I went to three times. Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait."
108,2-01-2020 ,5.0,"Excellent food in a cool atmosphere! Got there around 8:00 and the wait for a table was about 45 minutes. Well worth it! Food was great, solid service and a bustling atmosphere. Highly recommend!!"
109,1-01-2020 ,5.0,"It was a great Spanish food experience, it is alwyaymy favorite restaurant in Barcelona but u need to wait at least one hour a a half each time... anything your order is more than tasty!!"
110,29-12-2019 ,2.0,Food was fine . Could have done with not having my bag stolen from under my feet while sat at an outside table. Waiters not at all surprised so maybe could have warned us or been a little helpful . 
111,29-12-2019 ,4.0,"This is a place worth a try. Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders."
112,27-12-2019 ,2.0,We have tried dinner and lunch. Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.
113,26-12-2019 ,5.0,"Amazed at the excellent service and food- we chose to go for an early lunch so we didn’t have to wait at all. We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat."
114,26-12-2019 ,3.0,"I expected more from this place given the crowd and the reviews. However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)"
115,24-12-2019 ,5.0,"Simply one of the best tapas bar in town, from the service to food and the ambiance. They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience."
116,21-12-2019 ,5.0,All of the dishes were delicious especially the tuna tapas. Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend 
117,20-12-2019 ,5.0,"We had a little wait for the a table but considering how busy the restaurant was I think we were seated quite quickly. We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience."
118,19-12-2019 ,5.0,"We went wednesday night and it was amazing! We tried almost all plates and all were excellent! Also special service. Reccomended for everyboby to go at least once,u will love this place!"
119,17-12-2019 ,4.0,The food is still great - but prices have jumped exponentially in past four years. Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not
120,16-12-2019 ,5.0,"We had seen the reviews and wanted to check Cerveceria Catalana out for ourselves. I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!"
121,16-12-2019 ,4.0,"We loved this restaurant so much that we came back for a second time. We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty."
122,15-12-2019 ,3.0,"Very average food for the 45 minute wait. Even saw the chef behind the bar heat up a plate in the microwave, was a little bit choking"
123,15-12-2019 ,5.0,"This is quite the famous place. Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back."
124,14-12-2019 ,3.0,i think this restaurant is better than we experienced. How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand. 
125,13-12-2019 ,5.0,Food comes out quick depending on what you order and it’s out as it’s ready. I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.
126,10-12-2019 ,4.0,"Went around 9:00 pm, wait wasn’t bad at all. We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try."
127,9-12-2019 ,4.0,A very good tapas place.One of the very best in town. All is fresh and fairly creative. Special mention to the beef and hot foie gras small sandwich. Delicious and a bargain.Best sangria we had in Barcelona. They accept take-out orders.The place to be is at the bar. Takes patience but well with it.Open till 1:30 AM. Go late!
128,9-12-2019 ,5.0,"wow! great service, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. the Sangria is a must!! the food will having you not wanting to leave and wishing you could eat more. Such wonderful flavours from the starters right to the desserts. We will most certainly be returning"
129,9-12-2019 ,5.0,"Here in Barcelona on business and decided to grab a solo dinner and explore the city a bit. Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!"
130,6-12-2019 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a great place to experience good food in a friendly atmosphere. It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good."
131,2-12-2019 ,1.0,"Had lunch at this restaurant because of the rave reviews and location. HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK."
132,1-12-2019 ,5.0,"Best tapas I've ever had. The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place."
133,1-12-2019 ,4.0,Had a fun lunch at the place. Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...
134,28-11-2019 ,5.0,Brave the lines because it is so worth the amazing food. The sirloin steak with foie gras should not be missed.
135,27-11-2019 ,5.0,"Will spend a week in Barcelona and staying at an apartment near Passeig de Gracia. So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great. "
136,26-11-2019 ,4.0,One of the best places in Barcelona to eat the traditional tapas. It's a crowded place but worth the wait.
137,24-11-2019 ,5.0,"This place is amazing for sumptuous and traditional tapas in Barcelona! Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back"
138,21-11-2019 ,5.0,Wait staff is friendly and accommodating. Food is excellent. Be prepared to wait for a table as this place seems to be a local favorite. The Pudding de coco was delicious!
139,17-11-2019 ,5.0,"Got to get to this restaurant if you visit Barcelona - great overall experience! Food is awesome, waiters are friendly and very helpful with the menu and food selections, leave room for their Bread Pudding!! Try the Eggplant Chips and see if you can eat only one order, bet you cannot!"
140,16-11-2019 ,5.0,"This tapas restaurant was recommended by an employee at the hotel who knew we wanted somewhere nearby. Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana"
141,15-11-2019 ,5.0,"Crowded, nice atmosphere with smiling and funny persons wanting to give you a tasteful experience "
142,15-11-2019 ,4.0,"It can depend of which you go in the year, the quality can have a little variation especially the fried once. But I keep returning as I do enjoy this place a lot."
143,15-11-2019 ,4.0,"Recommended by our hotel, this place was crazy busy. You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return."
144,13-11-2019 ,5.0,"I eat breakfast lunch or dinner here at least 3 times a week.Not much more to add . Great staff , food and wine all at great prices"
145,7-11-2019 ,5.0,Great tapas place in a great location. Everything from seafood to tenderloin was well cooked. The staff was very nice and the dishes came in a good tempo. 
146,7-11-2019 ,5.0,"We have lived in Barcelona for 4 years and we love comming here for the food and authentic feel. Yes, more and more turists come by now, but the tapas are absolutely outstanding "
147,6-11-2019 ,5.0,"I ate here twice during my visit. If you are a meat eater, then you MUST get the tenderloin with foie montadito! So, so good! Also, they have daily specials which I'm pretty sure are all delicious."
148,4-11-2019 ,5.0,We arrived early so we only had a 10 minute wait however if you arrive at peak time you might have to wait much longer. This was our favorite dinner spot in Barcelona. The tapas was wonderful. The sangria was just plain dangerously good. The service was great. Our waiters helped us choose Catalan dishes and were very friendly. Highly recommended!

150,2-11-2019 ,5.0,"If you dont mind the wait, one cannot go wrong at Cerveceria Catalana. Moderately priced tapas place with classic and daily selection of tapas. All top notch. Dont think this place as a tourist trap - popular among locals and tourists because of its close proximity to gracia.. "
151,31-10-2019 ,5.0,"We love the tapas and sangria, had a good time! We were here last week for dinner around 6pm and thank God we have avoided the big crowd! The place became so crowded and there was a long que right after 7pm. The service wasn't that bad at all, the waiters were just really busy and it was understandable that they had to speak really fast, rushing in and out alot. "
152,31-10-2019 ,5.0,"Arrive early or be prepared to wait. This amazing Tapas bar serves the most fresh and delicious tapas paired with reasonably priced wines in the city. Stick with the wines between 14-20 euros a bottle. We found these to be superior to the more expensive bottles after a few visits. Try the filet and duck lover it a house speciality. I recommend the grilled cattle fish, shrimp in hot oil, shrimp scallops and cod fish sewer, the egg with fires and ham are not to be missed These are just the beginning. Because they are so busy the food is always incredibly fresh. If you can’t get in for dinner try a later lunch. Couples can enjoy the bard. Great for couples and families. Large groups will have a worth while wait during busy eating hours. They don’t take reservations."
153,31-10-2019 ,4.0,"After a very long wait, 45 mins, sitting on the pavement, we finally got in. Pros- this place has an amazing atmosphere, it’s busy, noisy and chaotic, it’s fun and the food is pretty awesome. The waiters are brilliant, all offering recommendations and food was tasty and very reasonably priced. If you want busy, atmosphere, sitting very close to the table next to you, but great food - this place is it. Cons - they don’t take bookings, WHY, this means there are people everywhere hanging around tables waiting to pounce on a free stool, you can’t even get a drink and wait. It’s ridiculous and causes stress for all. Saw two people at the bar ask people to move away when they were eating. People are sitting on the pavements all around the front of the restaurant. If only this place took bookings they’d avoid this. Seems like a ploy to me, and one that doesn’t really give a good customer service experience. (To add we went on a quiet Wed night during riot times so this was deemed quiet - I dread to think what waiting is like during the busy times of August/July) "
154,31-10-2019 ,5.0,"The best tapas in the Eixample area ! Wide variety and some truly outstanding taste tingling tapas. Always very busy despite both indoor and outdoor seating so be prepared to wait for anything between 30 to 45 minutes. Once seated, the service is very efficient and friendly. We visited this restaurant three time during our two week stay in Barcelona and each time tried different dishes from the menu."
155,31-10-2019 ,4.0,"Just wandered in, as you do. Had some wine and a snack. Sitting outside, even after midnight, was lovely. We ordered the Tapas Octopus and it was so tender, it hit the spot....will drop by during the day"
156,30-10-2019 ,5.0,"So many tapas choices with a variety of smoked meats, vegetables and cheeses. The sangria was fresh and vibrant with the pitcher nest right for four. Wine selections did not disappoint "
157,30-10-2019 ,5.0,Amazing food and atmosphere! Great place for tapas and lots of spaces to sit! Try it whenever you're in Barcelona.
158,29-10-2019 ,1.0,"I would have given this restaurant 3 stars if one of the filipina server was at least nice. I don't know what her problem was but as soon as we entered the restaurant she almost seemed like she was upset at our group! It turns out (thank goodness) she wasn't even our server! But she kept on giving us dagger looks. Our group occupied 2 tables because there was 11 of us. A message to the servers: LOSE THE ATTITUDE! If you think you are too good to be a server, work somewhere else and don't ruin the dining experience of people who go there to eat that pays for your wages! The service that a patron receives is as important as the taste of the food. I for one would not go back to this restaurant because I don't want to ruin my appetite.Going back to the food, it's average. Nothing special and ruined by that server."
159,29-10-2019 ,5.0,"I have been a patron of Cervesería Catalana for over 10 years now, and can honestly say that their tapas are some of the best in Barcelona. Throughout the time we have been visiting, the food is always consistently good quality and service is excellent. Don’t be fooled by their lack of website or online presence... this is one of the slickest and best run restaurants in Barcelona.Before you visit, please note that they do not take reservations - be prepared to wait for a table if you turn up at busy times. If you’ve got flexibility, I’d recommend coming for an early midweek lunch (when the restaurant is quietest).We personally love the whitebait, Spanish omelette, crispy Camembert, and calamari. They also have a fabulous selection of desserts on offer."
160,27-10-2019 ,3.0,"Good choice of tapas, but a more limited selection of drinks, and a feeling from the server that we were just causing her inconvenience!"
161,27-10-2019 ,5.0,"Travelling solo this was my go-to place for dinner each night. I'd sit at the bar (for which I rarely had to wait) and enjoyed banter with the staff and tech patrons, all of whom were happy to give me suggestions. Menu in both Spanish and English made it easy for met o choose my meals and pricing was good value."
162,26-10-2019 ,1.0,"Cevenseria Catalana was a highly recommended tapas style restaurants by different people for my travel to Barcelona. One star is for the food. This is a tourist trap. Not recommended.1) Huge crowds of tourists waiting outside and inside. Crowds to walk in the restaurant, so they can turn over as many tables as possible. 2) Use of words was rude. Staff in white shirt would just tell people waiting to ""everyone, stand by the corner"". Is it the Spanish culture to not use ""please""?3) We ordered 4 dishes and the waiter/server said ""That's enough for now."" literally. We observed tables next to us and he did the same thing. If it is the standard to order just 4 items each time, please explain it in advance rather then telling people it's enough and leave. 4) The same server recommended 3x of everything to the table of 3 next to us. Not sure how honest that recommendation was as the dishes are not that small.5) Servers just brought food to table and left without a word.6) This belongs to the same restaurant group as Vi Ni Tus restaurant nearby, which had similar service standards with much less crowds. They have the exact same menu. Even though Cevenseria Catalana's daily menu was dated, it is exactly the same as Vi Ni Tus's daily special 2 days ago.After the 4 dishes, adjust asked for the check and left. This is one of the worst dining experiences in my life: rude staff, extremely huge crowds and not enough spaces making it hard to walk through the restaurant. Food we had was: eggplant chips with honey, Spanish omelette, German salad and razor clams. The food was fresh and taste good but not worth the rude staff, long wait and uncomfortable environment."
163,24-10-2019 ,5.0,"My 2nd time. It is a MUST visit when you are in BCN! Love all the tapas! Dinner crowd starts as early as 6:30pm. Not difficult to get a table for two. If it is big group, go early to avoid having to wait long for a table. They have kindly arranged for a table of 13 for us to be seated together but limited us to only 90mins of dining. However we kept ordering more tapas & dessert as they were all so yummy. Stayed on for 2hrs."
164,23-10-2019 ,5.0,Best Tapas in Barcelona!!!! Everything what we tried during visit to Barcelona was excellent. We visited this restaurant three times in 5 days!
165,23-10-2019 ,4.0,"Visited this place for tapas dinner today. Crowded but managed to get seats for my wife and I pretty fast by the Indian waiter. The bespectacled trainee who was serving us was diligent and attentive. That cannot be said for Ruel, who didn’t even look at us when passing us our food or answering our questions about the menu. He was however, very attentive to the Japanese lady at the counter the whole time. He spent about 15 minutes chatting with her and trying to impress her with his limited knowledge of Japanese. Perhaps the management should pay more attention to him to ensure that he doesn’t spend too much time talking to the ladies!Would have given 5 stars if not for Ruel. Bad attitude!"
166,21-10-2019 ,5.0,"This restaurant was highly recommended by our tour guide, he said it’s worth the wait.We arrive and register for the waiting list, which the hostess told us is approximately 20mins however we got a table after only waiting for 10mins. Service was fast and food was delightful delicious!!!We had the potato bravas( MUST TRY), the tomato bread( why is it soooo good, it’s just tomato on a bread,but trust me, order this!!), Padro peppers, beef tenderloin with foie gras( omg this is to die for), and prawn tempura. The Sangria was also quite good.And for the dessert, we had bread pudding ( this is heaven, it’s not too sweet just the right amount)"
167,19-10-2019 ,4.0,Our airport transfer driver recommended this place and he was on the money! Food was awesome. We ate there on two separate occasions and thoroughly enjoyed the food and dessert. I withheld one star because on the 2nd visit our waiter was on the rude side.
168,18-10-2019 ,5.0,"We didn't wait and were seated very quick. We ordered an association of tapas. Ones I remember, small fish, steak, squash flowers, wild mushrooms, garlic prawns, of course the menu changes everyday."
169,18-10-2019 ,3.0,"This is a very busy place with long lines all day! The outside seats always full, we were fortunate to get a table for 4 quickly, but were seated next to a closet where dirty dishes were brought thus extremely noisy. Menu options very limited if you do not eat seafood. Service was quick, not overly friendly, but we found this all across the Mediterranean. We were hungry and it filled us up."
170,17-10-2019 ,5.0,We had an amazing experience here and we enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Every thing was yummy and great.
171,16-10-2019 ,5.0,"We walked by two nights in a row and so many people were waiting we were intrigued. We went couple nights later and since they don’t take reservations over the phone or internet we put our name on the list and came back couple hours later - let me just say worth it!! Great tapas , awesome atmosphere , really good Sangria cava which is must try in Spain and the BEST dessert I possibly ever had! We went back another night just to take dessert to go"
172,15-10-2019 ,5.0,"As a group of five grown-ups with two kids in tow, we expected a long wait before getting seated however we were lucky enough to have been given a table right away. The meal was delightful and proof of this were the clean plates at the end of all the eating. Although we don’t have a photo of it, the adults enjoyed pairing the food with a pitcher of Sangria. "
173,14-10-2019 ,5.0,Always my must visit restaurant when in Barcelona. Always a place to enjoy spanish food. Been here maybe 5-6 x in every visit to Barcelona. Always a pleasure toneat good food here
174,14-10-2019 ,5.0,"We had the best tapas dinner of our trip here! Every dish we tried was really good, but their patatas bravas deserve an extra mention... The sangria and house white wine were also great. Notice that even though we dined on a Sunday we had to wait an hour for a table, so don’t come here if you’re in a rush. We just put our names on the list, went for drinks to a nearby restaurant and came back in an hour. The waiting was really worth it! Also, it’s not too noisy although the restaurant is huge.The staff was noticeably busy, but the service was still great. Nothing but good to say about this restaurant. "
175,12-10-2019 ,5.0,"a place where no one including the help is not having a happy time . Tapas and wines are on point. The pace is clean, appetizing and a fun late night evening. A precious secret for late night fare"
176,9-10-2019 ,5.0,"This restaurant is a must visit if you are looking for excellent tapas.The food is to die for, the staff are friendly and efficient and the prices are really good.We visited for my birthday, as I wanted traditional tapas and had read excellent things about this restaurant. We were not disappointed. We had sooo much food, 2 jugs of sangria, deserts and drinks at the end and it came to just over 80 euros. Considering how much we had, we thought this was excellent value.Be prepared to wait to get a table, even when we walked past at lunch time, there was a queue and you can't reserve in advance.Make sure you get there and put your name down in the wait list. Ours was around 45 minutes and we were there at about 830pm.It really is worth the wait and we'll definitely go back next time we're in Barcelona."
177,8-10-2019 ,5.0,"Ate here twice once on saturday and once on monday, both times worth the wait.Everyhing is fresh and the food is just devine!!!"
178,8-10-2019 ,4.0,"First of all food was excellent except for the waiter that was assigned to us, he was very rude first of all he did not introduce himself . As he was taking orders he commented that the padrones peppers are very spicy so I was kind of hesitant at first but I already had this grilled peppers at la boqueria and it wasn’t spicy, second when we ordered foie gras with sirloin he had a big smirk, so I kind a ignore it and thinking maybe he has that facial expression, the most annoying part is when the first order came out it was a wrong order and he insisted I ordered it and he was like, yes Ayou did ordered this. I knew that I pointed it out to him on the menu and I even said the lobster rice. Obviously this dude was not listening and not repeating and confirming orders. It’s all his attitude and ego. So instead of me and him arguing, imagine a waiter arguing with a customer, the Spanish lady took over and took it away. Anyway the whole meal was delicious we have razor clams, lobster rice, cuttle fish cook to perfection and the sirloin and cava wine. Unfortunately nobody assigned to serve us after we have our food except to the Spanish waitress that I have to ask for another copa of rose cava in which I wish to stay for a great desert but we were not offered it was very embarrassing and he was serving the white couple beside us asking if they want deserts. We are no newbie to dining experience and this was the worst service ever."
179,6-10-2019 ,5.0,"We read about this restaurant in one of the blogs. Waited about an hour to get a table. Ordered some tapas including padron peppers, bravas and shrimp. The bread with tomato was so fresh and juicy we ordered a second serving. Excellent sangrias well worth the wait."
180,6-10-2019 ,1.0,"Based on the reviews, we went to this place to see what all the hype was, waited for an hour and 30 mins after we got seated, few dishes was not available on the menu, we ordered few dishes, most of them were cold, and taste less, I would not recommend it to anyone as there is a lot of better places to go in Barcelona "
181,5-10-2019 ,4.0,"We arrived to Barcelona on an overnight flight and went out looking for a small meal. Based on reviews, we checked out this place. We were seated quickly, and the menu looked fantastic. After settling on our tapas selection, the waiter informed us that page 1 was not available until at least noon (doesn’t say this on the menu). No big deal. Ended up ordering some baguette sandwiches instead. The bread was fantastic and it was just enough food for what we were looking for. The sangria is served in half liter or liter carafes to share. This was also quite good. One complaint was that while we ate, someone mopped the floor, knocking into my husbands foot and my chair numerous times... very disruptive in an otherwise pleasant meal. "
182,3-10-2019 ,5.0,This place was recommended by a local & it was the best meal we had here! Excellent food & service with a huge selection of tapas etc! Everything was really good!
183,2-10-2019 ,5.0,"This restaurant is bigger than it looks from the outside. However it is very busy and you will probably have to wait for a table. It is worth the wait as the food is superb, the sangria is excellent, the service is friendly and most of the menu is translated into English. Highly recommended."
184,1-10-2019 ,5.0,Love the food Good service Amazing atmosphere Fresh food Very clean Not expensive Very good for lunch 
185,29-09-2019 ,5.0,どれも外れもなく美味しかったですが、感動レベルではないです正直。ビーフとフォアグラは美味しかったですが、オイリーなので１つで大満足です。It was great opportunity to try their pinchos! Beef and foie is very delicious and other pinchos were also great.Better visit non-peak time otherwise you have to wait on queue for a long time. 
186,28-09-2019 ,5.0,"We were staying in Barcelona a block away from this restaurant, and every time we passed many people were waiting outside. After a couple days we decided to check it out, but the wait at 8pm was way too long. The following day after a trip to Montserrat (not a place known for its food), we stopped by Cataplana around 6:45 and there was only a 20 min wait- and the wait was worth it. The servers (ours were Filipino and spoke English) were pleasant and helpful. We had several wonderful tapas, including garlic shrimp, anchovies and delicious spicy potatoes. The check was pleasingly inexpensive. "
187,28-09-2019 ,5.0,"You want to eat everything from this restaurant and since it is all about tapas you can try so many. I found the waiters to be fast, efficient and very friendly. They also had some great recommendations. All the food we had was very tasty and very well prepared, really happy we tried it. It was a great experience with amazing food, you can't go wrong."
188,27-09-2019 ,5.0,"Benny Malaga thank you för youre suggestions of cervecia catalana for tapas it was a great athmosphere .

192,22-09-2019 ,4.0,"Yes it is touristy, and crowded but for a reason.If you go with a big group just be prepared to wait.About the food, gambas al ajillo, solomillo con foie, huevos rotos, pan con tomate, tortilla española are among my favorites.I went there with my wife and some of our Spanish friends and target all loved it. My wife and I went there just the two of us at lunch time and were able to grab two seats at the bar within 5 minutes which was great, we chatted with the two girls who were waiting on us and they offered a few suggestions and we had great service. So far I have been here about 6 or 7 times and have always enjoyed.We happily recommend!"
193,22-09-2019 ,5.0,"Finding this place before travel to Barcelona we knew there will be a waiting time up to 45 mins.So we went in for a dinner and there was the que and we Are told for just two of us up to half and our waiting time.After a 20 mins. Wait we got a table.İf you sit on the bar that’s fine first come first serve basis.We ordered few different Tapas dishes and nice cold beers and enjoyed everything very much.Especially the gambas, garlic prawns was out of this world, So soft and tasty.That’s why this place is very popular and packed all the time.Never seen a place this busy all the time.Welldone to owners of this place, they created something really good and succesful.We will definitly return.."
194,22-09-2019 ,5.0,"Despite the long line, it was well worth the wait. The waiters/waitresses are all efficient and you can ask for their recommended tapas. Delicious white and red sangrias to go with it. We stayed 5 days and most of our lunch and dinners were in this place, it's addictive. The Filipino staff are all A+++ spoke fluent English and gave excellent service. Excellent maitre'd as well that kept the long line going."
195,22-09-2019 ,5.0,Very good service and fantastic atmosphere. Tapas restaurant is new to me but the staff gave me good advise. People were lining jo outside to get in. Very populær!
196,21-09-2019 ,5.0,"We went early and sat at the bar. The food was divine, we chatted with the people sitting around us, and by the time we left, the restaurant was so packed you could barely walk through it. Highly recommended."

198,20-09-2019 ,5.0,"We are lucky to get a table by arriving early, around 1130am. The food was great, paella served in just d right amount and the price was reasonable. The Filipino staff were very hospitable and offered attentive service."
199,20-09-2019 ,4.0,"I return every time I'm in Barcelona and they have never disappointed med ever. The atmosphere, the food, the location and the staff - everything brilliant :-)The only thing is that you have to be patient! If you haven't booked a table, days in advance, you have to wait for the table."
200,19-09-2019 ,5.0,"Top notch but not expensive. This restaurant was recommended by my hotel concierge. He warned there is often a wait during their busy dinner hours but its worth it! Being solo I actually didn’t wait long to get a seat at the bar, where I could point to the dishes that looked interesting, and could ask my neighbors what they were eating. Their tapas are fabulous! A good thing to know is you can order 1/2 portions and that way, taste more deliciousness! "
201,19-09-2019 ,1.0,"After receiving a kind reply in response to my previous evaluation where they stated that they would put in place a system to reduce the cue, I went tonight with two friends but was told I had to wait 1h30. The problem is that had I known it before I would have then reserved elsewhere . This confirms you cannot trust the place, which is in fact essentially populated by American or Asian tourists. My advice is to forget it."
202,19-09-2019 ,4.0,"Just off Las Ramblas, this was obviously a tourist destination. The only resl drawback was how crowded it was. They refer to it as tapas, but there are many small plates as well. I had a delicious plate of white anchovies. They do offer a number of samll plates to share."
203,18-09-2019 ,5.0,"Food, service & atmosphere excellent especially service by Francis. All great but recommended to try catfish & bread pudding & both exceptional. Went for lunch as mobbed previous evening."
204,18-09-2019 ,4.0,"Excellent & very popular restaurant. Around an hour’s wait for outside table isn’t unusual at peak times, but worth it."
205,17-09-2019 ,4.0,"If you can wait at least 1/2 an hour after arriving...this the place to be. Cheap and good ! I like this place .noisy , aot of people and Good quick service . Everything is tastyand the Sangria is top."
206,16-09-2019 ,3.0,The only thing disappointing about the place is the wait and as they don’t accept reservations it’s just not worth waiting for an hour to get a table My father is 83 you can’t expect an old man to wait for that long.
207,16-09-2019 ,3.0,"A place everyone recommended so we had to try it. The problem is you can’t book a table so you have to go there and wait. We had to wait for 1,5 hours on a Thursday evening around nine which kind of ruined the feeling. The menu is full of good stuff so they can absolutely deliver but I got an industrial feeling of it all. I recommend to be there early if you want to enjoy it properly. The elf next to us watched a movie loudly on her phone which was pretty annoying too... "
208,16-09-2019 ,1.0,The hostess girl is rude and impolite! We were waiting for the free table 20 min and no one allowed us to sit because they had another much better guests to sit..if you have 1 hr time to wait and to except this attitude-you are welcome 
209,15-09-2019 ,5.0,We found this restaurant kind of by accident. The queue was quite long but we thought it must be a good sign if people are queuing for the food!The tapas were so so good. We had mainly seafood tapas and the highlight was the cockles. The most delicious cockles we’ve ever tasted. So delicious that we ordered a second plate. And the next day we came back again for another round of amazing food for lunch. Wish I could eat their food everyday
210,14-09-2019 ,5.0,No wondering this gem has so many great reviews!!! Arrive before 7:00 to avoid a long wait ...though it would be worth a wait too. SO many amazing tapas choices - not sure you'd go wrong with any at all....and be sure to grab the bread pudding too!
211,13-09-2019 ,5.0,The tapas are amazing.picked the menu and ordered all the tapas and gonna say thats the best decision i made in barcelona.
212,12-09-2019 ,5.0,"I love, love, love this place! They have amazing tapas - the huevos cabreados is a must try. Be prepared to wait a bit during rush hour (anytime after 8pm) - it is definitely worth the wait."
213,11-09-2019 ,5.0,"We were lucky to have a hotel 3 minutes away from this place. Ate there twice on a 4-day trip. Yes, there is a long wait, which is a good sign in my book. We were lucky to wait no more than 10 minutes each time by grabbing 2 seats at the bar.Bar seating was great because we could point at things in the display that looked good. They did a great job pacing the meal so we didn't get all of our food at once. Wine was flowing at ~3 euro a glass. All of the food items were reasonably priced as well.Can't miss dishes for us were the pulpo (octopus), Spanish omelette and churros."
214,11-09-2019 ,5.0,Lovely restaurant with lots of seating but remains very busy and often there is a queue outside. The staff were helpful in finding me a seat. The menu is good with a grand selection of tapas dishes. These were served promptly with a smile. Great tasting food. 
215,11-09-2019 ,4.0,"Great tapas place. Is a machine well oiled, however at night you can wait more than an hour on the street to get a table. You can go at lunch time, the wait is none but the menu is limited. At least you get most of the classics. Choose your poison and enjoy"
216,9-09-2019 ,5.0,"We were around Palais d Gracia this afternoon and found this tapas bar thru raving reviews from a Chinese app similar to Travel Advisor/Yelp. We came around 15:30 today and had to wait for a table for about 10-15mins since they were packed. We've ordered several tapas according to what was recommended on the app, including skewered shrimps, french fries mixed with half-boiled egg, foie gras with steak on french bread, salmon on french bread, grilled cuttlefish, razor clams, fried green peppers, leche flan and of course red wine sangria. We've enjoyed all the dishes that we've ordered, particularly the freshness of the seafood. All of the service staff are friendly and speaks very good English, particularly the kuyas and ates there. The service was efficient and fast, significantly faster than most tapas bar I've been to here in Barcelona. Overall, this tapas bar is definitely worth the wait. Great food, efficient service and reasonably priced. What more can you ask for! One recommendation to the restaurant though, please have a menu with pictures to help tourists who doesn't know any Spanish, or English to order more variety of tapas."
217,9-09-2019 ,5.0,"The best tapas in Barcelona, definitely worth visiting this place. While there was a waiting list of ~30 mins, we enjoyed every minute of this amazing restaurant. There were many different tapas (really enjoyed the one with steak and those with shrimps). I strongly recommend this place for travellers to Barcelona."
218,9-09-2019 ,5.0,"Their service is very responsive and friendly.For the exceptional quality of food, the prices are very reasonable.I would highly recommend the octopus, escalibada, eggplant chips, huevos caballeros, etc.If you’re staying in the Eixample neighborhood, this is a must try.The portions of some of the tapas are quite filling and not just bite sized.So please order accordingly.BonApetit!"
219,8-09-2019 ,1.0,"I travel and eat out a lot. Eating at a restaurant is not just about filling someone's belly. It's about the experience. Now, I'm the kind of person who tries to make the best of any situation. However, this experience pushed me to a point of no return. And here is why: First, after waiting an hour to be seated, the hostess herded us next to customers seated at the bar and told us to wait to be seated. I figured since my name had been called our table was ready and shouldn't have to wait again to be seated. Then the person ushering us to our table, rudely grabbed the menu out of my husband's hands he was reviewing while waiting. She said, ""you don't need a menu, I have one for you."" Then when our waiter finally arrived, we started to ask questions about the menu and he barked, ""Drinks first!! Then food!!"" So we ordered our drinks and asked about good things on the menu. One of the suggestions was the Flower of Zucchini in tempura. Now when it arrived, it looked like a puff pastry with cheese inside. I was expecting tempura zucchini. This was my bad for not understanding the menu. But I opened up the puff of tempura to see what was inside and a ton of cheese oozed out. I asked for it to be returned as it was not what I was expecting. The waiter said, since it's clearly marked flower of zucchini on the menu they could not return it. Irrespective of who's fault it was, this is not how you treat a guest. The matter was handled poorly. Especially when it comes down to 2 euros at cost. So we paid for our meal. And left. And will never return.We ended up going to a delicious Italian restaurant just down the street called Il Massone Ristorante & Pizzeria. They are family owned and very nice. We immediately felt cared for and taken care of as soon as we entered. And the food was delicious! I would say skip Catalana and go to Massone Ristorante & Pizzeria if you want a nice dinner."

Suckling pig was Devine, all of the tapas was flavour some. I enjoyed every bit of dinner. There was a huge line and it was definitely worth the wait. I have recommended this place to all of my friends who have travelled to Barcelona "
221,7-09-2019 ,5.0,"Cervecería Catalana is a brewery and a tapas restaurant in Barcelona.It is considered best place where you can taste the best tapas in town.Go with shrimps on sticks, green pepper, tomato bred, jamon, grilled camembert, everything! All kinds of food are wow wow wow, the best food that i have ever tasted, tapas are so yummy."
222,6-09-2019 ,2.0,"We visited this restaurant expecting a good meal as it was busy all day, people waiting for tables and good reviews. Sadly we were very disappointed. The service was poor, particularly by one waiter who did not interact with us at all. We were handed menus and expected to order virtually immediately with no explanation. We ordered drinks and had to remind our waiter we had not received the glass of beer. My wine had a fly in it and when I showed it to the waiter he looked at me as if I was totally odd. All I wanted was a clean glass.The tapas came with lightening speed and it was clear they were very keen for us and the neighbouring tables to eat and depart. We felt we were in the “Maccas” of tapas. I would not return."
223,6-09-2019 ,5.0,we went there for our last lunch in Barcelona. busy place but no line. we have a few tapa with dessert. food was excellent and service was great. they are a little different than the tapa places you see all over Barcelona. they are a little more expensive but the quality of food is much better especially the seafood and the dessert. totally need to go try
224,6-09-2019 ,5.0,I visited Barcelona 5.th times in August and all my visits always have dinner in Cerveceria Catalana best sangria ever and tapas also fishes and other seafoods very delicious and good price for this quality.
225,5-09-2019 ,5.0,"Tried this restaurant after a recommendation and succeeded in getting a table on our last night in Barcelona, and we’re so glad we persevered. Tapas is absolutely fantastic, and extremely reasonably priced. Highlights are the beef tenderloin with foie, and prawns and asparagus skewers. Tip - book or go early."
226,5-09-2019 ,5.0,"Food enters through the eyes first. This place has a bar with a glass window. As soon as you enter you see (and smell) all the delicious tapas, tortillas and fresh fish they have to offer.I tried several of their own best, like the candied pear and gorgonzola montadito... amazing. The ambience is fun but relaxed. Fast waiters, fair price. If you go to Barcelona, don’t miss this place."
227,5-09-2019 ,4.0,"Food was delicious, place has comfortable baby chairs. We came across a shift change and we weren't that much happy with service but they are good, fast and clean."
228,4-09-2019 ,5.0,"Great tapas with great prices , even that it’s very touristic , food super fresh service is fast and very professional Definitely recommend"
229,3-09-2019 ,5.0,"Amazing.. Book today if you are traveling to Barcelona! You will love, great food and have the best time."
230,2-09-2019 ,5.0,"Super fast service. Everything we ate was excellent: navajas, croquetas, frituras. Bread pudding is incredible. Very good service as well"
231,31-08-2019 ,5.0,We stopped here on our last day in Barcelona to grab a bite to eat before heading to the airport. The food was so good we were mad we waited u til our last day. The beef tenderloins with Foie! Just get it. You’ll thank me later.
232,31-08-2019 ,5.0,"This is a great tapas restaurant. Somewhat of a local place but so famous many people there. So many great items that you can't go wrong, but the Galacian clams were fabulous, so simple and elegant."
233,30-08-2019 ,5.0,good food and service. we loved the cod fish with garlic and tomato sauce and the burnt mayo on top.all tapas and pinchos were great. Recommendable
234,30-08-2019 ,5.0,"Fantastic Tapas, we had the prawn and avocado on toast, anchovies, salt cod fritters. Dessets are only 2.50 Euro each - we had two each. We had a G&T and it was the biggest one I think I have ever had anyone put for me. You can't book and it becomes crazy from around 7.30 onwards so get there early"
235,29-08-2019 ,5.0,"Everything was wonderful. The food, the service and the ambiance ! It was definitely worth the 30 minute wait"
236,29-08-2019 ,5.0,"Restaurant is always very crowded and it's not possible to reserve a table. You have to go inside, find the ""mistress of tables"" and put your name on the list. She will tell you when to return. We were here the first time during our trip to Barcelona last October and had to return during our Mediterranean cruise this year in May.Atmosphere is quite hectic, loud and the tables are placed very tight. But since it's about tapas and not about a Gourmet dinner we didn't sense this something bad. Just on the contrary we had some nice talks with the people sitting next to us, got some good recommendations what to order next or later on gave some to others.Every single tapas we ordered was delicious. It was definitely the best tapas we ever had (and we are big tapas fans and tried a lot). We used to order 2-3 tapas at once and repeat several times. You should try the patatas bravas, the small bread with chorizo and the small dessert with fruits. It's all phenomenal! Don't get discouraged by the crowd and the waiting time. It's really worth it!"
237,29-08-2019 ,5.0,"No exaggeration, this was my favorite restaurant during my entire visit in Spain (San Sebastián included). I can’t even name all the things we ate but every single dish was incredible- and each one the “best” that I had during my trip (best croquettes, best “patatas brava”, best sangria etc.). We actually ran into this place and didn’t know how well reviewed it was, and are so grateful we did! Also, a little bit classier of a restaurant than several of the other authentic and highly reviewed tapas places (without being pricy), so wear that cute outfit that you brought on your trip and are saving for something legit and eat your brains out. Special shout out to their take on patatas bravas if like me, you love the perfect crunch!"
238,27-08-2019 ,5.0,"We were walking to Las Ramblas and passed by this restaurant. The aroma of the food captivated us first and then we saw the crowd waiting to get in! We all know that we must come back and we did! It was a fabulous meal! The menu have too many items to look at, it was hard to order when there are so many options! We did managed and order seafood and various dishes that I cannot recall the names but I remembered the taste! It was wonderful!!!"
239,24-08-2019 ,5.0,Read the reviews and decided to give this a chance. Was not disappointed. We went early by Barcelona standards so got in quickly. Tasty food and huge variety. Would not call it cutting edge in terms of experimental cuisines but in any city that has a lot of tourists it is easy to get bad or mediocre food. This certainly was not. By the time we left the queue was out the door. 
240,24-08-2019 ,5.0,"After a couple of average dinners in the city, it was worth the planning to get here early enough to get a table without a wait! Great fresh tapas, quick but friendly service and fantastic desserts. And they pour a mean g&t too!"
241,21-08-2019 ,5.0,"It’s a VERY busy place! People are lining up at the door and directly behind you. The dining options are: alfresco table service dining, inside table service dining or you can choose to be informal and sit on a bar chair in front of the service area. This place is very fast paced but has the most amazing food! We were so impressed with the food that we came a second night during our short stay. There was great service and very fresh & tasty food. My husband loved the sangria. It’s a must visit! "
242,19-08-2019 ,5.0,"Great restaurant in Barcelona. This restaurant was recommended to us by our friends, and it did not disappoint. Excellent food and a very nice atmosphere as well. You may want to make a recommendation, however we only had a 15 minute wait time so it was fine as well."
243,18-08-2019 ,5.0,"A friend of mine had read about this place and we met there. It was VERY crowded, but fortunately we got 2 seats at the bar. We ordered a little bottle of cava, razor clams, pintxo of beef tenderloin with foie gras, and other tapas. Everything was fantastic. The highlight had to be the bartender, fantastic service, funny/witty personality. This is a MUST in Barcelona. "
244,18-08-2019 ,5.0,"This place is been there for ever, locals and tourist go there. Nice mix of people from families, couple and friends. When in Barcelona I always stop there for caña y una tapita. Salud "
245,18-08-2019 ,5.0,Place is highly in demand. Waiting list longer inside . Bar is quick way to get a spot as .people leaves. Food is great !! Tapas the best !! worth the wait. Very busy place and a little bit noisy. Noise does not matter it was the food.. Sangria is wonderful !!!Great place to walk because it is close to Las Ramblas.
246,17-08-2019 ,5.0,"We stopped several times and it was always an hour plus wait, maybe because there are five of us. On our last night we decided it must be worth the wait. And no matter how long the wait is it is worth it. The selection is great and prices fair. I don’t speak Spanish however I felt like the waiter was pushing us to order more than we wanted. We got what we wanted and it was the best."
247,15-08-2019 ,5.0,"We spent 3 days in Barcelona, we went different restaurants, but Cerveceria Catalana was our best choice, we came back couple times. It is delicious and affordable. Everything you try is great. Ask for dry Sangria, less sugar more alcohol. Service is great and fast."
248,13-08-2019 ,4.0,"Good range of tapas, relatively fast service and options for vegetarians. Little puddings were nice, especially the chocolate on bread with oil and salt for something a little bit different but a nice end to a meal."
249,12-08-2019 ,5.0,"Omg, this place is amazing!! We where in Barcelona for 2 1/2 days, had dinner and a late lunch on separate days. This is definitely a jewel!! I recommend before 7pm. After 7, be ready to wait at least an hour, and there are NO reservations! However, the hour goes quickly due to the ambiance and people watching! Love, Love love cant wait to go back and re-order all the tapas we had with the best dessert ever, it’s baked at the moment-bread pudding!!"
250,10-08-2019 ,5.0,"You simply must go to this place when in Barcelona!The food is just amazing, garlic shrimps to die for, and the atmosphere is outta this world! Such an awesome experience, that the waiting for the table becomes fun as well.Don’t be intimidated by the time to wait the hostess tells you, it’s really shorter, and every minute of wait is worth it!For dessert make sure you get the bread pudding."
251,10-08-2019 ,5.0,Great experience and very tasty food. Very fast and friendly service. Definitely need to book a table in advance.
252,9-08-2019 ,5.0,Probably the most enjoyable Tapas outlet we visited.The range of food was good and not so reliant on seafood as many outlets in Barcelona are.Although it is very busy the staff noticed and acknowledged you.
253,8-08-2019 ,4.0,"Great experience and great food. I would have given it a five if hadn't been for the wait time. My wife and I finally went there around noontime, (after three previous attempts), which is kind of early and was able to get a table. "
254,8-08-2019 ,5.0,The whole experience was verry good . Thay have a lot of Spanish food experience . Verry fast service .
255,7-08-2019 ,4.0,"This place is POPULAR. We tried one evening and there were so many people waiting that we gave up. We tried again for a lunch around 3pm and got seated within 5min. They were out of the rice specialty that is only served at lunch - as we came too late - but otherwise all the dishes were excellent. Favorites were the hot peppers, the seafood croquette, the garlic shrimp - so good we had two! They also have various sandwiches and traditional tapas, so something for everyone. The experience is fast-paced and busy, but enjoyable - definitely not the right place for a quiet calm meal. Would highly recommend if you can brave the wait!"
256,7-08-2019 ,5.0,Great Tapas! A festival of flavors. You have to go there and try tapas all you can eat. It was wonderful. Fried and pickle anchovies were great. Steak with lung was incredible! Also deserts were fantastic.
257,7-08-2019 ,5.0,"We came here on our first night in Barcelona and had the most unbelievable meal. There was a 40 min queue for a table but we put our names down and just went for a drink so it’s definitely worth it. The food was unbelievable and very reasonable, staff were lovely and accommodating. The white sangria is fabulousAlso have the beef tenderloin montadito- you won’t regret it!Thank you Cerveceria Catalana❤️"
258,7-08-2019 ,5.0,Expect at least 30 min wait once you leave your name at door. We went at lunchtime and popped for a quick beer at another bar while waiting. Sangria was lovely and the crisp egg plant was unexpected tasty surprise.
259,4-08-2019 ,5.0,The tapas are AMAZING also the atmosphere is fantastic! Definitely going back. This place is perfect for lunch and it is rather hectic which is very nice! 
260,4-08-2019 ,5.0,DIM DOWN THE LIGHTS in the back section. Feels like you are in McDonald’s and we heard another table request the same thing and were hoping they would!Tapas were very good and good service overall. Would recommend if you can sit in the front section otherwise take your sunglasses.
261,4-08-2019 ,5.0,Having been to quite a few tapas places whilst in Barcelona this is hands down the best we had as well as just the best food in general. The restaurant is popular so be prepared to wait if going at busy times. We went at 7 got seated inside straight away but when we left a lot of people waiting for both indoor and outdoor seating. The food is delicious. They have a daily tapas menu as well as their regular tapas menu so lots of choice. Must haves would be the beef tenderloins and chicken andBacon croquettes they were just divine. Would also massively recommend getting a dessert the chocolate cake was fantastic. The service was also great super quick and they look after you check you have got everything etc. If you are in Barcelona you have to try this place at some point. Prices I would say are really reasonable and based on the quality of the dishes I think fantastic value as I would have paid more for that. 
262,4-08-2019 ,5.0,"Easily the best tapas in town. Delicious food, vibrant atmosphere, efficient staff. Make sure you get a reservation or arrive by 7pm to guarantee a seat. It was queued up on a Sunday evening as we left at 8pm. Everything is amazing especially the beef tenderloin on french bread. Wow! So succulent. For tapas in Barcelona, get yourself here!!"
263,4-08-2019 ,5.0,"This was my second time visiting this place and it was just as amazing as I had remembered. They have a baked Camembert dish which is unreal. Service is fantastic and all the staff are happy to help. Great value with tapas, bottle of wine and a couple of soft drinks costing €63A definite visit if in Barca! "
264,3-08-2019 ,1.0,"Terrible service, Filipina waitress all are very rude, very arrogant not friendly. They are only friendly to Caucasians. After taking orders didn’t repeat what the customer ordered and blamed the customer for not telling them before eating the dish which was placed on our table. Worst service. Didn’t apologise still keep repeating “next time must tell them first before you eat!!! “ I think you must send all your staff including the manager for training, They are not professionally trained. The Filipina waitress who attended to us while she was talking, her saliva spilled out and we have to move the glass of drink away from her. The food here was overrated, the razor clams supposed to be grilled, but what they served us was like half cooked, Food was not fantastic, crispy cuttlefish is not crispy, is like eating rubber and no taste at all. Terrible customer service and lousy food, will definitely not recommending to our friends and will never come back to this restaurant again."
265,2-08-2019 ,4.0,"Though it's place which is popular with tourists, it has a wonderful ambience and good tapas. The service was good and our server, Muzzamil, was very attentive,As they do not take bookings, there's a daily queue outside, so it's best to calculate the waiting time when one wants to go there."
266,30-07-2019 ,5.0,"Great dinner! A very busy spot. Heavy on the tourist side, but gave it a nice vibe. Short wait, but worth it. Very quick and efficient service. Tapas was all very tasty, including their specials. Highly recommended for a good tapas experience in the area. "
267,30-07-2019 ,5.0,"Every time I go, the experience is absolutely delicious. We always eat like there’s no tomorrow and every dish is just irresistible. A true jewel popular among the streets in Barcelona. "
268,30-07-2019 ,5.0,The food was really good and the service fantastic and fast. Had heard good reviews for that place and indeed they deserve them. The portions are good and for sure value for money. Would definitely go again!! Keep up the good work guys!!
269,29-07-2019 ,5.0,"Best place we found in Barcelona! This place is a gold mine. It is always full, so reservations are HIGHLY recommended and when you get there you will still have to wait, but it will be worth it. Bring the address with you because it seems the locals are not too helpful and/or have never heard of this place. We spent a few hours asking several people where we could locate this place because our internet was not functioning on our phone and not one was able to help us, not even at the hotel!!. Turns out the restaurant was literally two blocks away from our hotel! Keep this address handy if you decide to go Carrer de Mallorca, 236, 08008 Barcelona, Spain. This is located on a side street probably less than half a block off Paseo de Gracia. If you get there and can get a seat at the bar, do so and just eat at the bar. We didn't make reservations so we had a 1 1/2 hour wait time. We just stood behind some folks and when they were done we squished into the bar and just ate there. It wasn't exactly the dinner we had planned because you are cramped up by the people waiting for a table or to take your seat at the bar, but the food was so good, we overlooked that. We had the red sangria which was delicious. We also ordered the eggs with fries (cabreaos), croquetas, the steak with foie gras on top, the montaditos, the pulpitos with a potato mash underneath them, crab montaditos, fried camembert cheese and we stuffed the churros and chocolate at the end because we couldn't leave Barcelona without trying that! I wish we would have had a table to enjoy a relaxed meal because everything was delicious and the best part is that it's very affordable in comparison to other places we visited in Barcelona. I see many comments saying it's a touristy place, but on the day we went it was packed with locals so the food must be authentic when they visit. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."
270,27-07-2019 ,5.0,Go and try everything! You will love it!. We had a grand old time when we stopped by there after 5 o'clock and had a taste with the locals.
271,26-07-2019 ,5.0,"This place is worth the wait! Came on a Wednesday at 3pm and grabbed a seat at the bar within 15 minutes. Restaurant decor was stunning. Received friendly service with perfect English from everyone we met, including the lovely hostess, servers and barman.Recommendations:- Razor clams- Grilled cuttlefish- Mixed seafood grill- Beef tenderloin & foie gras pinchos (!!!)Truly incredible - one of the best meals we’ve had in Barcelona! Will be back!"
272,26-07-2019 ,5.0,"I've visited this restaurant before and had to return. The queue outside is a bit off-putting but if you just want a seat at the bar then its only a short wait until someone else leaves and its definitely worth it!Theres lots to chose from and the food comes quickly and is absolutely lovely. We had a variety of tapas and loved every single one. Worth the wait and would definitely recommend to anyone going to barcelona, will come back again!"
273,24-07-2019 ,5.0,"It's as good as everyone says, but. . . We waited half an hour, and it was worth it. The second time the wait was an hour an a half, and we decided it wasn't that good. The tapas were varied and delicious. The sangria (red and white) was delicious. The service was fast and attentive after we were seated. "
274,23-07-2019 ,5.0,"After hearing a lot of good things about this place, I was worried this was going to be overrated but the food was definitely amazing!! Everything we got, from the pulpo/octopus to the peppers, was very delicious. We came here the day after going to Ciudad Condal and realized they have almost the same menu. We learned they were basically sister restaurants and we got some of the same dishes. They were very consistent and the seafood was fresh and seasoned very simply, bringing out the flavors very well. The place is crowded because it is very popular but worth the wait and you can walk around the area while waiting."
275,22-07-2019 ,5.0," Cerveceria Catalana has a very similar menu to Ciudad Condal, so we ordered totally different tapas.Everything our server recommended was beyond delicious:- cod with honey aioli (such a surprise and so delicious)- grilled cuttlefish- Spanish omeletteWe also ordered the patatas bravas and tomato bread and iberico ham. For dessert, we had the bread pudding and we were so thankful we saved room for dessert. The bread pudding is one of the best desserts I’ve ever eaten (this is coming from someone who doesn’t care for sweets).You must visit at least once if you are going to be in Barcelona!"
276,22-07-2019 ,5.0,We came for lunch before visiting Gaudi and judging from the outside we knew it was a popular place . There was a long queue going all the way out of the restaurant plus we could smell the nice aroma of the food wafting in the air. We were lucky to have a table within 10 minutes. We all had small bites like tapas and finished off with sangria with white wine. I could only say all the food tasted out of this world.
277,21-07-2019 ,4.0,"The food is great, but it is not possible to book a table in advance and this restaurant is so popular. People were standing in a long line waiting for a table the whole night. If you're going, be prepared to wait for at least 30 min. "
278,21-07-2019 ,5.0,"I sat at the bar, arriving early (noon). By the time I was finished at 12:45 the line was snaking out the block. Food is excellent, solomillo con foie and their gambas al ajillo is top knotch"
279,19-07-2019 ,5.0,"We went to the restaurant on our last night in Barcelona. As we were seated, this waiter told us we had two hours. We assured him it would be no problem for us to be out in two hours. That was not true. We ate for two solid hours and they had to throw us out. The food was fabulous. We really liked the peppers, the tortilla and the churros and chocolate, the Sangria, the mushrooms. Really, there wasn't a bad dish on the table. We were a group of 7 with a vegetarian and 3 picky teens and everyone loved their meal. Our tip is to get there a little early by Spanish standards so you can get a table. We sent members of our group down earlier than the rest to get our names on the list. Worth the wait!"
280,19-07-2019 ,5.0,"The atmosphere in Cerveceria Catalana was awesome and very lively. We ordered a liter of sangria at the bar while we waited for a table and took it with us when we were seated. Our favorites were the honey baked cod, and the sweet eggplant. The tapas were very authentic and came out as they were ready. There seemed to be a great mix of local and tourists, and all were welcome. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great tapas experience in Barcelona."
281,18-07-2019 ,4.0,"Very nice tapas restaurant. Food is good and quite authentic. We ate here twice after a recommendation from some locals. Service is efficient, almost overly so though if you like to linger over your meal."
282,16-07-2019 ,5.0,By befriending someone on the hop on hop off bus we learned about this place. What a win. It was super busy be we were still able to get a table for 9 people. The tapas were amazing. We mostly went with the daily menu. Everything was fresh and prepared so well. We will come back next time we are in the city.
283,15-07-2019 ,5.0,good tapasnow lot better than ciudad comdal best quality pricemontadidos are a must have go there asap
284,14-07-2019 ,5.0,Must go in Barcelona .This was the best tapas place I tried in the city .It was close to where I was staying and was packed from morning to night .The food is fresh and delicious.Its fine dine inside and big enough so it’s not tight like few other tapas bars I went to.
285,13-07-2019 ,5.0,"We loved this place! We sat at the counter and shared a number of tapas - including tenderloin and foie gras, asparagus and mushrooms, an egg dish and some montaditos. Everything was delicious, not to mention extremely affordable. Great place to start with a few tapas and order more if hungry. It had a fun atmosphere as well. The outdoor seating is really cute but closed by 11 so get there before then if you want to sit outside. "
286,12-07-2019 ,5.0,This place is different.First of all the food is excellent.It's very busy. No reservations.When you get there put your name on the list inside and the list outside. They're not the same.Had great sangria and just loved the food.The service was great too.My only complaint is not the restaurants fault.we sat outside and patrons can still smoke as long as it's outside.Both tables next to us had heavy smokers and it did ruin the food and atmosphere a little.Still I would go back to this lively restaurant with excellent food.1/2 litre of white and 1/2 litre of red sangria plus food $91 euros
287,11-07-2019 ,4.0,"We got there at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night and the line was already out the door and almost around the corner just to put our name down! The wait for a table was an hour (we shopped at the Mango across the street and time flew!). Unfortunately, by the time we were seated, all the items on their daily menu were sold out, which seemed like poor planning! I'm a vegetarian and wasn't that impressed with the offerings on their regular menu, but my husband said it's the best food he's had in our 2 days in Spain thus far, so it was worth the wait! My husband says: ""the seafood is all good; the razor clam was awesome, the dish with shrimp, cuttlefish and octopus was better than the garlic shrimp."" The kids LOVED the Spanish omelette. We felt the sangria was good, but not great. But the desserts were awesome! We got the crema catalina and the 3 layer chocolate cake. Service was excellent: they were so patient with our cranky kids and one of the waiters even bought over red wine stain remover for the woman sitting next to us! Overall, I'm glad we went, but I wish that the restaurant would have more consideration for people who wait an hour to eat there in terms of planning their daily menu."
288,10-07-2019 ,5.0,"Best Sangria ever !!! People were great , bar and inside table. Wonderful choices of Tapas !!! pleasant server and you get great advise for a first timer. After inital experience, you want more."
289,10-07-2019 ,4.0,"Went there for a dinner. Their tapas are the best, wide variety, portion is not small as some places, taste is delicious, you have to try garlic prawns, batata bravas, tomato bread, and anything you desire a definite place to visit"
290,9-07-2019 ,5.0,Seafood and the foie gras & beef tendedloin tapa are highly recommended! Great happiness in every bite. We can never forget the taste of the foie gras and beef tenderloin! Try their churros too. They are unexpectedly good.
291,9-07-2019 ,5.0,"We love this place. Came here three times during our visit to Barcelona. Restaurant is always busy but it stays open all day so if you go during non peak hours, you will get seated. The first two visits, we sat at the bar. The pace is a bit more relaxed even though you have people surrounding you ready to pounce for your seats when you are done. The third time we got a table as there were more of us. Service is fast. Wouldn’t say the wait staff is too personable but they are efficient. They just want you to eat and go. But we were in a hurry so it didn’t matter to us. Hostess wasn’t overly friendly either but given that she is bombarded with customers all day, can’t really blame her.The food here is fantastic and consistent. Best patatas bravas, always extra crispy. The grilled seafood are fresh and seasoned well. We ordered the razor clams, clams, cuttlefish, and prawns. The foie gras on beef was a hit at the table as well as the asparagus and mushroom. First time my son willingly ate mushrooms. The Spanish tortilla was meh, a bit runny and the shrimp in garlic was just ok. Bread pudding dessert was fantastic. My kids loved crema Catalan, wasn’t for me though. Thicker than a creme brûlée but not as “eggy” as a flan. There are many other items I would have loved to try but we went back to our favorites."
292,7-07-2019 ,5.0,"This was our first meal in Barcelona and although it took a while to sit our party of 9, it was worth the wait. We had too many tapas to name but they were all very good. Here is one recommendation...the Bread pudding is amazing! You Can’t go wrong if you choose to stop here. Have a beer or glass of wine while you wait for your table and get ready for some great tapas and desserts."
293,6-07-2019 ,5.0,"This is my 8th trip to Barcelona and I would say there’s never a trip that I Havnt visited this place. For this trip I went twice. The first was two days ago. I went at 5 pm to avoid the longer lines. However, last night I waited for almost 2 hours to get to sit on a table and order but I would say the wait is worth it. The longer the wait the tastier the food so to speak. The receptionist Mavel was very nice and patient and showed a lot of poise despite the chaotic reservation line and Antonio was very nice and accommodating. Till next trip."
294,6-07-2019 ,5.0,"My husband, and I went for tapas here after a local recommended it to us. There are many many choices and also shared dishes. The langoustine was AMAZING, croquetas, and shrimp in garlic sauce were also delicious. Despite not taking reservations, we were able to be seated in 30 min on a Friday night. Also service is fast and pleasant. This place expects a tip! "
295,6-07-2019 ,5.0,This is an excellent place for tapas and sangria. They only have a few outside tables do if this is where you would like to sit I recommend getting there by 5:30 . I recommend the eggplant chops ! Chocolate and churros also a delight . Never had a bad tapas !
296,5-07-2019 ,5.0,"We visited Cerveseria Catalana the other evening about 8:30 and despite the throngs lining up for tables, we were able to find seats at the bar within half an hour. The service was prompt and efficient, but the food quality blew us away. We shared about half dozen different small plates, but it was the steamed cod that was the highlight of our visit. Don’t miss it! No advance reservations are accepted, so either go early or prepare for a long wait. Beer and cava make the time go fast. A bonus - prices are reasonable!"
297,5-07-2019 ,5.0,"Very charming, especially the tables on the street. Delicious tapas!!! One better than the other. Price ok, worth the food and service. Restaurant very full with some waiting to get your table, especially outside. Unless you go there in between the “rush hours” of lunch and dinner. I was in Barcelona for 3 days and went there twice. Would have gone more if I could! :):):)"
298,4-07-2019 ,5.0,"We went there for lunch yesterday. Great service, food was brought extremely quickly. Waiters were friendly and efficient. Food was amazing and prices are reasonable.Definitely worth the visit! Recommend it!"
299,4-07-2019 ,5.0,Loved the buffet style and only paying for what you pick. My students enjoyed trying new things! The service was amazing as well!
300,4-07-2019 ,4.0,"I love the food, the atmosphere, you just need to take under consideration that in the evening you will be waiting to get a table, but this is part of the experience! enjoy talking to people from around the world."
301,3-07-2019 ,5.0,"I was recommended Cerveceria Catalana by a friend who said it was worth the wait for a table - and he couldn't have been more correct. The restaurant is set on a traditional Barcelona street with the normal hustle and bustle of a big city. They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait. We went on a Saturday night, arriving at 7:45 p.m. and for a table for three waited 55 minutes to be seated. There are a few tables outside on the street, but they are mostly small and with all of the people waiting and walking by, it's not much of an intimate atmosphere. They also have a bar that has a lot of seating but is very busy. This is a typical tapas style restaurant. Each of the three people in our party ordered 2-4 dishes, some cold, some hot. They have an extensive wine list and it is very reasonably priced (we paid around €15 for an entire bottle). The first dish I ordered was Assorted of 'Ibericos' which had three different types of jamon and cheese as well. It was a fantastic combination of flavors. I also ordered a montadito of beef tenderloin and foie gras. It was cooked perfectly (though it was my first foie gras experience and I realized the consistency isn't for me) and the bread it came on added great contrast. My favorite dish was called ""Cabreaos egg style"" which consisted of potatos with an egg that the waiter mixed into the dish table-side, covered in some kind of amazing sauce. I would eat that every day if I could.Other dishes ordered by my family included more beef tenderloin, chicken salad, mushrooms and asparagus and a few seafood dishes that were enjoyed by all. For dessert I went with traditional churros that came with a decadent warm chocolate sauce. The atmosphere inside was loud but not distracting. The only issue we ran into was there were a few dishes (scallops particularly) that they had run out of by the time we were seated. Also, they did bring one dish that we didn't order, but took it back and didn't charge us for it. The service was adequate and the prices were good value. All in all, if you have the time to wait, this is definitely a place to stop in while in Barcelona."
302,2-07-2019 ,4.0,"The food here is great, the service friendly, the price is very correct.....but we had to wait and wait, even when we got the table we waited for dreinks, then for the food, and the bill for a while."
303,1-07-2019 ,4.0,"Be prepared for a long wait. It is extremely popular. It is for good reason: The food is outstanding. The wine list is great. Ironically, I would not bother with a beer because there are beer drink choices for the food.When I go, I usually go down the street for a beer to kill time before I get my table. The bar area is traditionally small as many other places in Barcelona, and the sidewalk is packed. You are best served going somewhere for a while to kill time. for what's worth, their seating time estimates are quite accurate. Incidentally, if you miss your seating slot, you will quickly lose it, so be timely.Service is fast and very good. While they will never rush you out, they are fast and efficient in the hopes you leave 'quickly' (remember the long wait?) This is by no means a bad thing."
304,30-06-2019 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was recommended to me by my tour guide. It did not disappoint. I enjoyed razor clams, Galician octopus, Tortilla, eggplant chips and pan con tomate. All very fresh and delicious. We were lucky and got in after a 30 minute wait. Service was very attentive and professional. The restaurant itself is well appointed and modern. Elevated Tapa. "
305,29-06-2019 ,4.0,"Wife and I stayed at a hotel in the area when we visited Barcelona. Wanted to find a Tapas restaurant in Barcelona that was highly regarded and came across Cereceria Barcelona. Spain is a different culture than in the Americas, dinner and going out to dine starts way later in the evening so to find something for lunch/dinner your choices are either bakeries, chain restaurants or fast food joints. Be prepared to wair for a table if you come here because it is busy even with it's rather large dining room and outdoor patios. The menu was chocked full of tapas choices, there are Engish translations to what was on the meny. Being Tapas you should start off with about 4-5 menu items then decide what you feel like if you order again. Disappointing to the whole dining experience was that I was not given any beer menu. The name if the resteraunt has the word, ""cerveceria"" which means brewery but I when I ordered I was only given the choice of ordering the standard beers that you could buy at the convenience stores. If you are travelling to Barcelona, this is one place to try out."
306,29-06-2019 ,4.0,"Atmosphere was bustling. This was recommended by our concierge Mark at alma hotel. It was worth it. Very busy. We went there after a long day visiting museum and got there at 7pm. There was a wait but we were called in about 15 mins. Our waiter was good,tapas choices and drinks were excellent. Price was reasonable. No reservations here so it's first come first served. We chose to sit at a table but there is also a bar if you prefer. Second time we went there was an hour wait so we had to eat elsewhere. Check it out if you can. It was a 5 min walk from our hotel"
307,29-06-2019 ,5.0,"We had several fantastic tapas: razor clams, zucchini & goat cheese tower (outstanding), squid and small fish & the desserts were equally amazing. Highly recommend. "
308,29-06-2019 ,1.0,"We have been there and the woman at the reception told us that we have to wait for 20 minutes. We told her it’s okay, she took our names. We waited for 40min, I went to see her to ask her why does it takes so long. She acted like she did not recognised me and told me that I have to put my name on the list again.I told her that i was already on the list for 40min.She became agressive and told me that i wasnt on the list.I tried to show her my name on the list, she didnt let me. And when i found it, she told me that it was someone else.Not serious from a restaurant that I’m used to visit every time i come to barcelona. And i always bring friends with me.I came here for 100 times at least. But i think because of this person at the reception that I’ll never come back.I was ready to wait to have a table but she acted really bad and didnt recognise her mistake.That’s not professional.Really disappointed"
309,28-06-2019 ,4.0,"Is worth the visit a good experience , service is good and efficient, clientele mostly tourists, food is good and not very expensive, they're consistent not excellent but aceptable, very crowded all the time."
310,28-06-2019 ,1.0,"Compare to all the tapas places dotted throughout Barcelona, the food does not particularly stand out and just average. The service is definitely terrible, and the waiters are generally rude and brash. Do not waste your time and wait 1+ hour for this. Try going at quieter times if you must try like pre noon and early-mid afternoon."
311,28-06-2019 ,5.0,"It was worth waiting over 1 hour to get a table. Probably the best tapas i ever eatten. Just delicious. Very good service. It is not cheap (100€ for 2 person) but worth it. Tip: menu is quite long, so if you are not sure just ask waiter to choose and order tapas for you."
312,26-06-2019 ,5.0,"Lovley place! Really crowded when we arrived at 7. We wanted a table outside so we had to wait and after 45 min A wonderfull waiter in the bar offered us two seats in the bar instead. I really recommend sitting in the bar, it was a lot of fun! The waiter was really kind and we felt really taken care of even tough the place was crowded! The staff was really kind! The food was amazing, really nice! Seafood was super fresh. I highly Recommend, we will deffinitley come back here many times! "
313,24-06-2019 ,5.0,Visited here as a result of a review in the Eye Witness travel guide and I was not disappointed. One of the daily specials was the squid and it was amazing. It was a bit daunting sitting at the bar on my own but the staff were very helpful and I'm definitely glad I made the effort to visit here.
314,23-06-2019 ,3.0,"After all of the hype and recommendations, we decided to endure the wait of over an hour to get a table. The food was good, but not outstanding, and the prices were higher than other, better food we had in Barcelona. The octopus was tough--a far cry from the much better and less expensive Casa Rafols."
315,23-06-2019 ,5.0,"I have been here 3 times in a month, loved the food and the service, the team is great and they make it work perfectly.Of course waiting a lot of time to sit is not very fun, but considering the amount of people who try to eat here every night, they are really efficient.Everybody in Barcelona should visit at least once."
316,22-06-2019 ,5.0,"Our family of four went to this restaurant for dinner. The service was great and the food was excellent. The wait can be long, but coming in off hours helps - we were seated in a lovely outside table in less than 10 minutes around 6:00 pm. The calamari, tortilla, gambas, patatas bravas, etc were all too notch!"
317,20-06-2019 ,5.0,"High energy atmosphere, delicious food, good drink and made some new friends. The octopus dish was exquisite and so were the patron peppers. The place is generally crowded, but they did a good job to accommodate us. "
318,20-06-2019 ,5.0,We stayed at the balmes Hotel a few minutes walk down the street the rose wine was lovely tried a lot of food here and was not disappointed the steak with little peppers was lovely I also loved the smoked salmon and prawn with cream cheese and the patatas bravas. It can be a bit of a wait at times but found it worth the wait the very busy place was lovely and we ate here 4 nights on the run if I went back I'd go straight back there definitely 5 stars
319,20-06-2019 ,4.0,"This is very popular with tourist so be prepared to wait in line for a table. Luckily as a single diner, bar seat was immediately available. Firstly, everyone was friendly and spoke English. Service was fast. The food was hit and miss. Some tapas very yummy and some was bland. Wine by the glass choice was restrictive. Was told they only had 1 type of white wine by the glass. It is conveniently located in Eixample district. "
320,18-06-2019 ,5.0,"Always busy, but definitively worth it!!If you have a couple of days in Barcelona, you must definitively visit this placeService is fast, friendly and helpfulFood is very very good, excellent.Tapas and montaditos, house specialsDelightfulAlways a daily menu, should have them, all of them!!!Super cool!!! "
321,18-06-2019 ,5.0,"We wanted to treat ourselves for one last great meal, and we opted for a great place to east Tapas for afternoon before leaving towards the airport! Great food, we all enjoyed it! Very fast service, nice environment although it fells rushed with several staff roaming around replenishing but its understandable as this place is indeed highly frequented. We did not wait for a table at 4pm! Highly recommended are the Spanish Omelette, Cod Alvioli, Crema Catalana and Curros!"
322,18-06-2019 ,5.0,"You normally have to queue for a table here, but for breakfast on a kind of cloudy day in June, I was seated on the terrace immediately. The breakfast choices are not extensive, but they're really well priced, and the food I ended up with - a tortilla with berenjenas (aubergine), alongside tostadas con tomate (a Catalan speciality) was very good. Service speedy and friendly."
323,18-06-2019 ,5.0,"No wonder this place is triple as busy as anywhere else! Bit of a nightmare to get in, but who cares when the food is this good....!!! My word... the food is good. Would definitely recommend! Enjoy :)"
324,17-06-2019 ,5.0,"We ordered mini burgers, calamari, canaloni, goats cheese and the tomato bread and patatas bravas which were amazing. We also had and other fish meals. Some of the fish things were a little bit fishy for us. For desert we had some cookie thing which was really nice but the bread and butter pudding was soo so good. Also reallly enjoyed the sangria!"
325,17-06-2019 ,5.0,"There are a lot of great restaurants in Barcelona, but this was my favorite. There are lines outside but it is totally worth the wait. Large menu of tapas, good portion sizes, friendly waiters that are able to help you with your selection. Great vibe! Not a place for a quiet dinner. "
326,16-06-2019 ,1.0,"We asked for the menu and the staff got worst attitude, never go again for the service, better improve the staff first "
327,15-06-2019 ,3.0,This is the first restaurant that we came to after arriving to Barcelona at night. We were starving and I really wanted to visit this place given the amazing photos on other review sites. There was a very long line up despite it being 930 by the time we got there. The wait was about one hour and we were quickly placed and started ordering food.The rating for this restaurant is ultimately influenced by us going to other tapas restaurants around town. The food was good but not excellent and it seems the freshness of the seafood was lacking along with the presentation. The prices were also slightly high. I recommend checking out other similar restaurants such as Vinitus and Ciutad Condal.
328,15-06-2019 ,5.0,"We didn’t book in advance so we had to wait a very long que (more than an hour)..The food was very good! But as there are more good places, I’m not sure it’s worth the long que "
329,15-06-2019 ,5.0,"Ended up here based on a recommendation from a lovely salesperson at Hermès. Place was packed but found a seats near the bar by hostess station. These are the best seats in the house because you see the food as it is prepped and served. Bilar, from Pakistan, was AWESOME! He reminded me of a Vegas blackjack dealer dishing out tapas with ease. Highly recommend the razor clams and foie tapas. Saludos Bilar!"
330,13-06-2019 ,5.0,"Its mind blowing that there is a resto like Cerveceria Catalana. All the food we ordered taste sooooooo gooooddddd (and it looks good too). Queueing is a bit of a problem, but it was worth the wait. When we receive the check we were so shocked by the bill, so cheap. Surely will come back!"
331,13-06-2019 ,5.0,"They have the best seafood tapas in Barcelona at this place. Octopus was amazing! It gets pretty busy for dinner and is relatively hard to get a seat. However, ot is worth any extra effort that you will make to enjoy the food at this place. Don’t leave Barcelona without eating at thia place."
332,9-06-2019 ,5.0,"After reading about this restaurant we decided to come here and what a amazing choice it was. We had to wait a hour to get a table but it was worth it. Friendly staff and great service. The food was incredible and possibly the best meal I ever had eating their speciality of ‘eggs and chips’ it wont go a miss. Also eating miniature steaks, chorizo, omelet and more. So tasteful and a great vibe in the restaurant. Deserts are also recommended and the Appel tart is amazing and the carrot cake. Not too expensive either we paid €35 for a main course, desert and drinks for 2. 10/10 loved it and would come back. It’s a must for anyone in Barcelona"
333,9-06-2019 ,4.0,"Fun place that is extremely popular with tourists. Place was packed even as early as 6 pm which is extremely early to eat in Spain. Despite the whole place being tourists, the food was quite good and service was excellent. I would go back. "
334,5-06-2019 ,5.0,"This address was recommended for me by a friend for good tapas!Oh my god was he right. Had to wait for my table but i didn't mind, wasn't in a hurry. I ordered 1/2 litre of sangria, a mix of tapas follwed by dessert and coffee..32€!!!Waiters were great and very helpful. Fully recommend it and will definately be going back next time in Barcelona!!"
335,5-06-2019 ,5.0,The restaurant was extremely busy with guests waiting o be seated. The service was really five star and the food was excellent. The tapas was well prepared and great value for money. Highly recommended restaurant.
336,5-06-2019 ,5.0,"If you wish to try the famous Spanish tapas - Cerveceria Catalana is a must!Tapas will never be good enough after visiting this place.Amazing food, great atmosphere, very fast service, incredible desserts and most importantly - affordable. But be ready to wait 15 to 60 minutes until you're seated. Might seem too long but it is worth it. Visited this place twice during my one week trip to Barcelona."
337,5-06-2019 ,5.0,"Don't miss that!!!Everything was perfect! Our best Tapas experience in Barcelona! Leave your name for a table (no reservations), but stay inside and be patient if there is any empty spot for you, in the bars. The whole experience, is much more better in the bar, than in a table! So just leave your name for safety and pray for spots in the bar!"
338,4-06-2019 ,5.0,"Restaurant was highly recommended from several people. And it delivered on all fronts. Biggest caution: They don't take reservations so get there early for shortest wait. Otherwise, enjoy a drink at bar. Also, keep in mind that you don't need reservation if you want to eat at Tapas bar which is first come basis. Food was delicious and the service was excellent."
339,4-06-2019 ,4.0,"Tapas was really good! Ate jamon iberico, bread with tomato spread, cuttlefish. Sangria was also good! Went 6:30 & waited for 15 mins to be seated"
340,4-06-2019 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a great spot in the Eixample for tapas anytime of the day. Its a really fun place to hang out with a great vibe and fabulous food. We went there a few times on our short trip in groups of 5 or 6 and each time we were lucky to get a table within 10 mins. The food is great -- we tried the sangria, a few different montaditos/flautas, gambas, razor clams, patata bravas, pan con tomata, mushrooms, peppers and loved each and every dish. I can't wait to go to Barcelona and head back here again!"
341,3-06-2019 ,5.0,"So first things first - YES you would more than likely need to wait in a queue. BUT it’s more than worth it. The service is attentive and the drinks menu more than adequate but the food is simply delicious. Fresh, traditional but exciting! This is tapas like its meant to be - fast, tasty and moreish. It’s a definite must come. "
342,28-05-2019 ,5.0,"It sure is busy here but so worth the wait! In fact, we liked it so much we came here three times during out stay. The razor clams are a must, perfectly cooked and seasoned, absolutely delicious! The garlic prawns, anchovies, grilled squid and asparagus were also very fresh and cooked to perfection."
343,28-05-2019 ,5.0,"We ere twice in the past week. Both times the food and service were sensational. On top of that the price was 1/2 what I thought it would be. Several people in my family own restaurants and I’ve travelled extensively eating at great restaurants all around the world. Cervezeria Catalana is a great place to eat. There was a bit of a wait, about an hour the first time. The second time we walked in at 6pm, 5 of us, and were seated immediately. We ate until we were about to burst and had a liter of sangria. The total was 100 euro. Don’t believe the people with the one star reviews. I highly recommend this place."
344,27-05-2019 ,3.0,"CC is a large tapas restaurant in the city centre. It’s always busy so be prepared to wait for a table. The food is quite ok and reasonably priced - it’s not the best tapas in Barcelona nor is it the best value. The food is more or less authentic but the environment lacks any character of this wonderful city. The hostess was not so welcoming but the waiters provided adequate service. Was it worth it ..... no ! Don’t queue, don’t wait ....... there are 100’s of other wonderful tapas restaurants in Barcelona !!! "
345,27-05-2019 ,5.0,"We were dining at this tapas restaurant and We were lucky because when we came it was fully booked but in 10 minutes we got a table for 3. However it is because we arrived at the restaurant a bit earlier than most people do. We came right before 18.00When we were done, the line was huge at around 20.00 waiting for the table.Food was great, we tasted various tapas, prawns skewers, biff and Pork skewers,White cheese deep fried on the stick, ( amazing!) artichoke omelet, I don’t remember everything. But I must tell you- this dinner made the first day of visiting Barcelona just wonderful. I recommend this place."
346,27-05-2019 ,4.0,"Whenever I come, there‘s a crowd of people at the entrance, waiting to be seated. This time were „lucky“ and „only“ had to wait for 20mins (we tried to get there at 16:15 though). I am not sure whether they take reservations or not, but for walk-in, be sure to register (name and number of ppl) at the reception. Lists are held separate for inside and outside seats. Usually there some free spots at the „tapas bar“. However, I prefer to get seated at a normal table.Must-orders: tortilla de patates (spanish omlette), baby squids (they didn‘t have them this time ), plate of tomato bread and plate of Iberian ham (bottom section of the menu). Also, desserts taste very good.As the restaurant is always full-house, service and kitchen are a little slow and not very friendly (they‘re ok, not rude, but a little smile wouldn‘t do bad)"
347,26-05-2019 ,5.0,"We ate at an outdoor table because it was quicker but if you can, eat inside at the beautiful tapas bar. We watched the people go by, and the very skilled wait staff handle the pedestrians and the people waiting for tables. Great sangria, perfectly done calamari."
348,24-05-2019 ,5.0,"We were 7 in the group and had to wait 90 minutes for a table. We almost left because of the long wait but glad that we stayed. Best tapas and sangria in Barcelona for sure! We had the beef with foie gras, and it was absolutely amazing! We also had the gambas and the octopus, which were divine. We had a pleasant experience that we had to come back two days after to eat the same set of food. We still had to wait for 45 minutes though.Try the bread pudding and the coconut flan for dessert. Kudos to Antonio, Michelle, and the rest of the Filipino crew for their impeccable service. "
349,24-05-2019 ,5.0,"We had been forewarned that the line would be long. We went at 6pm, expecting immediate seating as we know people in Barcelona don't eat their supper until 9pm.I was so wrong. There were people lining up inside and outside already. I gave them my name and was told to wait for half an hour. We agreed to share a table, so at the end we only had to wait 15 minutes. The restaurant is huge, so don't be scared away by the line, it has a pretty fast turnover.We loved every single dishes we ordered. The foie gras and beef tenderloin melted in my mouth. The octopus was very tender. The fried artichoke was flaky, crispy and tasteful. The bread pudding rounded up a perfect meal. We came out so so satisfied. Unfortunately , we found this place on our last day of our vacation. Otherwise we would have gone a second time."
350,23-05-2019 ,4.0,"First time i went here was literally ten years ago. i remembered the great tapas here, with the very nice bar and wondered whether this restaurant was still here. it was! and the food is still amazing! we were here a quarter to eight and had a short wait for a table. highly recommend this place!"
351,22-05-2019 ,4.0,"This is a busy place and you have to wait about 30/40 min but it’s alright.re are so many choices of dishes.Just take a shot and try as much as you can,the waiter can help you if you are not sure."
352,21-05-2019 ,5.0,"We ate here twice..... once for dinner, and back for lunch..... BUSY.... you may have to wait..... but worth it!! A fantastic variety of tapas!! Staff is VERY efficient, & attentative. We tried many different tapas.... This is an ideal place to experience a wide variety of Spanish tapas..... We will DEFINITELY return..... multiple times!!"
353,21-05-2019 ,5.0,If you wonder why people will wait in the rain to get in this place it's because how fantastic the food and service is. Keep trying and you'll enjoy some awesome tapas.
354,21-05-2019 ,4.0,The place is too crowdy and busy.The place is well known and famous.Full of people and waiting list.The food is delicious and the service if quick trying to serve the biggest number of people possible.
355,21-05-2019 ,5.0,Great variety. Very tasty. Good Cervesa. Just a little bit crowdy after shopping hours. When in Barcelona I go there again and again
356,21-05-2019 ,5.0,cerveceria catalana has great sangria and authentic tapas. the sirloin steak pincho is the absolute best. highly recommend!! they do not take reservations so expect to wait a little bit to get a table at dinner time. it is well worth the wait!
357,20-05-2019 ,4.0,"Very crowded at 21:00 when we arrived on Sunday. The food was good and the service was fast. Almost too fast. We started to feel that they were trying to achieve a fast turnover. To our surprise, the menu was exactly the same as that as Vinitus several blocks to the south. We generally preferred Vinitus for the better food delivery and service. The thing that really turned us off to this place was when the server presented the check and openly suggested adding a service charge of 10% to the bill. We have never experienced this behavior in Spain. From our experiences, tipping is discretionary. Generally, we leave something but four of us present at two tables found this behavior of the server unusual and unsavory. Changed the feel of the evening. "
358,19-05-2019 ,4.0,"This is the first time eating at this restaurant and the overall experience was very good! We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table! It was Sunday around 6:50 pm! The hostess was not very friendly! The food was very good, but not hot! The waiter was okay! "
359,19-05-2019 ,4.0,"Nice and bright restaurant. It was a big place but all the tables were full. We were lucky to get a table for 3 of us.We ordered foie with bread, paella, bacalao with honey and the fries with egg and chorizo. Food was nice and hot. Service was friendly. Wish we could try more but we were full."
360,17-05-2019 ,4.0,It was great food like the reviews said with a good variety and very reasonable prices but you have to wait since this place is popular. We were there at 4:30pm and we waited 20 minutes for a table. But it was worth the wait.
361,16-05-2019 ,5.0,Very nice restaurant with tasty food at affordable prices. Service is very good but besieged with people waiting for free table. You need to consider waiting at least 30 min before getting a table during lunch time. Reservations are not possible. You will be asked to leave after 45-60 min due to other people waiting for the table.
362,16-05-2019 ,5.0,"We managed to eat at “la Cerveceria Catalana” at our second attempt. This restaurant, in fact, became famous for the quality of its food and beer and it’s literally stormed by tourists and local people. Once you get there, you’re requested to give your name and you are informed of the expected waiting time. I must say that, despite the crowd and the queue, they really respected the time they had told us.As we had expected, our dinner was delicious and the service careful and quick.Prices were in line with the quality of the food."
363,15-05-2019 ,5.0,"I only get one thing when I come to this tapas restaurant. I order the Angry Eggs. The others in our party experienced more diverse tapas and everyone totally enjoyed everything! The only problem is that you have to find an ""off"" time or you have a long wait for a table. This is a very popular place."
364,15-05-2019 ,5.0,"If you don't mind waiting, you'll enjoy an incredible meal here. The environment is fun and the service is fast. We were shocked at the quality and variety of tapas they offer, yet their prices were ridiculous low, it's no wonder all the locals flock here. This may be the best quality meal we've had in Barcelona. Definitely recommending to friends and family visiting soon. This restaurant is definitely a Diamond In The Rough!"
365,15-05-2019 ,5.0,"Tried their beer and tapas, both were excellent. The service was fast and waiter was very polite. Would love to come back again. "
366,14-05-2019 ,5.0,Wonderful dining experience at this establishment! Very friendly staff and excellent tapas. The foie w/ beef was soo soo good and everything was fresh and delicious! Would only recommend for folks that don’t smoke to avoid sitting in the outside area as it was implicitly noted that we would eating next to diner smokers. Otherwise eating inside is definitely a better option! Overall would recommend and come back to this restaurant for the excellent food and service!
367,13-05-2019 ,5.0,"This restaurant was suggested by are hotel concierge and we were not disapointed! The restaurant was full and I know why! Fast and very good service, the tapas were excellent. Favorite restaurant of the whole trip!"
368,12-05-2019 ,3.0,"Nice buzz and good location. A lot of fresh food to choose from. However, everything is fried like in any other bar. Very unhealthy and if you are vegetarian or vegan, your choices are very limited (unless you define dinner as cheese and fries)."
369,11-05-2019 ,1.0,"1h waiting for bad service and bad food ! They litturaly throw the food ! And super expensive go what it is ! If you are looking for a very bad experience in Barcelona, you found the place !"
370,9-05-2019 ,3.0,We were recommended this restaurant by our shuttle driver so we thought it would be more local. When we arrived there were crowds of people waiting outside and inside was very busy but they all seemed to be tourists. We wanted to sit outside and did get a table quickly. When we ordered they didn't have 3 of the dishes so not eating meat we were very limited. The waiter suggested 6 dishes but at least one of the dishes we realised had not arrived. When I went to use the bathroom after we paid I saw that there was a much bigger range of dishes along the bar and was surprised the waiter hadn't told us this.The waiters were friendly and the few small dishes we had were nice enough but all in all we left hungry and disappointed. 
371,9-05-2019 ,5.0,All the food is tapas! Including dessert! The service is very fast. You order 2-3 plates at a time & more when those are done. The sangria is great too!
372,7-05-2019 ,5.0,"Our friend has recommended this place, but when we came, the place was crowded. We needed to wait arround half an hour to sit...and it was worth it.Very spetial place, very tasty food, differrent and unique way of preparing meals. It's worth of waiting...and worth of money.Enjoy!"
373,7-05-2019 ,5.0,"Great buzzing place, always full, but worth the wait, also always sit at the bar-looking at all the mouth watering tapas!! You will keep ordering one after another, get few cervesas and enjoy the atmosphere!!! "
374,7-05-2019 ,5.0,"They don’t take reservations, so expect a wait of 45 min on average. Absolutely worth the wait, popular spot and very crowded but tables were comfortable inside. Our waiter spoke minimal English and we spoke minimal Spanish/Catalan, but we managed and loved every single tapas we ordered - all absolutely delicious! This was by far my favorite meal in Barcelona during my stay. Try the foie tapas, it was a favorite - tho we had only seafood after that aside from an artichoke omelette and I would eat them all again. I ordered a gin tonic and they brought a bottle of Bombay Sapphire to the table with a small bottle of tonic water, and poured the gin into my glass until I indicated it was enough. Never had that done anywhere else but I appreciated the attentiveness of the servers. Great place! We were a group of 3 and ate till we were full, around 8-9 tapas dishes, and the bill came to about 95 Euros (including our drinks) which I found quite reasonable. Casual, great for a group or couple (we saw plenty of both), lively atmosphere, crowded especially up front by the host stand, and a must when you are in Barcelona."
375,6-05-2019 ,2.0,"To start, this establishment is part of the same family as Vinitus. The reason I'm giving them only four stars is not based on the food. It's a similar menu to Vinitus; however, the service isn't close to the attentive service that Vinitus gives you. Frankly, the food here is five stars... but when the waiters just come and literally ""drop"" my tapas on the table, doesn't make me a happy camper. I'm told by one waiter that ""this"" location is the No.1 favorite spot in all of Barcelona. Might be accurate, as over 1/2 of the menu was sold out for the evening... At Vinitus, I'm going to admit; you're pampered and treated as an honorable guest. Here, you're just a body eating... there's no warmth or happy fuzzy feelings...Our trip is almost over... after two visits to Vinitus, they might get a third. For this establishment, this will, unfortunately, be our last. I'm also not including it in my Barcelona list on Yelp.If you can't get into Vinitus but want a similar theme, cone here, but be prepared for lackluster service."
376,6-05-2019 ,2.0,"Went there because everybody said it was a great place for tapas, even though I knew it was a bit crowded and the waiting list was quite long. We were 2 and asked for a table inside. Waited about half an hour, which was not bad considering that the hostess said we would have to wait about 1h15min. Great! Well... not so much. The jug of sangria was fine, but we had issues with the food. We ordered the “pimientos padrón”, which everybody says is kinda sweet, but their was VERY BITTER, we tried two or three and then gave up. Also ordered a “tortilla”, and I have to said I had better ones homemade during my stay in Barcelona. “Crispy Cramembert”was good, as the “veal sirloin” montadito. But for me the biggest issue was with the “prawn skewer” montadito. It comes with 4 prawns if I’m not wrong, and the smaller one was not clean, it still had its digestive tract (which also includes prawn “poop”). It wasn’t suppose to happen in such a well known place, but I understand things go wrong sometimes, it’s ok. So I called the waiter and told him about the problem, but he simply said that it’s the way they eat it in Barcelona, and that I could take it off if I was feeling uncomfortable about eating it. Although he said it in a very polite way, I find it unacceptable that not only they serve it like that (which can occur) but furthermore, that they didn’t even apologised or bothered to take it away and change it for a clean one (as all the other prawns- cleaned)- they just told me to clean it by myself- the poop of the prawn. I lost my appetite. Food is average, I wouldn’t recommend the place."
377,6-05-2019 ,2.0,average food dirty glasses and plates quick service but the hostess was rude .wated at least 40 minutes to be seated near the kitchen that was smealy.the food was ok but not something worth going again
378,5-05-2019 ,5.0,I read about this place on trip advisor and it was near to our apt we rented. It was packed outside and inside waiting. The hostess said about 20 minutes for 2(pays to speak spanish) after ordering our wine at bar she called us in 5 minutes! Food and service first rate! Have to get cod baked with melted cheese unbelievable! Struck up conversations with patrons to our left and right. Truly a memorable experience.
379,5-05-2019 ,5.0,"Awesome tapas, so fresh and loved the sangria too!It’s worth the wait and the staff are welcoming and fast to get you to a table and bring you food and drinks!"
380,4-05-2019 ,5.0,"So happy to be back! Went the first night we arrived in Barcelona for dinner. 2 separate waiting lists. One for inside and one for outside. The wait for inside at about 9pm was 1hr 1/2 for 2 adults and 1 child. Outside wait was 30min. Of course we put our name on the list for outside.But may be worth it to put your name down for both. It was well worth the wait. Ordered a Sangria, ham croissant sandwiches, beef tenderloin, mini hamburgers were all delicious. I think anything you order will be delicious. Prices are affordable. It was so good we came again the following day for a early dinner. We got in right away. Highly recommend. Will be back next time I'm in Barca."
381,4-05-2019 ,5.0,We were recommended this restaurant by a hotel concierge in Barcelona. There’s no reservations so we just have to wait. We were told 45 minutes but managed to get in less than 40 minutes. The restaurant was packed but we managed to get our food and drinks in good time. Almost all the tapas dishes were good. I would definitely return and would recommend this to anyone going to Barcelona. 
382,1-05-2019 ,1.0,"I would really like to give less than one star, because the service that I have experienced is way below the quality level that a restaurant of this kind should aim at . we received a beef steak with half an hour delay. One order was canceled and another order was not available after we have been waiting for more than half an hour for that order. There was no supervisor available to To whom we could explain our situation…While walking out of the restaurant we were told that we were just asking too much, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone that I know."
383,1-05-2019 ,1.0,"This is the third time we try to get in but the place was very packed with 1h waiting list, mostly Japanese and American tourists. Since one cannot reserve, having been there already a couple of years ago, I personally advise to look for another place which are hundreds in Barcelons. "
384,30-04-2019 ,5.0,"We asked our taxi driver for recommendations for genuine Spanish tapas ... and he certainly gave us a great place to visit. You cannot reserve a table but we only waited about 15 minutes (originally told 30-45 minute wait). The place was buzzing and it had a great atmosphere. The staff were very good and spoke excellent English. The food was delicious and certainly one of the best we have ever tasted and the cost was extremely cheap compared to the terrible food we ate and paid for at a tapas bar on La Ramblas. Would definitely recommend the mixed salad, fried fishes, Spanish omelette and of course the Cava!"
385,30-04-2019 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant after seeing the great reviews online. They don’t take reservations and there was a queue - we waited for about 30mins in the queue before being seated, but it was definitely worth it. The tapas was great in terms of quality, variety and price. I am a vegetarian and there were quite a few options for me to choose from (which is usually not the case in a lot of restaurants in Spain). The atmosphere inside was lovely. I would definitely sit inside again, as outside on the street there are people smoking, so I found it much more enjoyable inside. Lovely food and good service. "
386,28-04-2019 ,5.0,This place was a recommendation from our friends and it did not disappoint. We were a group of 7 and we loved everything. The place is quite full so expect to wait as they don’t take reservations. Put your name on the list as soon as you get there and enjoy some drinks at the bar while you wait. For large groups they have a maximum of 2 hours once you’re seated which worked out for us. The service is good but very fast and a little hectic. That can make you feel pressured at times. There are usually at least two people taking care of your table sonfood arrives quickly and empty plates disappear fast too! Happy atmosphere throughout the place. We would return if ever in Barcelona again!
387,28-04-2019 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is my favorite place to enjoy tapas in Barcelona - great the whole day around, even for the typical local breakfast. Depending on the time during the day, be prepared to queue if you choose to visit the place in the evening. After eight pm you wait at least for half an hour for a table. Thus, some locals eat and drink here between three and seven pm. The great thing for a foreigner is you see at the bar a lot of the great food on offer, and you can point to your choice. The food is fresh and delicious. Some of the personnel do speak or at least understand English - knowing only three or four Catalan words I never encountered a language problem. Entering the bar you'd have right hand a selection of cold tapas and left-hand a choice of warm ones. Not displayed at the bar is the spectacular mini filet mignon w/ foie gras on the top, just the must.And last but not least, try them all. Many Spanish wines round it up - you'll be helped with the right choice, let them inspire you. You'll be delighted."
388,27-04-2019 ,5.0,"This restaurant was the best restaurant we went in Barcelona! We were there for 4 days and we went twice. The only problem is that there is a huge waiting list where usually you have to wait for about an hour, but we were lucky and got served earlier. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth the wait!! All the tapas we had were amazing, they tasted so fresh and authentic. The patatas bravas are just heaven, definitely recommend. I was also surprised by how cheap it was, we shared 5 big tapas, half a litre of sangria and a dessert for 40 euros. I can't wait to go again to this place when I'm back in Barcelona!!!"
389,27-04-2019 ,5.0,"We found this place accidentally, but having eaten there once we couldn't resist to keep coming back. Whatever you try is amazing - croissant con jabugo, tapa con croquet, arroz con bogavante, aceitunas, croissant con jabugo y mozzarella, pulpo, pan con tomato (the best we've ever tried and we tried a lot of them!), tapa con pera y queso azul, gambas - I could list much more! anything you try is mouthwatering.The only downside is a waiting time as they do not accept reservations. If you are lucky you may find a table at the bar which is as good as the restaurant table.A must try when you are in Barcelona!"
390,25-04-2019 ,5.0,Recommended by our local Gaudí tour guide for Catalonian food and it did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and although crowded during lunchtime we had comfortable seating and good service. English menu available. Highly recommended.
391,25-04-2019 ,3.0,It’s a bit of a tourist trap but the foods were quite good. They served Tapas The restaurant was huge but it’s packed. The ambiance was simple. The restaurant was big. It’s not cheap and the location was great. The services were professional.
392,23-04-2019 ,4.0,"Very yummy food, great customer experience,staff very friendly and fast food service. Great time.great atmosphere "
393,23-04-2019 ,3.0,"when I arrived there, already a lot of people waiting. I waited nearly 1 hour to get my table and tried to order some dish but a lot of dish sold out. after we ordered food, some food arrive on our table even not we ordered.you need prepare to go there and reserve table, then wait at least 30 mins."
394,23-04-2019 ,5.0,"We've been second time in this Tapas bar in Barcelona. Even you have to wait minimum half an hour for a table, it is deffinately worth the time. The kitchen is amazing, you have to taste the achovies and different type of sandwiches and the desserts such as bread with chcoco eis, olive oil, and sea salt. "
395,22-04-2019 ,5.0,Food was soo good! Everything was so amazing! I went there once when I visited balcelona 3 months ago and went back there again. The waiting time is Around 40 mins but well worth it.The only thing that I questioned about the restaurant was the old lady told us that we have to pay 10% service charge but it wasn’t in the invoice. I am not sure if it was their way to force us to pay tips as it wasn’t stated anyway. Pretty dodgy in my opinion
396,22-04-2019 ,5.0,Our Air BNB host recommended this restaurant and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed it so much we went twice. Great food and fast service ! Go to Cervecería !
397,20-04-2019 ,5.0,"The feel, the decor, the waiters and the food are all fantastic. Every tapas we had was superb and as we remembered. I fully recommend this as one of your nights even though you may have a wait for a table. Use the wait to have a red wine or some sangria."
398,16-04-2019 ,5.0,"A tapas place recommended by the hotel staff. Turned out to be fabulous, and, for Europe, an real value. We ate until we could eat no more, and with wine, dinner came to roughly fifty Euros."
399,16-04-2019 ,5.0,"We waited over an hour to get in the other night, but it was definitely worth the wait. Food and service was phenomenal! There was not one thing that I would not order again."
400,15-04-2019 ,5.0,"The hotel we were staying at recommended Cerveceria Catalana and we were so glad we took their recommendation as it was fabulous! We ate at the bar so we were delighted with the many plates of tapas that were on display, but the wait staff were amazing too! Ryan, Sherwin and Yan Carlos were great, very friendly and answered all my questions about what everything was! We ate so much food, had several drinks and even dessert and the bill was so small we didn’t even think it was right! But it was! I am definitely going back for more! Their tapas are to die for!"
401,15-04-2019 ,5.0,"Get there by 630pm if you do r want to wait 40 minutesBeef tenderloin. Is a mustPapas bravas, cooked peppers, ham and cheese and sangria and you are doneFried artichokes are goodShrimp in oil, garlic and pepper"
402,14-04-2019 ,4.0,"Many restaurants do outstanding things in Barcelona. This here is great in tapas, apparently in a new style. Very good ingredients, taste and quality. The restaurant is well recommend hence one need a bit of time to be seated. "
403,14-04-2019 ,5.0,"If you have not put Catalana on your must do list, do it now. The best tapas in Barcelona, the potatoes with egg and picante, the shrimp skewers and many more are out of this world excellent. The wait is hit and miss, but worth wating for. Staff is excellent, accommodating and professional. You'll see other reviews commenting on the amount of tourists, but hey, you are likley one too! GO, NOW!"
404,13-04-2019 ,5.0,Delicious and fun. Food is fresh and well seasoned. Restaurant is clean and comfortable. Ate there twice! Would have gone again but there was no time. We ate at the counter and the staff was helpful. Other diners were also good for suggestions.I tried grilled sardines upon recommendation and they were outstanding. Didn’t even like sardines before this. Be brave and have fun. You will not be disappointed.
405,13-04-2019 ,3.0,Not what is used to be - good Tapas but unfriendly staff and fried items were greasier than they should be. Full of Chinese taking photos or ordering from photos drinking jugs of Sangria.
406,13-04-2019 ,5.0,I eat here at least twice a month!! This is hands down one of the best tapas restaurants in barcelona and maybe the world! Everything is fresh!!! They are busy round the clock... i think they only close for 5 hours. If you love meat you must have “montadito de solomillo & mini hamburguesa “ !One of their signature dishes is “huevos cabreados” don’t leave without trying them! Their desert station makes one of the best “torrijas” i have ever tried!! The “montadito de camembert” melts in ur mouth. If u are in barcelona don’t leave without eating here! Tell them micah sent u!! Haha
407,13-04-2019 ,5.0,"Always busy as it's featured in guidebooks and on internet review sites but this is part of the ambiance. You'll be lucky to be seated right away but give your name and you rarely wait more than 30-40 minutes.Seats are dotted around the counter, which is great for selecting from the tapas in front of you. If seated at a table, you can still select in the same way, or peruse the menu. Hot and cold food available, all of which is of a really high standard.I've been many times in my visits to Barcelona over quite a number of years and it always maintains it's quality, cheerful vibe, great food and drinks. Don't miss it."
408,13-04-2019 ,5.0,Great food service kind of sloppy. Ideal for tapas style lunch. Wine list limited (it’s. a cerveseria). Value for money okz
409,8-04-2019 ,3.0,"Stopped in here on Sunday for lunch. Since we got there around noon, we were lucky enough to get seated right away. This place is a little more upscale, but all the food we ordered was very tasty and didn't felt the prices were moderate. Our server was a little short with us, which I couldn't understand since it was early and we had just sat down, but that was my only issue. Appreciated the bi-lingual menu. Enjoyed the sangria, along with the prawns, calamari, fritas, foie gras and sandwich. When we left the restaurant around 1:30 pm, there was a pretty long line outside the restaurant."
410,8-04-2019 ,5.0,"We came here on the first day while we’re in Barcelona. Not only there were lots of tourist but there are lots of locals too which mean the food must be good The taste was on point, the atmosphere was great and you MUST come here. Don’t forget to try other tapas restaurant though but you should drop by here once at least. Gracias!"
411,7-04-2019 ,5.0,This place was recommended by our hotel and it did not disappoint at all. It actually served the best tasting food I have had anywhere on the globe. You have to have the beef tenderloin with foie gras on toast....it literally melts in your mouth. Also had the octopus and asparagus and mushrooms....perfectly prepared. We’re going back tomorrow. Get there early as it is very popular 
412,6-04-2019 ,5.0,"The tapas was amazing here. The service was excellent and the food came out very quickly. Was decently priced and not at all expensive, think we shared about 7/8 plates and spent around €35. Only downside was that was sat outside and it can get quite noisy. Other than that could not recommend enough. "
413,3-04-2019 ,5.0,"Definitely visit it !The food was amazing!!Real Mediterranean flavors and nice prices. You will not be able to book a Table, you have to wait a little, but worth it!"
414,3-04-2019 ,2.0,"This restaurant is the definition of a tourist trap. Probably because it has 4.5 stars here with over 11,000 reviews. We're pretty sure they crank out the food ahead of time and just keep it under a heat lamp until someone orders it. It's very very average. The service was rushed and really gave the impression they didn't give a damn. We ordered the calamari, shrimp, sangria, steak - ugh - just so average and lukewarm. It's a mistake to go here especially when there are so many world-class restaurants in Barcelona. Don't have buyers remorse as we did."
415,2-04-2019 ,1.0,"After all the amazing reviews and after having tasted some amazing food in Barcelona, I was really excited to eat here. My first impression was immediately bad. The host is rude and seems rushed to get people in and out as fast as he can. He took our order and it arrived very fast, too quickly to be fresh. After tasting the first dish, potatoes and aioli,I was incredibly let down. It was saturated in oil, mushy - not crispy and all, cold, and tasted only of oil. I thought maybe it was just this specific dish but when I got the other plates I understood it was the food in general. NONE of the hot tapas I ordered were hot, they were all cold. All of them were drenched in oil in an attempt to fry them but none of them were crispy. I am actually physically sick right now from the food I ate because of how much oil was on them. The bread with tomato was cold, soggy, and you could tell it had been sitting out for awhile. We weren’t asked once how the food was, and weren’t even told thank you when we checked out. During the whole meal I didn’t see the waiter except when he silently put my food on the table. When we asked for the ticket he swiped the card and said “Okay, bye bye.” I would not eat here again, and definitely would not recommend it to anyone else!!! There are SO many better restaurants with better service, no wait times, and WAY better food. Don’t waste your time here!"
416,2-04-2019 ,4.0,"Came at 7:30PM and the place was packed. We put our name down and waited about 40min. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, this Brie coated with nuts on a skewer, steak with foie, razor clams, cod fish with honey aioli, and seafood on a skewer. My favorite was the cod fish but all the other dishes were good too"
417,2-04-2019 ,5.0,"My sister went to this place 3 times back in 2009 and was hopeful that it would still be open and serving wonderful food for my visit. Well, I went there 2 times and was not disappointed either time. The tapas were were wonderfully prepared and the wait staff were efficient and polite since there were long lines. We loved everything that we ordered so I don't believe you can go wrong with your selections."
418,1-04-2019 ,5.0,"Good place for Tapas and Wine, the restaurant is big but also very busy, I recommend reservation in advance. It is kids friendly, the prices are good. They have good variety of local beer as well"
419,1-04-2019 ,5.0,"We were there in early March, fantastic. The food was well priced and service was excellent. When we return in October we will be going back."
420,31-03-2019 ,5.0,Not to be missed!!! We ordered a handful of tapas dishes and loved every one of them!! The food was so flavorful and service was great - try the calamari and Camembert cheese! Would definitely return when in Barcelona. 
421,31-03-2019 ,1.0,"Went to Cerveceria Catalana on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed as usual. Food was lacklustre and was not flavourful as tapas should be, most was rather bland. The oil they used to toss mushrooms in lacked flavour and felt like you were basically eating just oily parsley. The patatas bravas were not great and they were very stingy with their aioli. The serving of the food also stopped halfway for about 20 minutes and we asked on our order to be checked, only to be responded with 2 waiters shouting at each other over the table in Spanish, which we personally felt could be handled with a little more tact. They got very huffy with us and seemed annoyed that we asked for our order to be checked eventhough we only asked once and it was after waiting for a while and seeing that the next few tables were served already. The waiters were also hounding the table and kept trying to take plates off the table eventhough we were still eating, which made us feel terrible unwelcomed, as if they were in a hurry for us to get out of there. We understand that it's fine to take plates away when the customers are finished, but we were not done eating and they did not ask first before trying to take it away. Overall, this place is so overrated and the food was not worth the wait or the price. The restaurant gets away with so much just because they are famous. Perhaps they should remember that they would be nothing without their customers, so service should be looked into. Will not be returning."
422,31-03-2019 ,3.0,"This was one of the places recommended by two different people we know. We have been in Spain a week and this by far was the most disappointing meal so far. It was busy when we got there, but after 20 minutes or so the queue was out the door. The tip we should have seen was most of the people waiting were tourist. Now the menu was mainly seafood which is what we craved but the dishes delivered lacked any flair. For me it was more of a cafeteria style restaurant. We had the fried artichokes which were sliced very thin and fried, and they had no flavour. The shrimp in garlic sauce was not really garlicky but the shrimp were good. The cod was okay, we had a similar dish the night before that was fantastic. This was a little on the chewy side, not very flakey. The only good was the cost. For 5 Tapas and a bottle of wine it was 40 euros. "
423,30-03-2019 ,5.0,"Everything was so flavoursome and well-prepared. The seafood as incredibly fresh, and flavours were very rich. Incredible value too at just €22 for 3 dishes, a coffee and Crema Catalana. Would highly recommend"
424,30-03-2019 ,5.0,"What a fantastic place. The food was fantastic and fresh, this is truly a hidden gem.If you like tapas it’s a Mecca of gorgeous, fresh and tasty food.Thoroughly recommend this place. Don't be out of by the queue and register your name they may say come back in 30mins but it is truly worth it."
425,29-03-2019 ,2.0,"Food was OK, but service was bad, especially our server MICHELLE who has an attitude problem, she didn’t bother explaining the items and gave us the attitude, we didn’t take long to order and haven’t have a good chance to finish reading the menu which is quite long. We felt being rushed into ordering and our waitress was very impatient taking our order, didn’t utter a word the whole time, just took our order and shoved us the check, think twice before walking in!"
426,29-03-2019 ,5.0,"We came to this part of Barcelona to have a look at Casa Batllo and Casa Mila. This restaurant was near by and had good reviews so we decided to give it a try! We came at ~4pm. We thought we would have to wait for a table based on the other reviews, but they were able to seat us immediately. Fair warning though: it got busier and busier the later it got. By the time we left around ~5:30pm, there were people waiting outside the restaurant to be seated. We were not sure what to get so we started by ordering the Assorted Tapas. This came with four shrimp, fried anchovy chunks, 8-9 clams, a small cup of blistered peppers and four chicken and ham croquettes. I know a few other reviews said the restaurant's tapas were not true ""tapas"". I cannot comment on this for I am a tourist from California, but I can say these small dishes were delicious! The seafood was incredibly fresh and did not taste fishy at all (except for the anchovies which always have a little bit of a fishy flavor). I don't even like anchovies, but I ate these ones! All the flavors were subtle, but this just meant you were able to enjoy the main ingredient of each small plate. The croquettes were, of course, delicious as well, but who does not like deep fried balls of delight! They held their shape when picked up and melted in your mouth when you took a bite! Encouraged by our Assorted Tapas, we also ordered a portion for each of us of the Fillet with the Foie Gras Sauce and the Lobster on the Shrimp Toast. Please do not leave here without trying these! I will start with the Fillet with the Foie Gras Sauce. The fillet came stacked on a piece of bread with a crunchy crust and smeared with a thin layer of tomato and topped with a mushroom, foie gras sauce and some sort of sweet red sauce. We suspect the sweet red sauce was raspberry sauce, but it also could have been strawberry or something similar. All the flavors went together perfectly. We all gave an audible ""Mmmmm"" sound when we took our first bites. The Lobster on Shrimp Toast was equally delicious! The lobster was served on what looked like half a small long bread roll with what I assumed was an aioli. The lobster was soft and buttery. I like the juxtaposition of texture with the crunchy bread and soft lobster. To round it all out, our waiter was amazing! He was helpful in answering some of our questions about the menu and checked to make sure our friend was happy with the temperature she had requested for her meat. This was definitely one of our favorite meals while in Barcelona for the week."
427,28-03-2019 ,5.0,Best restaurant we had in Barcelona and heading back again before we leave. Sangria great proportion. Fresh shrimps and cod fish which my kid didn't reject at all. Lobster paella and everything was good.
428,26-03-2019 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by the hotel staff and my own research. It’s a popular place for both locals and tourists. Twice we went (yes, it was that good), the place was packed inside and out. The waiters were friendly and efficient. The restaurant has some staple dishes but it does change everyday so don’t expect to order the same thing. Everything we ordered was delicious and we wished we could’ve ordered more. I thought everything was reasonably priced (CA standard). Just go if you’re visiting Casa Milà or Casa Batlló. "
429,26-03-2019 ,4.0,Festive place for tapas with a pretty big menu with options for everyone. We had 8 people in our party and were given a 45 minute wait time. We were seated almost exactly st 45 minutes.
430,26-03-2019 ,4.0,"All the above restaurants belong to the same owners! No wonder they all have identical menus! They are all good.Like the Bacalau, calamari, grilled cuttlefish and sauteed mushrooms. Muy delicioso!!!"
431,25-03-2019 ,5.0,"Our first stop during our visit to Barcelona. Went during lunch time and waited about 30 minutes, but the food was worth the wait. Very reasonably priced as well."
432,23-03-2019 ,5.0,Very traditional Catalan atmosphere and great tapas....... very professional and friendly staff. we had a great lunch
433,22-03-2019 ,4.0,"I think that 50% of their customers were tourists. We were lucky to avoid the long waiting getting a table. Food quality was high. Decoration was also modern.Staffs spoke good English and tourist friendly. Prices were a bit high.If you are in town, it is worthwhile to try it once."
434,22-03-2019 ,5.0,"We visited Cerveceria Catalana last week at lunch time. We had to wait 10 mins for a table but it would have been a lot longer had we arrived any later. You can tell by the crowds that the food must be good. The menu is really unusual and well worth the wait! The food is presented beautifully. We had a couple of the daily specials, the famous 'cabregos eggs style' and the beef tenderloin. It was all amazing! The staff couldn't do enough and the food came quickly!"
435,20-03-2019 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is clearly one of the ""in"" restaurnats in Barcelona. We went on a Tuesday evening at 8:30 pm and it was packed, with a long waiting line (they don't take reservations). Luckily we were there with a Spanish-speaking friend, and were able to get a table in about 45 minutes. we sat at one of the tapas bars in the front of the restaurant while waiting for our table and had drinks - the tapas are beautifully displayed. The food was excellent and the staff was very pleasant. If you want to be part of a ""scene"" and have great food, this is the place to go."
436,19-03-2019 ,4.0,"We came at night about 9pm and they informed us to have to wait (we can go and come back) about 1h30 to be able to sit. There’s a long queue waiting for their turn to sit, and the place is very noisy/ crowded, but the tapas are delicious. So I think it’s better to come early before 8pm if you want to enjoy this place..."
437,19-03-2019 ,5.0,"Unpretentious, this place could easily be missed by a passerby, save for the line that can build as the evening waxes, However, that passerby would be missing an incredible experience dining on authentic Spanish tapas.The restaurant might not look large from outside but it's somewhat cavernous. Complimenting the spaciousness of the dining area is a menu that includes all kinds of meats and other small plates. Though few of the individual plates are all that expensive, just be careful of the tab. A visit doesn't have to break the bank but, trust me, it's possible to get carried away."
438,19-03-2019 ,4.0,"This place is recommended in every single Barcelona related travel blog/ guide, and I do get why. The place itself is lively, inviting and yes, full of people. Some say it is a place for tourist -it probably is, but for locals too. It serves wonderful food that certainly does taste authentic with a great service. Waiters said the best time to dine here is between 18 - 20 and so avoid the queuing and get early dinner as well as be able to taste the ""tapas del dia"" -a selection of tapas that the chefs recommend/prepared for this particular day-. The thing about the service is, the staff know what they are doing and so they are confortable serving you as if they've been doing it for years, thats how familiar and casual de mood here is -as a customer I do appreciate that-. special mention on the duck breast ""montadito"" with caramelised pear and foie gras as well as the steak and foie gras ""montadito"", wow!, so exquisite and cooked to perfection. big shout out to the chefs !. On the down side, sangria was rather disappointing and wines were average. overall, wonderful experience!. would definitely be back."
439,19-03-2019 ,5.0,"Found this restaurant from previous reviews. We got in quickly by going before 6.30pm. Food was delicious, plentiful and quite reasonable. Busy, busy place but worth going to!"
440,19-03-2019 ,4.0,"If you managed to get a table in this famous temple of Spanish food you know what I mean. Best tapas ever, traditional and modern. With a strong Catalan touch which will make your gastronomic experience even deeper. Be aware that the place does not take reservations, so you need to get there, gove them your name and be patient. This and the price slightly over the average are the only reasons of 4 out of 5 stars."
441,19-03-2019 ,5.0,"We spent a lot of time researching restaurants for tapas in our neighborhood before arriving in Barcelona. This is our absolute favorite so far. They don’t take reservations and there was a sizable waitlist but it is worth the wait. Luckily when we went, two seats at the bar opened up. Basically we spent the evening pointing to tapas and trying them. Everything we had was excellent. Especially the beef tenderloin and the sardines/anchovies. The best part, after eating for 2 hours and drinking a pitcher of sangria our bill cane in for under €38 for two people! We loved it so much we went back the next night! Still a chance we make it back again before we head home. "
442,19-03-2019 ,4.0,The tapas were excellent. We were able to get a table as soon as we arrived but it was very crowded. No reservations. The location is good. Right behind our hotel on Passeig de Gràcia. A very casual atmosphere and a very popular restaurant. Very good prices. We had several tapas and a bottle of very good wine fir under 50 euros.
443,18-03-2019 ,5.0,The atmosphere of this restaurant is very friendly and booming. Very kind and helpful servers- they were very patient with us and recommended a few of their favorite plates. The food was delicous and full of flavor. We enjoyed a traditional tapas meal-we shared the Iberian loin with foie and flauntas with pork loin and cheese. For dessert we enjoyed the churros and the best bread pudding I have ever had. Probably one of my favorite desserts. Don’t forget to try their Sangria! It was very reasonably priced. I’m excited to come back. 
444,17-03-2019 ,4.0,We were 6 men enjoying really good Spanish food. It helped a lot to be accompanied by a guest that spoke Spanish.We got good recommendations; the food was really good. We har a few bottles of wine some beers to accompany the food and surprisingly the bill was less than 30 Euros for each of us.....One thing; the restaurant manager was to eager to throw us out when we had paid. That was not very elegant!
445,17-03-2019 ,5.0,"Very good trendy restaurant!! Excellent food -tapas very good presentation! Good quality! Good service, polite stuffDon’t miss it!!"
446,14-03-2019 ,5.0,Great food! Fantastic ambience!Ruel at the bar is super friendly and give great recommendations!I am out of word...
447,14-03-2019 ,5.0,"The place is very pleasant with very professional and polite service. They have a variety of tapas- cold as well as hot with all kind of combinations ( anchovies and eggplants, salmon and asparagus and more). You should be lucky not to wait on line for a long time"
448,13-03-2019 ,3.0,"I m eating in this restaurant for almost 7 years. However, quality was decreasing everytime. Still if u r new in the town or have friends to show around, it is one of the decent tapas restaurant/bar which open all day. Don’t surprise with long cue and waiting list because they don’t accept reservations. I recommend los huevos cabreaos which u can’t find in ciudad comdal;)"
449,12-03-2019 ,5.0,If you go in the evening be prepared to wait for a table ( we went at 10.30pm and the wait time was 45min) but trust me it’s worth the wait.The tapas was top class and was the best meal I had on my weekend trip - I highly recommend this place. 
450,11-03-2019 ,4.0,We skipped lunch so we needed an early dinner at 5:30. Not a lot of places open so we tried this place. They were busy at that time which was surprising. Felt a little rushed to order. We probably tried 8 to 10 different tapas. They were all good and no one had any complaints. A few of the dishes were delayed coming out. Ordered a liter of sangria and we enjoyed it. If I wanted tapas I would go back again!
451,10-03-2019 ,5.0,"Had one of the older servers who made it seem like a chore to place our orders but the food was so dam good and the place is so much fun that it didn’t even matter!I did notice a lot of the other waiters being more friendly and accommodating, so I think we just got the old grumpy guy.That aside, the place is really fun, the tapas are the best we’ve had anywhere and the menu is really outstanding.Our favorites were the beef filet, the potato tortilla omelet and the mushrooms with asparagus.We’ve been here twice already! "
452,10-03-2019 ,5.0,"The best tapas in BCN in Cerveseria CatalanaWe loved everything about this place!!! When we receiving a visit from Costa Rica, my country, we go to Cerveseria Catalana. My favourite plate was Camembert Crujiente, was a piece of camembert with chopped nuts and berry jelly, I love it. One of our favourite dishes that we like most Huevos cabreados, a chips of potatoes with fried eggs.For dessert, I prefer the torrija because I like hot dessert and the combination of bread with cream are delicious."
453,9-03-2019 ,4.0,"Beef tenderloin + foie. If you only order one thing here, let it be that. It's a bit decadent, but totally worth every bite. Served like a pintxo, it comes on top of a small slice of bread, so you feel a little less gluttonous. Another good one is the gambas al ajillo. The shrimp is nice and plump. We also ordered a tapas sampler, which comes with more shrimp (seems like it was flash-fried, and you have to peel it yourself), clams, shisito peppers, croquettes, and calamari. The only thing noteworthy from that platter was probably the clams. Everything else was kind of meh. The calamari was pretty bland.For dessert, we had the Catalan Creme, which is creme brulee and the mini ice cream sandwiches. The Catalan Creme was great - not too sweet. But the ice cream sandwiches were even better. It was these bite-sized cubes of vanilla ice cream, sandwiched between two thin, crispy slices of wafers. It was the perfect end to the meal. So make that two things. If you only order two things here, let it be the beef + foie and the ice cream sandwiches. Trust me, you won't regret it."
454,8-03-2019 ,5.0,"We loved everything about this place- The Food was scrumptious!! The bacalao and the tenderloin with foie gras is on the top of our favorite, must not pass up, list!! We enjoyed both of these tapas, along with the asparagus and mushrooms, ""patatas bravas"" and the ""Gambas"" and all were just over the top delicious! The Service was extremely attentive and the sangria hit the spot perfectly!!!! The only thing to note is that the first night, we went there around 8pm which entailed about a 30 minute wait, the second night(Yes it was that good that we returned for a second time), we got there around 6pm and were sat immediately. "
455,8-03-2019 ,5.0,I have to say this restaurant was fantastic- the way the food is displayed and cooked is excellent. The establishment was clean and inviting. The staff were friendly and welcoming. The food was the best that I ate in Barcelona. The flavours and aromas where amazing. Just a taste explosion. Well done to the staff and keep doing what you do best 
456,3-03-2019 ,4.0,"This is a VERY popular place and for good reason. The tapas selection is huge. We had a range of dishes and they were delicious (mini burger, fillet steak, breaded Camembert, calamares, croquettes) as was the sangria. Not an inexpensive meal but worth the wait."
457,2-03-2019 ,4.0,There is always a queue at this place but definitely worth queuing up for. The tapas selections are great and more importantly taste great. 
458,1-03-2019 ,4.0,"Are here late afternoon, after travelling all day we didn’t really want too much to eat so it was good to sit at stools and just select as we went. Had a glass of house red - delicious!"
459,28-02-2019 ,4.0,"We waited 20 minutes for a table and it was surely worth the wait. The food was so good, please try ""Huevos cabreados"", a mix of eggs, French fries and aioli. The service could be better. I really recommend this place, a must to visit."
460,26-02-2019 ,5.0,We have visited this restaurant so many times whilst in Barcelona and one of our main reasons for returning to this wonderful city year in year out. Whether you squeeze in at the bar or wait an hour for a table it’s so worth it! True Barca experience with amazing fresh food and lovely Spanish sparkling wine (€16 a bottle) to wash it down with . . . Perfect!
461,26-02-2019 ,5.0,"This is great place for Tapas. If you come in the evening, plan for a long wait time Goya table , can take an hour to get one. It looks like tourists place so you will have English speaking staff and menu. Very good alternative for the famous Ciodad AvondaleExpect to pay around 40-50€ per person "
462,26-02-2019 ,5.0,"Amazing little place. Yes, because of it beeing an amazing place it also attracts A LOT of tourists but the food is great. Be there early or just wait/eat at the bar. Best experieced during the slower winter months."
463,24-02-2019 ,5.0,We took many dishes and they were all great. Was very crowded but it’s a really big place so don’t lose hope while you are waiting.
464,23-02-2019 ,5.0,This was our favourite place to eat. It is casual but elegant and extremely good value for money. It’s not somewhere you necessarily go for a special evening meal but it’s fantastic for amazing food and a lively atmosphere.
465,21-02-2019 ,5.0,"This is a very popular place and when I went I understood why. It is focused on tapas and rations. Everything I tried I really liked, especially the Camembert cheese palette. The torrija is also exquisite! Many options of desserts too! The restaurant is the perfect place to have a good time with friends, you will listen to laughter all over and in general it is a pre-party atmosphere or to visit it before a soccer game. They have formal tables and you can also sit at the bar and choose your own tapas. The waiters are very attentive, although naturally they are always in a hurry because the number of people who arrive is innumerable. At noon, you usually find a table immediately, but at night you must have a little more patience. Prices per tapas are between $3 and $5, depending on the type. The most expensive are those of seafood or beef. Desserts $3.25. If you go to Barcelona, this is a must visit! Highly recommended!"
466,19-02-2019 ,4.0,We enjoyed our meal in this very busy restaurant. The short wait is worth it. The queuing is very well managed. A good range of dishes. The staff are helpful and friendly and make good suggestions. Good value for money.
467,18-02-2019 ,4.0,Highly recommended place for tapas. Try to go before 6pm. Large crowds from 8pm onwards. Closes at 1am. Fast service. Tenderloin beef with foie gras is highly recommended.
468,17-02-2019 ,5.0,"I often revisit this restaurant during my infrequent trips to Barcelona and still find it great value. It's always busy and we had to wait 20m for a table. However it was worth the wait and enjoyed a range of tapas; especially loved the jamon, the razor clams and the gambas. Will be back"
469,13-02-2019 ,5.0,"The crowd lined up to get in - but it moves fast - there is loads of seating round the back and the sides, so we got set up quickly. And the food is a marvel.It looks delectable as you see the plates go by, but it arrives fast, fresh and luscious. A wonderful tapas experience. We savoured it, ordered more wine and talked about when we could visit again before heading home."
470,13-02-2019 ,5.0,"Though it's not a cheap place, it's not expensive at all, especially taking into account the quality of the food. You can eat pleanty of small dishes with typical tapas, seafood, meat... I recommend the brocheta de langostinos and the medallones con foie. The desserts are small and cheap, so you can enjoy them even if you have eaten a lot before."
471,5-02-2019 ,1.0,"It was one of our favorite restaurants in Barcelona, but now we are totally disappointed. If even one year ago you could have here top quality hamon, so now they provide low level ham... And they want 18 euro for one plate, i could buy the same one in the nearest shop for 2 euro. I uderstand, this restaurant is always full, ao no need to worry about reputation, but you loose your Name fast... "
472,4-02-2019 ,1.0,I visited this restaurant on my first day in Barcelona. I saw the review on tripadivsor and saw it was near my hotel so I decided to go there for dinner.I entered the restaurant and it was full. We got a table quite quick. We ordered a few tapas plates however none of the plates had flavour. The prawns tasted strange. Every plate I order tasted like they forgot to add salt and pepper. I decided to cancel my final plate as I was completely dissapointed by the previous 4 plates. I think this tapas restaurant is a tourist trap for people who are unaware of what authentic tapas taste like.
473,4-02-2019 ,5.0,"This is truly a hidden gem on the streets of Barcelona. We were recommended here and really weren't disappointed! The food was excellent, we chose a selection of tapas, and the service was second to none. It's a very popular place so I'd try and get there early as after we left the queues were out the door and down the street! A much needed visit for those in Barcelona"
474,4-02-2019 ,4.0,"Huge variety of pinchos and other delicious local dishes plus spanish wines and beers. After 8 pm it is always crowded, so you have to wait for a table (no more than 30min), but it's worth it."
475,4-02-2019 ,4.0,"This place is right across the street from the Hilton Curio Alexandria. Place is really busy in the evenings. I walked over, talked to the hostess, got on the list and went back to the hotel. During peak times, this place will be 35-1hr wait time.Food was really good. Best thing I had was the Huevos Rotas.. Seemed like everyone in the place was ordering it. Dont know if I would sit around waiting for an hour to eat here, but if you have other things you can fill the hour with and come back... I'd definitely do so. there is a lot of shopping and things to do on the street this sits on."
476,3-02-2019 ,5.0,"Whether it’s your first time in Barcelona or your 30 th once you step in you are not going to stop eating their Always sit on the bar, it takes about 30 minutes waiting but it’s the best site to be in and enjoy local Spanish people and tourists having a great tapas , pinchos, sea food and many more "
477,27-01-2019 ,5.0,restaurant has had renovated and there are more sitting tables inside. The tapas were all amazing and the waiters were all attentive ....
478,26-01-2019 ,5.0,One of the best tapas bars in Barcelona. The place is full of gues all day long Reservation recomended
479,25-01-2019 ,5.0,We had dinner tonight and enjoyed the food very much the service was excellent and the price was very good.

481,22-01-2019 ,5.0,"Found this place on Trip Advisor , after reading the reviews we gave it a go. So pleased we did ,what a great place, after a 30min wait as it was so busy we were seated. We loved the atmosphere straight away, it felt warm , welcoming , and it just felt good.We found the staff to be very attentive. The service was excellent.The food even better.All dishes were very well presented and tasted fantastic.Whatever your taste you will find plenty to eat.We have no problem recommending this restaurant, you will not be disappointed."
482,20-01-2019 ,5.0,"Best place to tapas, sangria and beers in Barcelona!! Everything very delicious, in special de cod with aioli and honey, mini hamburgers and beef fillet montaditos. All Yummy"
483,19-01-2019 ,4.0,"Talk about a restaurant that just does not stop, the tapas are good and the service is as good as it can be , this place is extremely busy all the time.Great sit down area outside and the food is tasty, gives you a good experience for first time tapas, i do believe that there are more refined tapas places but for a first visit to Barcelona , worth trying and using as a barometer for other tapas places in Barce. The location is so close to the main drag that it just pulls you in."
484,19-01-2019 ,4.0,"recommended by the b & b (where i was staying) proprietor i am really glad i took her advice and had dinner at Cerveceria Catalana. The food was excellent not 1 food item could be faulted, service impeccable and environment was busy but not suffocating so."
485,17-01-2019 ,5.0,"We found the restaurant in four square : we waited 45 min : everyone wants to eat there :Excellent food , a lot of varieties , very good service , not expensive (90€ for 4 people with wine !)Clean and nice place !I recommend !!!"
486,16-01-2019 ,5.0,"Usually very busy but we arrived during a late afternoon lull. We shared 4 tapas and 4 toasted breads with toppings, a bottle of Cava and water. The cod with tomato and honey was very good as were the padron peppers, gambas and patata bravas. Tapas sized puddings were also excellent as were the coffees. Service was brisk, friendly and efficient. We liked the food so much that we returned two days later. Highly recommend."
487,15-01-2019 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is ´El Clasico¨:-) 25years I have been coming to heere. Food quality has never changed. Few years ago when they have changed the decoration making more modern I was worried food was going to change. But, hasn't! Over the years I have met the staff and hardly has changed many of them. I respect to their pirincaples of runing the place, even got so crowded with tourist and locals still is the best in town...Best time to go before lunch time starts around 12:30 sitting at the corner of the bar and ordering all the fresh food of the day...So quiter and fresher and no waiting and really truely enjoy!"
488,15-01-2019 ,5.0,"If you want to enjoy a caylunya foods by reasonable price, I recommend to visit here. It is 30 euro per person including a drink and iva.But if you don’t want to wait to eat, you had better to select other restaurants. You must wait 30 min. at season off and 1 or 2 hours at high season.Of course you can wait for preparing your table while drinking and eating some tapas at the bar counter, if there are some space."
489,12-01-2019 ,1.0,Neither the floor personnel not the ones in the kitchen were Spanish. This was very much translated into the flavor of the food . I was very disappointed .
490,12-01-2019 ,5.0,"We was there today ,best place for tapas in Barcelona City town.Definitely I recommend.Delicious tapas."
491,12-01-2019 ,4.0,"Love this place for the quality of food but it’s very hard to find a quiet moment. If you are looking for a quick bite, it’s a must try while it’s not the right place if you want to spend some time in a relaxed atmosphere.Tapas menu is very reach, special mention for cangrejo salad."
492,10-01-2019 ,2.0,Food was average. Felt the staff were rushing us and was no real customer service. Wouldn’t rush back. 
493,9-01-2019 ,5.0,The staff are helpful. They introduced their famous dishes to us! All the food they recommended us are excellent! The prawn tapas really a must try items!
494,6-01-2019 ,4.0,"Great place for some Spanish tapas, great vibe and atmosphere. Service was great however waiter was pushy on trying to sell the whole time."
495,6-01-2019 ,3.0,"There’s a long line starting from the street and the place has a lot of recommendations. The specials menu is only available in Spanish; not English. Food is alright, but nothing special. "
496,6-01-2019 ,5.0,"This is a genuine tapas place, so many flavors and interesting combinations. a real treat. Definitely a must for anyone interested in experiencing tapas at its full glory."
497,6-01-2019 ,5.0,"The omelets, the baked Camembert, are to die for.While other restaurants sit less than half full, this great spot is bustling with the locals who know.Super friendly service too. Try to sit at the counter."
498,5-01-2019 ,5.0,Following our Tapas tour we went up from the Condal Tapas bar all the way up of Rambla Catalunya nice boulevard till the cross of Mallorca Street and than just almost on the corner on our right we found the well know Cerverceria Catalana.So crowded that we could not enter but we found a way after few minutes. Success is a must and this place is THE for tapas. The best way is to try to get a table in as staying at the counters is almost impossible but it is worth to be patient. If you are in hurry forget about.It is not about service it is about the atmosphere and the non stop reposition of all type of tapas at the counter. No need to describe what they have as everything is good and at time you don't know were to start. If you are smart which for sure you are try to go there out of peak hours and your stomach will be highly demanding as if not you may just have to move somewhere else not being able to keep him waiting.

500,2-01-2019 ,5.0,"For sure one of the best tapas places in Barcelona. Yes you need to wait for at least 20-30 minutes if you will catch luck you can have a shorter wait time.Just order a bunch of different tapas and couple salads, and enjoy your evening with a tons of different beers or cava it’s up to you.I would visit this place couple more times that’s for sure."
501,1-01-2019 ,5.0,"We went twice during our trip to Barcelona. We ate at the tapas bar both times at the suggestion of one of the chefs. It was crowded and there was a wait so we decided that would be best. It was so fun!! The food was delicious and prices were very reasonable. We recommend the fries with the egg cracked on top - definitely different, but SO delicious!"
502,1-01-2019 ,5.0,We came here 3 times in 4 days. It didn’t disappoint us at all. Every dish is so good. Please go earlier to avoid the queue during peak hours. Our favourite is the foei grad with steak 
503,31-12-2018 ,4.0,"This is the place you’re looking for if you enjoy high class tapas. It’s obviously an expensive place, however, I believe the prices to be decent due to the location, it’s fame, and quality.I definitely recommend this place! Definitely the place to go to for a family get together.One thing I must highlight, is that despite the presence of a lot of people, they manage to keep each table attended without being pressurised.If you are planing on going there for a meal or simply drinks with a significantly large party, it is more than recommended to make a reservation in which you state weather you’ll be eating or simply having drinks, in order to not occupy space unnecessarily at this restaurant, since it tends to be packed! If you don’t have a reservation and your party is, as I described previously, significantly large, then don’t expect to be seated as soon as you turn up. If you are just a few people, (1-4) you can expect to be seated depending on the day and timing. Nevertheless, it is always better to be safe than sorry, furthermore, it is recommended to always make a reservation; cancellations can always be performed when necessary!Please Note:Nevertheless, there isn’t much they have to offer for vegetarians."
504,30-12-2018 ,4.0,Very crowded but they had a nice variety of good and tasty tapas. Service was OK. This place is very centrally located not far away from Passeig de Gràcia. So if to crowded there are plenty of other nice tapas place to go to. 
505,30-12-2018 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is unmissable!!!The food was really amazing!! The place was a little bit crowded, but it worthed the wait.I went if my family ( brother, mother and father) and we had a lot of fun. A lot of young people! Great place to go with friends!"
506,28-12-2018 ,4.0,"Came as a family of 5 on a Friday night at 6.15pm and the place was already heaving. Waited in queue to give our name and when our turn came, someone tried to cut in front of us but was told firmly by the waitress to join the end of the line- thumbs up to that. All in all it was a 45 minute wait for a table. Service was quick and food was good, foie and steak on bread and the tuna were the highlights. Prices were extremely reasonable- tapas, dessert, water and sangria for 5 adults came to 113 euros. 4 stars because there wasn’t an English version of tapas of the day menu, otherwise excellent!"
507,25-12-2018 ,5.0,"Loved it, delicious food, staff is really nice (mostly).We were at hotel Mosaic which is across the street, and after eating there the first evening we simply came back the two other evenings because it was so good.We ate only Tapas, sitting at the bar. For two people the bar is great, not a long wait, sometimes none even when restaurant is full. Ask the waiters at the bar to keep an eye out for places that are freeing up.The Tapas menu has many specials that change daily and are great! Sitting at the bar you can point to what you want and ask questions about the food whenever you want.Solomillo with Foei was to die for. Sooo good. Champiion a la plancha, simple and yummy. A special tart with cherry tomatoes, pears and blue cheese - also great.Creme Catalan for desert - a small serving for 2.80 Euro. Very good!The waiters at the long bar on the right side were extra nice and very helpful with recommendations and explanations.The one waiter we saw on the short left side bar was not so nice - kind of impatient."
508,24-12-2018 ,1.0,45 minute waitMany items listed on the menu were not availableFood was blandCrowdedFelt like we were being pushed throughExpensive for qualityPoor experience
509,20-12-2018 ,4.0,"Visited this restaurant on a Sunday in December around 2/3pm. It was mobbed! I think it's always mobbed, and you can't book, so bare that in mind. We waited around 40mins for a table so went for a wander around the local area. The tables outside had their own queue system, so if you're in a rush that might be quicker. Once we sat down, service was extremely efficient and the food was delicious. Some of the portions were very small, even for tapas, but everything tasted great. It wasn't cheap, our lunch for 2 people including sangria and coffee and small desserts, came to 45EUR, but I guess for a nice treat that's OK."
510,19-12-2018 ,5.0,Worth booking this place in advance as it does get very busy. Excellent tapas menu with plenty to choose from and very helpful staff to advise you. Service great and not overly priced but still not the cheapest but well worth a visit. 
511,17-12-2018 ,5.0,"Went there yesterday. Still cannot stop thinking about how tasty all the dishes were, from garlic shrimp to beef tenderloin with foie to grilled cuttlefish to cod with honey aoli. Other good dishes not typically eaten in the U.S. include tomato bread, calcots (grilled local veggie that’s a cross between a leek and a green onion), and anchovies in vinegar. Definitely going back."
512,16-12-2018 ,5.0,"Went here for lunch. It’s been an hour waiting and the waitress told us to hang around and back to the restaurant in 30mins. After 30mins, we came back and waited for a short while and then we had our table. We ordered 7 dishes of tapas. The seafood is really nice! And they serve very well! A must visit in Barcelona! "
513,16-12-2018 ,5.0,"You’re waited like 6-7 minutes for a table for 2. Had the assorted tapas, tinto de verano and crema catalana. Everything really tasty. Definately a go in Barcelona "
514,15-12-2018 ,5.0,"Visiting from California and was recommended to go to this place. We went on a Tuesday night and it was farley packed and yes we had to wait.. which was no problem. I still was not familiar with tapas and flautas which is mostly what they sell (and other smaller plates)but the waiters were very helpful. I loved the service both times we have gone especially because we have two smaller kids. They are super accommodating and sweet. The hamburgers and hot dogs we buy for the kids are bite size but always share whatever we order with them. The dessert menu is delicious! A must try! If you don't mind waiting, try this place out! its delicious!"
515,15-12-2018 ,5.0,"I was here several times during my stay in Barcelona. Srvice is fast and helpful, Great variety of choices. Food is just delicious!I would recommend you to avoid the time of the lunch because it can get really crowded."
516,13-12-2018 ,5.0,"A party of 9, had 4 bottles of a very good red wine, didn't know what to order so just told the waiter ""let's start with a mix of 9 dishes and go from there"".Had a perfect evening, dishes all the time coming, food is great, service is very good, desserts are also execellent and eventually the bill was 350 euro, which is completely fair.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
517,12-12-2018 ,5.0,i love this place all my visite i was diner here Burger is the best of my life !!! I come back soon !
518,10-12-2018 ,4.0,"We ate there while visiting the city on a recommendation from a friend. A nice lively atmosphere, brightly lit, with a modern bistro feel. We waited for a table, but not long, and we could wait at the bar. Service was faster than most places in town. We enjoyed it, and would recommend it. Reasonable prices with lots of options."
519,9-12-2018 ,3.0,"We sat down, ordered... An voila the food arrived! Ok, fast service... And if everything arrived super hot I'd be thrilled. But it didn't - warm but not hot. Flavors were fine. After the first round we ordered a combo of eggs and small fries (huevo....). It arrived hot and delicious! The evening may have felt rushed, but still tasty... If not as hot as I might have liked. "
520,6-12-2018 ,5.0,"We walked past the restaurant by chance on a Sunday morning and noticed it was busy even though it wasn't even noon. Odd. The Spanish don't eat their lunch till late. Decided to double back after seeing Casa Mila and barely managed to snag a table as the crowd arrived after us. After noticing the crowd I decided I needed to check out Trip Advisor to find out what others were saying just as the food was arriving.The good was excellent. Fresh, tasty, wide variety of cold and hot tapas.Then the bill arrived. Another shock. What? That's less than what we paid most of the other places we ate at during our holiday in Spain. Now that's value for money.We had to go back for dinner and we did. Had the grilled prawns. Really sweet.Only regret was that we found the restaurant on our last day in Barcelona.So it's true. What everyone else says about this place is true. So good you want to keep coming back."
521,6-12-2018 ,5.0,"Excellent traditional spanish food / tapas. Very good service , helpful stuff, proffesionals. The food was very fresh, nice cooked with traditional , spanish , med cuisine!! Better than expected!! So Yummy plates , highly recommened!! Even spanish people chosen it. And that says a lot. You make a reservation before cause usually there are a lot of people waiting at the list. Be patient it is wothy!!!! "
522,5-12-2018 ,4.0,"My favorite tapas place in Barcelona for nearly 20 years. I come here every time I am in town.The buzzing atmosphere is unique. The food is very good - yet, I found it less crisp and less impressive than in the past."
523,3-12-2018 ,5.0,"Please book a table, we were lucky when we walk in, normally you will have to wait 30 min but it is worth it. Food is fresh and cooked in front of you. Great choice of tapas and wine. We spend there 2 hours. Place is small but pleasant, Service very fast and you will hardly notice them."
524,1-12-2018 ,4.0,If you like to taste catalan tapas at Barcelona. I think you must visit this restaurant. But you need half an hour to get the table. You must write your name at reservation desk.
525,30-11-2018 ,4.0,"this is our go to place for lunch, we've eaten here at least once on every trip we've taken to Barcelona in the last 20 years. it is always good. we arrive early for lunch 12-12.30 so we can eat at the bar, before the crowds arrive, by 13.00 its totally packed.we generally visit town in spring or autumn so there are always amazing mushrooms on the menu, during this visit they had a tower made from layers of foie gras and mushrooms that was positively sinful. of course the seafood is great and the cava's they recommend are always wonderful.great value for money, excellent service and lovely food."
526,28-11-2018 ,5.0,"We ate here twice during our 5-day visit to Barcelona, this restaurant was recommended by a friend who lived in Barcelona for years.The food is excellent, and not expensive. We tried out a large number of dishes (mostly seafood), all is freshly made on the premises, and the service is very friendly.However, in the evening (from 19:30 onwards) the place is packed, people were even queueing outside, expect a waiting time of 30-45 minutes. Even when we left around 22:30, the queue was still massive. So go in the afternoon, or early evening, and take a stool at the bar."
527,27-11-2018 ,5.0,Excellent Tapas restaurant. delicious! the staff super good. the service.. the taste.. very happy eating there!
528,27-11-2018 ,5.0,"We had to wait for 1 hour but the food is really delicious. We actually wanted paella but they say it is only thursdays served, so plan ahead."
529,26-11-2018 ,4.0,"Last night ate here. The place is busy every night so clearly it has earned a good reputation. The staff are cheery and hardworking.The interior is clean and modern, the tables small and fairly closely packed but not uncomfortable. The food came quickly and varies in quality between good and lick the bowl delicious. We particularly liked the black cod in spicy sauce. Including an enjoyable bottle of red and crunchy bread and butter pudding desserts we paid around 65 euro for two."
530,25-11-2018 ,5.0,"Came here upon recommendation from our hotel, very satisfied with the tapas dishes we came back again and again. The wait is long but price is competitive and food are delicious. We had both lunch and dinner and both times are equally busy. This restaurant is clearly popular. "
531,24-11-2018 ,5.0,You could tell by the queue outside this place is popular. We pitched up at 7pm ish and were told to come back in 40 minutes .We returned - got sat down and tucked into some delicious tapas.This place is a well oiled machine. Fast efficient service. Judging by the amount of locals in the restaurant- this is good.Well worth the visit.
532,24-11-2018 ,5.0,"We love Cerveceria Catalana,Good service, very good tapas can't go wrong even if you are vegetarian, We definitely will come back for more next trip! Try local beer Strella Galicia ."
533,23-11-2018 ,4.0,"We ate here twice, once for a quickie lunch and once for dinner. On both occasions the tapas were very good, the service good even with a full house of guests. We'll go back when we return to Barcelona"
534,23-11-2018 ,4.0,"Numerous visits in Barcelona and I have never Missed having dinner at cerveceria Catalans tapas bar ....Great atmosphere, nice chatting with Spanish Locals, tasty tapas and “montaditos”(small bites), good sangria and amazing desert :Crema Catalan. "
535,21-11-2018 ,5.0,"Fabulous place! Excellent tapas and a large choice of them - some ready to pick up, some you need to order. Some wines selection plus quite refreshing local beer. Service super nice. We had a dinner at the bar, since not willing to wait for a table and enjoyed it a lot!"
536,19-11-2018 ,5.0,"Tried to get inside, but in the first time we were beaten by the lineNext day came earlier and enjoyed great mealGreat tapas good sangria and good service Well worth it"
537,16-11-2018 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a beast. Thousands of covers a day and yet, the food is consistently good. They serve a range of hot and cold tapas which can be consumed at the bar or at a table. This is far from fine dining, but you can really enjoy a hearty meal. There is always (and I mean always) a queue, so be prepared to give your name and wait for a bit. Worth the wait. Excellent value for money. Deserts are also delicious: try the Santa Teresa crema - personal preference."
538,14-11-2018 ,5.0,We had lunch at Cerveceria Catalana during our last day in Barcelona. I wish we had discovered it before hand! The place was crowded but there waiter was friendly and attentive. Food was the delicious!! Best tapas we had in Barcelona! Also the desserts were great! Recommended! 
539,13-11-2018 ,3.0,"Was recommended as a must go place by some friends.Made the effort to go and the experience was a bit disappointing.Felt like a bit of a tourist trap and there was no service experience at all.Service staff were more like fast food service staff, just wanting you to order and churn you through so they could turn the tables over.Food was standard and at the end the server couldnt even give me the correct change.Perhaps my friends overhyped the place, but it was not memorable at all."
540,12-11-2018 ,5.0,Food was absolutely amazing. We had to wait an hour and a half for our table so put our names on a list and went away for a drink. The tapas was delicious. The cod to die for. Highly recommend a visit if you’re in Barcelona.
541,10-11-2018 ,1.0,"Probably the worse tapas I ever had in Barcelona. Waiting 45 minutes for greasy junk food, not even close to a Catalunya street restaurant. "
542,10-11-2018 ,4.0,"Though the restaurant is quite spacious, it gets quite crowded during lunchtime with a long waiting queue. We went a bit early so had a wonderful seating outside. We tried the long clams, I did not take a liking for it. The peppers are not for the ones who cannot tolerate spicy stuff. Its good though. The shrimps is reasonably good. Batata tapas is always good to have. I totally liked the cheese mozzarella with almond crumbs. It had a kind of a crunchy taste to it. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Staff is pretty well versed in the menu."
543,9-11-2018 ,5.0,"This was the best Spanish tapas I’ve experienced. Visited on a Thursday night. With dozens of tapas restaurants with plenty of seats available, this one seemed to be the only one where there were dozens waiting outside for a table. Luckily you can wait for a quicker seat at the bar. The light fried giant artichokes were my favorite. Also delicious cooked shrimp with mus"
544,9-11-2018 ,3.0,"We ordered Sangria as many people recommended it. However, the taste was not very rich --I was expecting more fruity and stronger alcoholic taste -- maybe because there were too much ice cubes in it. Slightly disappointed. The food, not a big portion but ok. We ordered a couple of plates of tapes. The cheap ones had failed my expectations. So, go for the expensive ones. I would consider this restaurant being at a ££££ level if you want to eat well."
545,8-11-2018 ,2.0,Arrived at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night in November - the place was rammed and no chance of getting a table so we went elsewhere. Would have been helpful to be able to book. 
546,8-11-2018 ,4.0,"Really packed tapas bar so 45 mins wait for a table. Organised mix of Tapas between 4, by far the best was beef steak with foie gras, but all well executed if slightly unimaginative. Great selection of beers and relatively short wine list but reasonable well priced. Service mixed. "
547,7-11-2018 ,5.0,"Great place for tapas in Barcelona, very crowded and lively at the peak Spanish hours. Well located, it's equally loved by locals and tourists, enjoy it!"
548,7-11-2018 ,4.0,"A classic place to go for lunch or dinner.Food is good. You will have to line, but it is worth it.In the center of Barcelona, convenient.You will find other tourists though."
549,7-11-2018 ,5.0,"Found this in the guide book, bookings unavailable but eventually got a table and it was well worth the wait. The tapas were amazing, we shared a bottle of rioja and the food just kept coming.So much choice and all freshly prepared the ham, patatas braves, bacon with blue cheese wonderful!"
550,6-11-2018 ,5.0,"One of the best places to enjoy tapas and a good, good Beer and Sangria, its always crowded be prepared to wait 45 minutes, Your are not be disappointed"
551,6-11-2018 ,5.0,"Whenever I visit Barcelona, this is a “MUST” stop which is kind of difficult as there is always a long wait. But the wait is worthwhile. Another option is to go off peak hours. But you definitely must eat here. When you go don’t miss ordering: pinchos de camarones, fried brie cheese, solomillo, pulpo a la gallega, huevos cabreaos and so many other tapas. And don’t forget dessert, bread pudding, churros."
552,6-11-2018 ,5.0,"This was recommended to my husband and I by a few friends, and it did not disappoint. It was actually our first true tapas meal, and it was everything I hoped for and more. It was a busy place, but do not get overwhelmed! The staff is very helpful and will suggest items to you. Try everything!"
553,6-11-2018 ,4.0,"My wife and i arrived around 3 pm hoping the place would not be crowded.The place was packed and we did not have a reservationLucky we got a couple of seats at the barWe immediately ordered a bottle of Penedes wine ,very cold and was excellent The restaurant was serving paella for everybody and we went along with the crowd The food is good but don’t show without a reservation as you are risking the trip"
554,6-11-2018 ,4.0,"We went there around 7 pm and was told there was an hour wait. As our hotel was nearby, we decided to come back the next day for a late 3 pm lunch where there were enough people eating to give the place a buzz, but not so full that we had to wait. The fresh steamed clams were succulent and sweet. Loved the roasted cod with honey although the cod could have been a bit fresher. The daily special of mushrooms and calamari was so-so. Enjoyed the foie gras and beef tenderloin - the portion was extremely generous for the price.We went to Ciudad Condal today for lunch and found that it had the exact same menu and daily specials as Cerveceria Catalana. Turns out that they are sister companies. So save yourself the trip and eat at one (any one) versus the other. Cerveceria's decor is more modern and new whilst Ciudad Condal's is more old-style. The items that we had at Ciudad Condal that you should try here are the fried eggplant drizzled with honey (daily special) and smoked salmon montaditos."
555,4-11-2018 ,5.0,Any trip to Barcelona should be complete without a trip here. it is a well run machine and the quality of food and drink is excellent. 
556,3-11-2018 ,5.0,Recommended by our hotel concierge. Excellent lunch! Everything super fresh and tasty. Great gin and tonics. Had a few desserts including the something tower (the ask for the tall one). One of the best desserts we’ve ever had.
557,3-11-2018 ,5.0,"My husband and I were wondering what the long line was about when we passed this place. The next night we checked it out. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we were able to get a seat. It was worth the wait! Everything we ordered was really good. The mini cheese burger, shrimp ajillo, boquerones, and the tenderloin sanwich was outstanding! The staff is very efficient and friendly. Highly recommend"
558,30-10-2018 ,5.0,"What a great, fun, delicious place for tapas. The restaurant was referred to us by friends who used to live in Barcelona. We were there for 5 nights and went to this place twice. It really was terrific. Highly recommend."
559,28-10-2018 ,4.0,Service and staff was great. I highly recommend their paella.....it was delicious. Serving size was a lot
560,28-10-2018 ,5.0,"Definitely worth a visit. Great, friendly service. Food was terrific. The best we had out of the places that we visited in Barcelona :) you should sit at the bar for the full experience."
561,27-10-2018 ,5.0,"Brilliant food, great service, all the tapas we tried were amazing. If there's one highlight of them all I'd have to pick the pork loin with foie, a must try for sure. There may be a bit of a wait, a reservation would take care of that!"
562,27-10-2018 ,4.0,"After repeated recommendations that we ""must"" try Cervercia Catala, we got there a little early for lunch. The wait wasn't too long, but the service was a tad slow to slow. Once we put our orders in, however, they just kept coming! The food was good, especially the croquetes and shrimp. The Tortilla Patatsa were a little bland. The prices are great! so great, that if you don't like what you've ordered, just get something else. Best deal in Barcelona! if you can tolerate the waiting."
563,25-10-2018 ,5.0,"This is a very chaotic restaurant in the middle of the city.It’s well run and the food is terrific.Best to put your name in early or it’s a solid hour wait. Unless you can find a seat at the bar. Huge menu is available, but try the daily specials. "
564,24-10-2018 ,5.0,"TAPASWent there for dinner, an hour wait!Came back for lunch!Very fresh and delicious food.Sat outside on the terrace.Interesting menu.Don’t miss it!"
565,24-10-2018 ,2.0,"We had heard great things about this restaurant and so the 25 minute wait did not seem excessive. The dishes came which satisfied my wife and daughters orders but despite chasing, only one effective side dish came of my order before we had finished everything. In the end I had to cancel my dishes on the basis that I had given up they would ever come. What was disappointing was they didn’t seem to care or feel that this was an issue. I like tapas but single dish of pototao in this gastronomic Mecca does not make a meal. Just let down and disappointed!"
566,23-10-2018 ,3.0,"A mixed bag. Very crowdy place. 20 min. wait time at 7pm, queued up to 60 min. at 8pm. Personnel was friendly, food was good. But sitting at the bar would have been authentic while the table section felt too much like touristic come in and get out.Recommended for food but very much less for atmosphere..."
567,23-10-2018 ,5.0,"A heck of a wait for our party of 4 (around 50 minutes - obviously due to populatity), but wow it was certainly worth it.Wonderful food, cooked to perfection. Excellent selection and extremely friendly and patient staff. Could eat here every night! "
568,23-10-2018 ,5.0,"My friend & I were at the bar when a couple of bottles of wine (open, of course, & red) were knocked over. The staff were amazing. I've never seen such genuine concern over an accidental incident.That was a good start, & then the food arrived & it was excellent. We had a variety of tapas. All were full of flavour, beautifully cooked & presented.Looking forward to our next visit."
569,23-10-2018 ,4.0,"Insider tip - they keep large tables for large parties, so when our group of 7 showed up with no reservation (not sure if they accept reservations) we just walked in. We made the mistake of having our waiter choose our menu including a few dishes we knew we wanted to try. A 10 minutes later this resulted in a sudden rush of non stop dishes arriving to our table. We didn't want them to get cold, so we were eating quick. Then we realized they were just shoveling out dishes to flip the table quicker, so we asked them to stop, and they did, so we took our time, slowed down and enjoyed the evening. So my suggestion is to not let the waiters choose for you. The wagyu beef with foie gras was to die for, clams/shrimp/lobster dish was awesome, shishito peppers if you want veggies otherwise skip, grilled calamari. So good! don't let waiters order for you. If you're a small group and don't want to wait best to make it a really later, really early, or mid afternoon meal. enjoy!"
570,22-10-2018 ,5.0,The line at this place says it all. There is always a line but it's worth the wait. The food is amazing. The service is very fast. The servers are a mix of Spanish and Filipino. The Filipino servers usually speak English. Everything was good. We ate there twice during our stay in Barcelona.
571,22-10-2018 ,4.0,"Visited in September 2017 - Had great tapas here, had to guess what the items were on the menu as there was no septate English menu, which we had to use translator on our phone! Great food though, even the dessert was good to"
572,22-10-2018 ,5.0,"This restaurant popped up when I searched ""best restaurants near me"". We were shocked at how crowded it was, but we had a drink at the bar and waited for our table. Everything we tried was delicious, including dessert! I only wish my stomach was larger so that I could have tried more!!"
573,21-10-2018 ,5.0,"This was my first experience of Tapas in BCN and they set the bar really high that we ate twice over there. Had to wait 45 minutes for a table but once we got in it was worthy the wait. The taps were fast to come and sooo delicious. It is a very busy place and lively. Waiters could be a bit more cheerful but I can’t say the are not helpful. Try the Cod with honey as it is out of this world. Other wonderful dishes are the tenderloin, garlic prawns, Pardon peppers and end it with nice churros. "
574,21-10-2018 ,5.0,We had a very delicious tapas for lunch here. I would definitely want to visit again. No surprise that it has such a high rating at TA. 
575,20-10-2018 ,3.0,"It's full than people waiting, after 45 min we got a table, food was not bad but nothing special, service was fast and prices a bit hight, 3 stars"
576,20-10-2018 ,4.0,"We were recommended this restaurant but warned about the wait. We did not believe it and attempted to go on our first night in Barcelona, be warned the later you go the longer you will wait. However once you are in the food comes out fast, is absolutely delicious and is very reasonably priced. Well worth the wait."
577,19-10-2018 ,5.0,"This place is a must visit in Barcelona. Unreal food and very fair pricing. I could have eaten here every day. Great service as well. Be prepared for a solid line up (usually 30-60 minutes during peak hours). There’s an English menu, but make sure to order the clams off the Spanish version on the front page. Salud!!"
578,18-10-2018 ,4.0,"We found this restaurant recommended in a guide book. There was a good selection of tapas and other light bites available for reasonable prices (roughly between £1.60 and £9.95). All food appeared to be cooked fresh to order and just a few plates were enough for a nice lunch. There was a good selection of local and imported beers at a fair price. Staff were friendly and attentive, happy to help in English. And enjoyable spot for lunch, close to some tourist attractions but frequented by locals too."
579,14-10-2018 ,5.0,"I have gone to this restaurant several times during my last visit to Barcelona. Their red sangria is a must try; same goes for potato dishes and crostini with steak and foie gras(if you like it, I happened to love it). Prices are very reasonable, one complaint is the wait. They don't take reservations and always have a line, the most I had to wait was 2h. It was worth it. It is my must visit place in Barcelona."
580,14-10-2018 ,3.0,"Offers a wide variety of creative dishes and your run of the mill tapas selection. The dishes are just ok, none of the dishes we had were outstanding. Definitely a tourist trap, as reflected by the client base. Very long lines with a fast food feel to the service. With many outstanding Tapas places in Barcelona, cannot recommend it as a must try when visiting Barcelona, unless you are there for their very good Sangria's."
581,12-10-2018 ,5.0,They dont take reservations so don't go there too hungry. We waited for 30 mins but all worth it. The waiter recommended certain food and sure good. Sangria is a must. 
582,12-10-2018 ,4.0,"Very good price for value and a huge range of tapas. The fried anchovies are just fantastic! Do also try the “Cod fish with tomato salsa and honey” and the mushroom/asparagus plate. We recommend to take a place at the bar to get the feeling. However this is a very touristy place, so make sure you go early if you tend to get hangry... "
583,9-10-2018 ,4.0,"While this place is very good and has tasty tapas, it kind of feels like a tourist trap at times. The line ups are super long and I’m not sure they are quite worth it. With so many amazing tapas restaurants in Barcelona, I don’t think I will be going back here. The waiters felt very robotic and I didn’t really enjoy my dining experience as I have in other restaurants."
584,9-10-2018 ,3.0,"We just arrived Barcelona and head straight to town for a late lunch. Waited for 20 minutes for a table and there was a long queue. The restaurant is very popular and noticed that the patrons were mostly tourists, both local and foreigners. Even thought it is crowded the service was very efficient and fast. The tapas were good and delicious."
585,8-10-2018 ,5.0,We ate there twice during our stay in Barcelona in September. The food and the service were great. We waited only 15-20 minutes for our table. Definitely the best tapas we had not only in Barcelona but in all other cities we visited in Spain during our 18 days visit.
586,7-10-2018 ,5.0,"Great luch, fast service, fresh products. Maybe in the evening bit too crowded but for lunch a great place. "
587,7-10-2018 ,5.0,We knew we were onto a winner when we were told they don’t take bookings here and we arrived about 10 mins after opening to find a queue already outside. This is the best tapas in Barcelona. Lots of choice. Served quickly and very tasty We tried a good selection and everything was delicious. Nice to have a dessert menu which also offered small portion desserts for when you just need a tiny sweet finish. 
588,6-10-2018 ,3.0,"We were there a bit after 19h and had to wait about 30 minutes (we were ready for this, as we have read several reviews).The food was not bad. The service, however... They were really impatient to see us gone, as there was a long queue.Overall we were not extremely impressed."
589,6-10-2018 ,4.0,"We went on 5 October as a couple and were able to get a space almost instantly at the bar, whereas the wait for a table was as much as an hour. Service was snappy and food was good. Ultimately my only criticism is that we were in and out in 50 minutes, a bit too fast really for what was going to be our dinner, but this not really a critique of the restaurant so much as a critique of tapas as a culinary form."
590,5-10-2018 ,5.0,"We ate at cevreceria Catalunia so many times. We live in Barcelona now and whenever we have freinds or family coming to visit we take them to eat there.The food is good. Great tapas. The only upseting things is the fact that the line is very long and if you are a party of 4 or more you have to wait more than an hour foa a table - but it's worth it.And the fact that the menu of the day is not in English.But still it""s worth a visit when in Barcelona."
591,4-10-2018 ,4.0,"We were recommended this spot by my cousin and didnt have dinner plans for the night so decided to check it out. The wait was a little crazy. Endless people coming in and out of the restaurant putting themselves on the list and waiting to be called. After a full hour of waiting we were finally seated and i was very impressed with the service and the wait for food. Overall the food was really wonderful and the desserts were even better. But only head over here if you are okay with standing in line for an hour to eat, you can definitely find equally delicious tapas without waiting at all "
592,4-10-2018 ,3.0,Travelling by myself I’m acutely aware of how staff treat me. I felt uncomfortable the moment I walked through the door. Asked for a sangria and the waitress said ‘only 1 ltr’ Then walked away. As I got up to leave she said ‘oh we have something similar in a glass’ so I ordered it. When I asked about the menu I received no help. ‘I like scallops and seafood’ to which she replied ‘no scallops’. Having heard excellent things about this place I was optimistic. Food was excellent. No doubt about that. But as an experience I’m disappointed.
593,3-10-2018 ,2.0,"Definitely not worth the wait. The food and ambiance left a lot to be desired. We got a drink and 2 tapas and left to go elsewhere, would not recommend. (If you're over there, try something like La Pepita instead!)"
594,3-10-2018 ,5.0,"2nd time I have been here (last time 5 years ago) and it hasn't changed one bit... you can't book a table, you turn up, put your name down and wait but teh wait is well worth it. The food is the best Tapas in Barcalona..... took another two couples here for their first time and they said it was the best meal they had on the whole of our trip... service is brilliant and ambience is perfect."
595,2-10-2018 ,5.0,We ate at Cerveceria Catalana on our first day in Barcelona and it set the bar high for the rest of our dining experiences. We sat at the bar and watched all of the different Tapas come out. We went back on another day and sat at a table for a different experience but loved the food just the same.
596,2-10-2018 ,5.0,A friend told us to check this restaurant out and we are so glad we did.The restaurant was busy and buzzing. The food was a wonderful mix of unique and traditional. So good!
597,2-10-2018 ,5.0,this crowded tapas restaurant serves a variety of tapas and one by one are tasty and inviting. it is realy worth to wait for a table and it takes 15 minutes.
598,1-10-2018 ,5.0,"One of the best tapas restaurants in Barcelona. This was recommended as one of the local favorites and it did not disappoint! We had a shrimp crabmeat and avacado dish that was absolutely amazing!! Excellent wine selection too!! The service was timely and wait staff were very friendly. Prices were moderate and in line with the excellent tappas offerings. As with any great restaurant, be prepared for a little bit of a wait, but well worth it. Highly recommend a visit when in the Passeig de Grassia area."
599,1-10-2018 ,1.0,Claudia who was in charge of seating patrons was rude and unfriendly. We left and ate in another wonderful restaurant. Our only bad experience in three weeks in Spain.
600,28-09-2018 ,3.0,"When we arrived it was extremely busy and proceded to queue to put our names on the register and queued again and waited an hour and 20 minutes, we were getting so hungry but managed to hold on, when we did eventually get a spot, we ordered a variety of tapas, the food is ok, definitely not worth waiting in the queue for so long. I do not understand why this place got rated 4.5 stars.The funniest thing I saw was while waiting in the queue, is that the place was soo busy people were standing up to eat."
601,26-09-2018 ,5.0,One of the best dining experiences in Barcelona! The restaurant was busy even at midnight on a Tuesday night. After a slight wait (it was worth it) we had excellent service and the wide variety of food was appealing for my fiancé and I. We will def be back! 
602,26-09-2018 ,5.0,"It is a very nice place, close to the Rambla, with Excelent food, very reasonable prices and nice people."
603,25-09-2018 ,4.0,"A great place to lunch after a visit to Gaudí’s La Pedrera in the morning. It’s only 5 minutes away. Good service from the staff. Tasty tapas. We loved the spicey shrimps and the house paella. Reasonable serving portions. We will be back here in 3 days when we visit Gaudi’s other famous casa, Casa Batllo."
604,24-09-2018 ,4.0,"Very nice restaurant, serving both local food and other dishesThe atmosphere is good for both a romantic meal and a meeting with friends. recommended"
605,23-09-2018 ,5.0,"Our first evening in Barcelona on our way back to our hotel we passed this charming place with a BIG line-up and a 45 minute minimum wait ( mostly locals )Well of course we absolutely had to eat there. Next day we skipped breakfast and made our way over there for lunch at noon. Yes, there was a line-up but just as we approached the counter to put our name on the list for a table 2 spots opened up at the bar. Much better! All the tapas options were displayed in front of us and all we had to do was point and the plate would go back to the kitchen to be cooked. Outstanding and then some. To describe the choices would be a disservice. For drinks we had a delicious white sangria and chowed down on as many delightful little plates of goodies as we could manage. "
606,22-09-2018 ,5.0,"Great tapas, a must have is the beef with foie gras it was spectacular and a must have. The sangria was great too."
607,22-09-2018 ,5.0,We had great tapas here. You pay for better quality but not outrageous. Worth to check out if you've only been eating on Las Ramblas for your trip. 
608,19-09-2018 ,5.0,"Despite the fact that we had to wait an hour before getting a table, the food was delicious and the service was very fast! I had an excellent Crema Catalana. You should definitely go to this restaurant, but be prepared for a long queue. "
609,19-09-2018 ,4.0,"Went after the hype. Food is good but no more, dont expect something special. We were told we would need to wait for 45min but called our name after 5min. I think you can get better for the same price which is around 60euro for 2."
610,17-09-2018 ,5.0,Excellent restaurant for original tapas. Extended menu. lots of choices. You just need to have the patience to wait for a table. Its worth it.
611,16-09-2018 ,5.0,"We had a recommendation to try to restaurant while in Barcelona. We liked it so much on our first visit, we went back a second time for leaving Barcelona. Both the food and service were top shelf. It is definitely a place to try if you visit there. The prices were reasonable, the the choices for food unlimited. I would recommend you go early, or you might have to wait up to an hour. We generally tried to be there between 7-8:00 PM and did not have to wait for a table."
612,15-09-2018 ,5.0,"We came here as a recommendation and it did not disappoint. We arrived at 11pm with a 20 minute wait which turned into 10 minutes, food service and the atmosphere was fantastic of this busy popular restaurant. There is something for everyone and the food was delicious, so many choices and if your spanish is not great you can just pick from the tap on display. Loved this place . "
613,14-09-2018 ,5.0,"This was our first stop in Barcelona and it did not disappoint. I was recommended here by a friend and could not wait to try it out. We got there around 5PM and got a seat at one of the bar service tables really quick. Service was fast and we enjoyed so many tapas that dinner was a struggle later (but you never pass up a meal in Barcelona)! The server was helpful in explaining potion sizes and guiding our experience. Prices were mid-range and it was good value. The options and quality were some of the best I saw in the city. We tried a variety of the meat and cheeses, the cava, potatoes bravas, churros...and more. I highly recommend this as a top tapas option."
614,13-09-2018 ,5.0,"Visited after a recommendation from a friend and it was the best decision we made the whole trip. You have to put your name on a waiting list and we were told it was a 40 minute wait which judging by the popularity of the place seemed to be worth it. At this time, we were also told, that it was first come first serve at the bar area and luckily enough after waiting 10 minutes we got a seat at the bar. Ordered straight away and the food cam pretty quickly, each dish being as delicious as the next. We also ordered a litre of sangria to wash it down which was also lovely. I have a sweet tooth and reluctantly let the server chose a dish for us, it was similar to creme brûlée but inside pastry and it was divine!We ended up returning on our last night as we had to catch a taxi back to the airport at 8pm and most restaurants don't open until then. So once again we had a lovely evening and got to try even more dishes from the menu. A must visit when in Barcelona for the tapas fans out there!"
615,13-09-2018 ,5.0,"The tapas was excellent, everything was delicious, the place is nice but you have to wait a long time without reservation "
616,10-09-2018 ,5.0,Must eat if they haveRazor clams Grilled sardinesAll others are always on the menu:Red shrimpCockles Black paella Churros con chocolate 
617,9-09-2018 ,1.0,"We were drawn there by friends who were total fans of the place and very very fond of it.1. I don't get the idea to wait for a table 1 hour.2. I don't get the idea of eating tapas as main course - they serve stuff we usually eat at home when we don't have anything to eat and we empty the fridge.3. Very grasy oily and I had stomachache after it.4. Overpriced - we paid 100 Eur for 4 pax just having some finger food and 6 draft beers no coffee, no desserts in this price.5. Very crowded noisy and smelly (fried food).6. I admire the waiters - really great professionals and very kind and patient.I cannot imagine to stand all that crowd serving hundreds of small plates one after another . Although very popular and highly recommended I thinj there are much better places in Barcelona."
618,9-09-2018 ,3.0,"I can’t really say anything negative about the place other than it’s overpriced for standard tapas. We had far better food and service at several of the other local tapas bars and eateries. It was a friend’s recommendation which we are always grateful for. However, we were fortunate enough to find several other far better Tapas bars/restaurants. I recommend Tapas Madre at Mallorca and Bruc and will miss their “Joselita” entre, as well as their Spanish Omlette (the best we had out of several we tried) and the duck. "
619,8-09-2018 ,4.0,"Came here for dinner with hubby yesterday, we gave our names to the reception lady, and waited for around 30-45min on a Friday evening at 7pm. This restaurant does not take any bookings. The restaurant table turnaround is very fast, people that turns up expect to wait outside the restaurant or at the bar, but bar area hasn’t got much space at all as people sit by the bar to eat as well. Food is absolutely amazing!!! Now, the reason why I didn’t gave this a full mark review is due to our waitress did not explain the menu. It comes in 3 different languages one being in English, what we didn’t realise is the front of the menu has another menu in Spanish! Now that’s where all the good stuff is such as razor clams, clams and other food that is not in the English menu. We saw the waitress bringing those dishes to other customers, so we asked her for it. We took L3 MTR line, and got off Diagonal station which is around 5 min walk. Worth the wait, lovely food. Do take time to google translate the front page of the menu ;)"
620,8-09-2018 ,4.0,"Great tables, food was delicious and a lot of variety with very different tastes , we went without reservation the 8 of us and were seated in 15 mins, the food is some how expensive but the experience worth the money, the beef and sea food tapas were great "
621,8-09-2018 ,5.0,"This place is great! They have a multiple delicious tapas at reasonable prices. We loved every tapa we tried, including the dessert. Be aware that this restaurant is always full and has a wait of 45 minutes to an hour. My recommendation is to get on the waiting list and walk to discord block to see the famous houses while you wait."
622,7-09-2018 ,5.0,"so yums, was recommended by our concierge at Monument Hotel. we got there around 730 and place was very busy already. daily tapas menu was in spanish so we got the waitor to recommend a few dishes. EVery dish was delicious! esp The aioli cod was just superb we ordered it twice. the spinach lasagna was good but bit tooo cheesy for asian liking. razor clams were great. we were so full but still ordered the ice cream dessert , and we devoured it. get the sangria, since ur in Spain! "
623,5-09-2018 ,5.0,My coworker recommended this place and it did not disappoint. It’s a very busy place which is always a good sign. I found a seat at the bar and eveything I had was delicious. Definitely worth another visit...
624,3-09-2018 ,5.0,"You must try tapas menü. If you are six, should order 2 diffrent for each of you and you can taste all the menu. My favorite was 'sepiones a la plancha', a cotton wise soft taste of calamri. Do not miss the desert menü where they create Art work tastes. Typical Crema Catalana was öne of best cream brulee ever had. Prices are fair compated the taste you get and service is also friendly. Watch out you have wait around 30 min to get a table."
625,3-09-2018 ,1.0,"Sorry, but how is this place 4.5 stars? Everything has a healthy coating of oil. Tomato bread - each slice of bread has at least a tablespoon of oil. Oily is not better. Prawn skewer was decent, would get again, but nothing to write home about. Spanish omelette - ok, again, something you would find at a greasy spoon kind of place. Bread with jamon iberico - if they had skipped the oil, would’ve been quite good. I’d say avoid, better places in Barcelona."
626,1-09-2018 ,5.0,"This was our first experience with tapas in Spain, and still our favorite! Our two school-age children raved about everything (even our picky eater). They do all the classic dishes well: patatas bravas, calamari, tomato bread, and on and on. The churros and chocolate we ordered for dessert was the best I had in our week in Spain. We came here around 5 pm, and got in after a short wait; the line was much longer when we left."
627,31-08-2018 ,5.0,"Classic tapas and great service, the flauta de solomilo, huevos estrellados, gambas al ajillo are some of my favourites"
628,31-08-2018 ,5.0,"This place has a long wait, but my word is it worth the wait! We went twice in the space of 5 days. Not to be missed! Eat till your hearts content. Will forever hold a special place in my heart."
629,31-08-2018 ,5.0,We have been to Cerveceria Catalana many times over the years and we have never been disappointed with the food or the service. And once again we had our seeting at the bar (which is where you should eat) and enjoyed all the courses served by a smiling and talkative staff. Thanks a lot for a really nice time :-)
630,31-08-2018 ,5.0,"Amazing food, fresh, huge variety and more importantly great service that delivers food and drink quickly. We absolutely love this place and the staff and of course the food. It’s popular, very popular but that’s a good thing right?"
631,29-08-2018 ,5.0,"This place was top of our list. It is always crowded and always a line BUT you don't have to queue to sit on the high stools at the bar. if you see one grab it, and you have a view of lots of tapas and you are given a menu. The staff behind the bar are brilliant with explanation of the foods etc. You can pick by your eyes which is a great experience or stick to what you know on the menu. It is a great spot for lunch on the way back from the Sagrada Familia. It is cheap for the quality of food you get. We had several tapas, dessert tapas, coffee and beer for two people and the total was 36 euro! Well worth a visit."
632,29-08-2018 ,5.0,"Enjoyed the food here thoroughly. Fresh and full of flavours.Sat at the bar counter and atmosphere is busy but very interesting. Recommended to anyone who visits Barcelona. Waitress Cherry's recommendations is great and very friendly, looking forward to come back again."
633,29-08-2018 ,4.0,This place looks fancy but actually their prices are quite affordable and reasonable. It's also easy for solo travellers as they have bar seats right in front of the wide array of tapas spread (where you can see and choose what u want). Great tapas and great service -waiter pays attention and will clear your plates when you're done (probably for fast turnover too as there's a waiting line of customers). The staff were friendly n I love the recommendation of the dessert by the waiter! Pls take note that the bar is always packed so you may want to book and reserve a table if you're coming in groups.
634,27-08-2018 ,3.0,"This place was really good a few years ago however, it changed for the worse. The food is just average, and the wait is long. The cooking seems to be rushed. The service is OK. "
635,27-08-2018 ,1.0,"Put our name on the waiting list and was told to wait outside for 15 minutes and we would be called. After waiting 30 minutes and seeing other people that arrived after us getting tables, we went back in to the booking desk to enquire how much longer we had to wait. We were told by the woman we had given our name to that we never put our name on the list, that she didn't know who we were and couldn't even remember us - she kept implying that either we were making up that we gave her our name, or that we gave her a different name?! Her attitude was absolutely appalling considering we had waited outside for half an hour due to her mistake. She didn't even offer us the next table, told us we were in the wrong and kept showing us the book that didn't have our name as if that was proof we had not been in (instead of it actually proving she just never took down our name after saying she would). Not once did she apologize. Safe to say we left and will not be in a rush back - regardless of how good the tapas is meant to be, I would prefer to spend my money in the many other restaurants where customers are valued and appreciated."
636,27-08-2018 ,5.0,"A very busy tapas restaurant, with queues up to one hour for a table but you can leave your name and come back later to check progress. Luckily for us some people hadn’t returned and so we got a table outside within 10 mins or so, and am so grateful as the food is amazing. Make sure you go along hungry and try as many dishes as your eyes, stomach and budget allow as the food is amazing and reasonably priced (around 90 euros for jug of sangria and around 8-10 dishes). Highlights for me the cod with honey (sounds weird but god it’s good), the beef and foie on bread, octopus. But it’s all very very good and with a nice atmosphere and service too. "
637,26-08-2018 ,4.0,Second visit here and again it didn’t disappoint. Very busy and we waited approximately 20 minutes which was fine and we had a drink at the bar. When you give your name for the waiting list let them know if you’re prepared to share. On a previous visit we got seated quicker ( with another couple at a 6 table)The menu is extensive. Although busy we never felt rushed and staff are quite happy for you to keep adding to your order. Go outwith Spanish dining times and it will be less busy
638,26-08-2018 ,5.0,"I was looking for a light lunch while strolling the streets of Barcelona and luckily stumbled into Cervecería Catalana. I was very lucky to find a seat at the bar, because the place was packed - waiting time was up to 45 minutes when I got there. I my seat and was greeted by two very nice staff members who served me straight from the bar. The Tapas which were displayed were absolutely stunning. The whole counter showed a wide array of different seafood salads, salads and an incredible amount of Tapas in general. I ordered a plate of mixed Tapas and in addition some single plates, which were all fantastic. Some dishes were simple, some were more complex in their preparation, but everything was extremely tasty, very complex in both flavour and texture. I absolutely enjoyed everything and would highly recommend paying a visit. However, if you're not coming on your own, I'd suggest you reserve a table beforehand in order to avoid having to wait."
639,25-08-2018 ,4.0,"My friends and I passed this place a number of times in our route back and forth to our hotel, and it was ALWAYS jammed so we figured we’d see what the hype was about. Got a half pitcher of sangria that was really yummy and not exhorbetantly priced. The menu had a good variety and everything we had was delicious. Service was okay, but typical for shared service style restaurants like this. Do yourself a favor and look through the cases of freshly made tapas by the bars to see what looks good to you before you sit down - it will be helpful when you are overwhelmed by choices. Ask for suggestions, as the waiters know the menu very well and will tell you what’s fresh or popular that day. Get the fried to order churros! The wait was far less than they told us to expect, so just grab some sangria and chill while you peruse the fresh offerings of the day!"
640,25-08-2018 ,3.0,"Came here 4 years ago when I was in BCN, came here again this time because I totally forgot the name and my friend said she really wants to go to this restaurant and told me the name. I thought I’ve never been. When I finally came, I thought OH right. Okay, so we still waited for a table. The lady at the reception and the guy outside who’s managing the queue for the outside tables are pretty rude. Like yeah okay, we get it you are a popular place but cmon at least smile and greet us. Anyway we got seated after 15-20mins wait. Not bad. Got a jug of white sangria, some tapas - some hits and misses - average quality really. And not cheap for this average quality. It’s also really noisy and feels like I’m in a cafeteria. There’s no sense of plating or making the dishes look nice. The prawns in oil was over cooked.Honestly, you’ll have a better experience at La Flauta which is where we went the next night and absolutely loved it!! A lot of locals recommend that too. This place is just tooo touristy. I wouldn’t bother coming again. Also, a friend of mine came with her bf last time and her bf’s bag got stolen! So be careful and watch your stuff! "
641,23-08-2018 ,5.0,"Altamente recomendable. I would definitely recommend this place, scrumptious food. Excellent service"
642,23-08-2018 ,1.0,"Please avoid this place. The service is really subpar. Heard it from other reviewers,but still went against my better judgement and regretted it. Check out La Pepita. Definitely much better and better customer service as well! "
643,23-08-2018 ,5.0,"We were recommended this place by our hotel and went with expectation we might have a long wait to be seated. The place was packed and we were told it could be half an hours wait...20 minutes later we sat ready to go! We tried an array of tapas, loved the camembert and bravas, and simply couldn't find fault with any of the dishes! It was all so good we had 3 deserts as we couldn't choose, and they didn't disappoint either! We had a bottle of wine and a jug of sangria, plus a good 10 or so tapas and came to about €80 euros. Would highly recommend this place and wI'll definitely be coming back if we get the chance!"
644,22-08-2018 ,5.0,"We tried the Friend Baby Squids, Pan Con Tomate (best we have tried), Gambas... Very Delicious.The restaurant is airy with an side patio. Lovely and cozy ambience."
645,22-08-2018 ,2.0,"Avoid it, its very touristic, and the value for price is not justified, its extremely fast food like, the food is a disappointment, we really regret wasting a meal there.. "
646,21-08-2018 ,5.0,"we have very nice place in Barcelona very nice place beers for , and enjoy much of the beer it is good Barcelona drink restaurants"
647,21-08-2018 ,5.0,"Went there with my girlfriend on our first night in Barcelona. The atmosphere is nice, noisy and alive but never exaggerated. Without reservation we waited less than 15 mins to get a table on Saturday night. Good service. We had a lot of different tapas and a few beers, all the food was nice and we only spent 60€. I recommend this place."
648,20-08-2018 ,4.0,Tapas are amazingly tasteful! I suggest booking before coming since the place is always packed mostly at night. Got a table but needed to wait for at least an hour. Like I said tapas here are delicious but on the pricey side. Not ideal for kids since food choices are more on tapas only. It’s worth the experience. Service is very efficient and friendly.
649,20-08-2018 ,2.0,Long wait for average food. Friendly staff. Queues out the door and rave reviews on here - don’t know what the fuss is about- not very authentic Spanish experience 
650,20-08-2018 ,5.0,You can enjoy delicious food in decent prices. The tortilla and the shrimps were excellent. The place is very warm and friendly
651,20-08-2018 ,5.0,"This place has a long wait...if you want to eat here, come before you’re done shopping by around 30-45 mins to put your name down...it took us 3 times to finally get it right. The food was great...we had the grilled squid, sole, filet with foie, regular filet (for kids), patatas bravas and sangria. We ended with 3 desserts (creme Catalan, bread pudding and millefeuille) which were amazing...left extremely satisfied."
652,19-08-2018 ,5.0,"To begin, 10 of us went here while in Barcelona for a special occasion. Both Jordi and Jordi, went out of their way to accommodate us in the dining room of this very popular restaurant in Gracia neighborhood. We cannot say enough how it was appreciated… And the food .. one word “Fabulous”. There was a wide range of palates in the group and there were more than enough choices to satisfy all. As a matter of fact, we liked it so much, two of us went back a second time and got seats at the tapas bar. Once again, members of the staff Paco (door) and Bilal (waiter) were super cordial. We had a lot of plates for sharing which were all good, but here are a few of the standouts: Grilled prawns, beef tenderloin w foie gras, almejas (clams), Pimentos de Padron, bacalao with honey, Huevos Cabreaos, jamon iberico, mushrooms …. And lastly do not forget: bread puddingNote: Sangria was a little too sweet for most of our tastes, so you might want to ask the waiter make it less sweet of stick to a nice bottle (or two) vino tinto o blanco. Please note they do NOT take reservations but staff is super efficient and it is worth the wait. Not sure of total seating capacity, but they have 2 inside areas as well as outside seating.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
653,17-08-2018 ,5.0,Food was absolutely delicious. The place had an awesome vibe and was packed. Service was good and efficient. We got there early and we’re lucky to only have to wait about 25 minutes but we’ll worth it. Get their early otherwise you’ll have some of a wait.
654,14-08-2018 ,5.0,"Been to Barcelona 7 times and recently discovered this place. Been here a few times and quality is always the same - A+. Food is great and staff are very friendly. They don't speak good English but at least they try and are extremely friendly even though they are very busy. Only negative is they dont accept reservations and queue can take up to 45 minutes. Other than that, great place, reasonable prices and great food. Would recommend to anyone who likes traditional Spanish tapas."
655,13-08-2018 ,5.0,We waited about 30 minutes for a table in this very lively bar. We weren't disappointed! The food was fantastic and came quickly even when we ordered more part way through the meal. My favourite was the roasted peppers and aubergine with grilled goats cheese - delicious. This was definitely my favourite restaurant of our week here.
656,12-08-2018 ,5.0,"To try real Spanish tapas you need to go to Cervecería Catalana! The food was sensational and the service beyond efficient! Don't be intimidated by the number of people, if they tell you in half hour you have a table it really means half an hour sharp; plus the food arrives to your table very fast after ordering - it's actually intriguing how do they manage do it! Recommend it 100%!! "
657,11-08-2018 ,5.0,"This place I could visit every day. So much to discover and all very tasty. Good service, adequate pricing, un-professional gate-keeper, but she could not lower the great experience of our senses. Mmmmmmh....!"
658,11-08-2018 ,1.0,"Having asked for a table for a large family of 12, we were giving a reservation at 8pm. Having arrived at 8pm to confirm the reservation, we were interrogated by the door staff about our reservation and they claimed we were not the same people who had originally made the reservation. They proceeded question who we were. They had ignored us and continued to take on other customers even though we confirmed the reservation name and number of people. Wouldn’t ever go back, attitude of the door staff was poor and embarrassing to say the least. If they didn’t want to take on a large group during a peak Time, they should never have given us a reservation in the first place. "
659,11-08-2018 ,1.0,Incredibly rude staff at the entrance of the restaurant. Accused us of trying to steal a table when we were trying to confirm our table was ready because we had kids with us who were not able to wait in the heat. Lady at the door was interrogating us about the details of our family when we told her if the table was ready we would call the remaining members of our group and they would be at the restaurant within 5 minutes. Avoid at all cost.
660,8-08-2018 ,5.0,"This is a very popular tapas restaurant for good reason. The tapas are excellent. The tables are a bit too close together for my liking. The waiters are a bit curt, probably because they are so busy. If you don't like to queue make sure you go early evening."
661,7-08-2018 ,5.0,"I used to live in Barcelona and went here often with friends, family, and visitors. The food and service were reliable and a good value for the money. I haven't been here for 10 years, so I wasn't sure about suggesting this as the place for our last meal in Barcelona, especially with both vegetarians and super carnivores. I'm so glad i did, as the food and service were just as i remembered. We arrived pretty early and scored an outside table."
662,7-08-2018 ,5.0,"Walking in I knew this was going to be a wonderful place. The bar lined with seafood and happy people drinking and eating was so inviting. This is the type of restaurant that makes you want to order everything you see going by. We were not disappointed. Padron peppers, octopus, hot dog - I don't remember it all, but it was all good."
663,6-08-2018 ,2.0,"We came here for our first lunch stop in Barcelona, merely due to the good reviews on Trip Advisor. Also the queue at the entrance seemed to be a good sign, the food displayed looked absolutely great and there where plenty of tapas to choose from. But once finally seated the dissapoinent moments came one after another. The merely Asian staff was unfriendly, pushing to place your order quickly and the tapas served only tasted mediocre at best... Some tapas where only served half an hour after the first dish and plates where removed again before you actually had put the food in your mouth. No clue what this has to do with authentic local tapas, this was just as below average as any place that rather aims for hurds of tourists than quality food! There are plenty of less hyped tapas restaurants in Barcelona that serve much better tapas in a far more friendly atmosphere!"
664,5-08-2018 ,4.0,We went here for an early tapas dinner and this place was buzzing. It is certainly not a place for a leisurely dinner but the food was great and made up for the push to get you in and out.
665,5-08-2018 ,5.0,"These are some of the best tapas in Barcelona. The queue is a bit long - might have to wait 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on time, but it's worth it. We had the fries with eggs, clams, the prawns, everything so tasty. Would come here again."
666,3-08-2018 ,5.0,"This place did not disappoint! Luckily since there was only 2 of us, the wait was less than 30 mins. But if you come here, give your self some time to be waiting for a table! The service is quick and friendly. Our waiter was super helpful and let know if we ordered too much food. Which we might have, but we didn’t regret any of it! The beef tenderloin with fois gras was probably my favorite and I’m not usually a fan of potatoes but they were really delicious! I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat!"
667,1-08-2018 ,5.0,"We recently visited this place while in vacation in Barcelona, the best tapas in Barcelona you can have. Atmosphere is great and the food is excellent. If you go expect to wait between 30 to 45 minutes for a table or if you don't mind you can sit at the bar one a sit comes available and that is faster that waiting for a table."
668,1-08-2018 ,5.0,"We were lucky enough to get a table here as soon as we arrived! Have heard it can me a half hour to an hour wait sometimes! Everything we had tasted amazing, it has mostly fish/shellfish dishes and good Patatas Bravas. Enjoyed it here"
669,1-08-2018 ,5.0,Finest Tapas restaurant visited by mass even on weekdays. Wil definitely visit again and eat all the delicious dishes by this famous restaurant
670,1-08-2018 ,5.0,"A must stop for any visitor to Barcelona. Food is to die for, and unlike some of the pushy restaurants on Las Ramblas this place what you're looking for when you're travelling to try a local restaurant. My wife was surprised that I found it :)."
671,31-07-2018 ,5.0,"My wife and I went to this place and everything we ate was fantastic. No matter what we ordered we enjoyed it and even saw other dishes at other tables and wanted to try them. Service is quick, food was fresh and price was great. I’ll be back."
672,31-07-2018 ,3.0,"I ate here with family in July and was well attended to by the hospitable staff despite being a large party without a reservation. This is a popular place and probably appears in multiple guidebooks, including some Japanese ones based on the clientele. I ordered a smattering of Spanish classics and found them done well, but I think I may have missed the boat by not ordering more fresh seafood which this place seems to have in abundance. Overall, it was a nice experience and a nice setting but I probably wouldn't plan to go again unless I were in the neighborhood."
673,30-07-2018 ,5.0,"This restaurant is next to my hotel Hotel Alexandra, and my doorman said it’s one of the best tapas restaurants in Barcelona. It is indeed awesome, which I came here twice a day, for lunch and dinner lol. My fav is definitely the beef tenderloin with foie gras. As you can see in the photo, this perfect combination makes it so juicy and it only cost me 5.95€ (price in July 2018). The second place is for razor clams since I can’t find them in California lol. As for the dessert, thanks to my bartender who recommended me the biscuit ice cream. It tastes like whiskey with caramel on top of ice cream (please correct me if I’m wrong). It was so amazingly good! This dessert deserves one star Michelin! LolSince I came here by myself, I didn’t have to wait but had no problem sitting at the bar immediately. But it’s worth it even if you have to wait for an hour. Totally worth it. "
674,29-07-2018 ,4.0,"The food was fantastic, we were lucky to get a table outside and enjoy the wonderful July evening watching passerby's while we ate. We ate clams (2 orders of the small clams and 1 order of razer clams), garlic shrimp, salad, and boquerones. All was delicious, one of the better meals in Barcelona and if you have been here, you know the food is great all over the city. The only complaint, this is NOT a cerveceria. They had one beer on tap, not even sure where it was from. I was looking forward to a some local brew, but otherwise, my wife and I went away very satisfied."
675,29-07-2018 ,5.0,"Well, we like to eat good food! Visited last week Barcelona and looked for some restaurants to fulfill our passion. This one was recommended by my cousin. What can we say, we returned here three times in the week, trying different things every time. Conclusion, an excellent cook, everything very well organized, very friendly staff, quick service and reasonable prices. Can't wait to come back!! Respect!"
676,25-07-2018 ,5.0,"They dont take reservations, you have to go there, sign up to the list and wait which in peak time can even be an hour. But it s all worth it!!! Excellent dishes, superb quality, fair prices."
677,22-07-2018 ,5.0,we stopped at lunch tine in this fabtastic cervezeria. we were eight and had very good food at a reasonable price. we took different tapas and all of them were fresh and good. professional service. a good place to stop in barcellona near the ramblas.
678,22-07-2018 ,5.0,"We stopped by three different times and there was always a line day and night. We ended up coming closer to closing time (I think they close at midnight and we arrived at 10:45 and the wait was shorter) and were seated in about 15 minutes. The food is delicious, everything is so fresh. The restaurant itself is modern décor with enormous flowers that are real and stunningly gorgeous. I would wait in line again just to eat here."
679,21-07-2018 ,1.0,"After our experience, we cannot understand why this restaurant has such high reviews. The wait to get in is lengthy, the service is atrocious and the food is overpriced for very below average quality and quantity. While the hostesses were lovely, once in the servers were rude, impatient and not at all helpful or interested in the diner's experience. The portions were small and the food was ordinary at best. This restaurant while it has a good reputation online it is unclear what this is based on. This is one for people to go to be seen but the food is nothing to write home about and the servers do not seem interested in the customer experience. In addition cleanliness needs to be looked at as we had to return our plates, cutlery and glasses as all were dirty. There are much better value for money and experience tapas restaurants a few steps up the road."
680,20-07-2018 ,5.0,"We tried beef mini hamburger, lamb and tenderloin with tomato bread. Please try tenderloin with tomato bread. Delicious!"
681,20-07-2018 ,5.0,"We loved this place. You can order from any waiter- no trying to find and flag down your 'server'. The food was excellent. The cod with ailoli & honey was out of the stratosphere. Great location, buzzy atmosphere."
682,19-07-2018 ,5.0,"We were looking to have a late night dinner and nothing was opened and a lady told us to go there! It was very nice! The service was great, the waiters were lovely and the food was absolutely delicious! Highly recommended "
683,18-07-2018 ,5.0,What a wonderful array of tapas. Just sit-in at the bar and watching all of the amazing dishes appear from the kitchen is a treat in itself! Order from the display or the printed menu or just point to some amazing looking plate that someone else is enjoying and say I want that. The steak tenderloin with foie gras is one of the best things I ever tasted.
684,18-07-2018 ,2.0,Went for a late dinner. The staff were very rude and not welcoming. The only plus point is that they are open till late and food is average. Only the chicken salad was good. 
685,15-07-2018 ,4.0,Always complete inside. Stay at the bar for a good service. Nice place to meet people!!Friendly waiters and quality tapas specially the hot bar with the lomito and foie montadito!!
686,14-07-2018 ,3.0,"We dined here based on a local's recommendation. What a disappointment. It was full of tourists which should have been the first sign to leave. The tapas were totally unimaginative. We've been in Spain for 2 weeks and had the pleasure to eat in many restaurants with delicious local food, creatively prepared. This restaurant did not offer that. Cost was reasonable, and food was fair at best. Service was fast, but unfriendly."
687,14-07-2018 ,5.0,It’s fantastic! The cod my favorite. Everything was D-Lish. Now my all-time absolute favorite tapas restaurant ever. Go get ya some. :)
688,13-07-2018 ,5.0,"We have been to this restaurant many times and were never disappointed. Service is professional, waiters usually have good recommendations as to food and wine. Long lineups during prime dinner time but we don't mind as we have a drink at the bar while we wait for our table. Great tapas and desserts, the kids loved the mini burgers."
689,13-07-2018 ,4.0,"Went there straight from the airport upon recommendation, sat outside but the inside part is far more charming. Fresh tapas and very quick service"
690,12-07-2018 ,5.0,"We went there at around 11PM and the place was still full. The tapas were amazing, the service was pretty good. I especially would recommend the churros. There are a lot of vegetarian options too. "
691,12-07-2018 ,5.0,"While living in Barcelona a few years ago discovered this restaurant and it quickly became my go to for tapas. Every time I’m back in the city I visit at least once and it never disappoints. Always recommend to friends and family while visiting and receive great feedback! It is a busy restaurant and doesn’t accept reservations. Be prepared to wait up to 90 mins for a table but it is well worth it. Enjoy a glass of house wine while you wait and soak up the atmosphere and eye up all the dishes you’ll order when you’re seated. Try the huevos cabreos and veal, delicious! "
692,12-07-2018 ,5.0,"My girlfriend and I ate there last night and can’t speak highly enough of the quick efficient service, unbelievable food, the speed of the food service and the cost of it all. We had 2 drinks each, more Tapas than we could handle (as it was so delicious) and 2 deserts for just over €50. It is was also commendable to see they had a member of their waitstaff team with an intellectual disability. She did a great job and it is great to see this awesome restaurant giving equal opportunity to people with disabilities as this is definitely not the norm in the Western world."
693,11-07-2018 ,5.0,"My friends and I visited three different tapas restaurants in Barcelona over 6 nights and this was by far the best.We visited twice, waiting around 40 minutes both nights for a table, but the helpful staff, the sangria and the impending delicious food was definitely worth the wait.Also, a meal with 5-6 different tapas foods AND desert came to €20 euros each for 4 friends. AMAZING STEAL.Anyone in the Gracia area MUST come and eat here."
694,11-07-2018 ,5.0,"The place is really cute and nice , I was actually at the counter and I enjoyed it probably more than being seated at a table - a lot of good food choice, fresh fish to pick from and served really quickly .... Very good food quality level .... and also great wines - to remember for sure on our next trip to Barcelona-People working there are fast and very kind ....We will be back ! Thanks"
695,11-07-2018 ,5.0,"We had a great time and had a real culinary experience. If you are in Spain and want to try tapas, that is your place. My personal recommendation is Camembert crispy. That was super delicious."
696,11-07-2018 ,5.0,The number of different Tapas that you could order was very extensive. We tried several dishes and were pleased with all our selections
697,9-07-2018 ,5.0,"This place was recommended to us by our friends. My family stayed behind a few days after our tour to walk around Barcelona and enjoy some local food since guided tours don't always bring us to local food places. The food here is amazing, the dishes aren't too small but portioned so that we can try a good variety. The waiter was friendly and spoke english and took the time to explain to us which one he personally loves and what is popular. Definitely one of the most memorable food experiences in Barcelona. "
698,9-07-2018 ,4.0,"This restaurant is great for tapas, but the queues can be very long at prak times. It can sometimes be quicker to sit at the bar rather than the dining tables. There is a great choice of tapas and it's delicious"
699,9-07-2018 ,4.0,"The place was packed! We had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table and when we got to our table, it didn't disappoint. The menu was extensive and not being very fluent in either spanish or catalan, ordering food was quite an adventure. But the ones that we had (we picked seafood quite a lot) was wonderful. I remember having the calamaris and they were heavenly. Definitely aim for the tapas and the pintxos. You won't be disappointed."
700,7-07-2018 ,5.0,"Not enough kind words can be said. They should focus more on the meat than the gross seafood. Some of it is pretty out there, but the restaurant as a whole is terrific. "
701,7-07-2018 ,4.0,"One of the must emblematic restaurant in Barcelona. We order the huevos cabreados, Russian salad, fried fish with padrón peppers, Spanish tortilla and the solomillo tapas, also for dessert we order the Catalan cream and the churros, everything was really good and service is great!!!"
702,6-07-2018 ,5.0,"best octopus I had in my life. Everything else is very good too. We had prawns, tortilla, green hot peppers, patatas bravas (potatos with a very nice sauce), bread with tomatoes and pulpo a la plancha 9grilled octopus). Great. 15 minutes wait for a table and the service was quick and efficient. will be there tomorrow."
703,6-07-2018 ,5.0,"Visited this tapas restaurant in Barcelona based on a recommendation from our hotel's manager - what an excellent recommendation! The daily Tapas menu was available in English and our waiter reviewed the choices with us and gave us some great recommendations - Grilled octopus, garlic prawns, fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey (have to try this one), prawns and scallops, and the list goes on and on ... Great prices and it all went down with either a half-liter or full liter of your favorite Sangria - if you are in Barcelona looking for the local flavor - hit this place at least once (we hit it twice for dinner in four nights)!"
704,5-07-2018 ,5.0,"Visited Cerveceria Catalana first time in 2007. It's still the best place for Tapas in BCN. Try the Iberico ham, prawn skewers, Beef tenderloin, patatas bravas....."
705,3-07-2018 ,4.0,"The tapas were delicious and the sangria hit the spot. I enjoyed the four cheese mini pizza — which is a diagonal slice of bread with a stack of four cheeses and then slice of tomato with a sprinkling of oregano. The patatas bravas arrived piping hot and were not drowning in an excess of cheap mayo. This is one of the few restaurants where they did not use grocery store Tabasco sauce to add spicy kick to the potatoes. I actually make their own spicy sauce.My son loved the mini burgers. My husband said that the calamari served fresh and hot was great. The first plate of calamari arrived cold. And when my husband notify the waiter, the waiter immediately apologized and took it away. He brought over a very hot plate of calamari that my husband said was very, very good.The olives had a perfect texture with the right amount of saltiness and served in a splash of quality olive oil. The best tomato bread I had in all of Spain was probably at this restaurant.For dessert ordered apple tart and churros with chocolate. What can I say? Both were the perfect size and the tartness of the apples balanced out the richness of the churros and chocolate. So eating a little of both ended our meal on a high note.They were so much more I wanted to try but I was too full. If we had another day in Barcelona, would have returned."
706,3-07-2018 ,5.0,"Although the food isn't anything remarkable, Cerveceria Catalana offers a variety of local favorites at reasonable prices, as well as outdoor seating and a trendy atmosphere. Make sure to book a table or get there early to ensure they are able to seat you. The sangria is good, and you can order it by the pitcher, and you can never go wrong with manchego and jamon serrano."
707,3-07-2018 ,5.0,"EEEExcellent.They have a daily meal that includes a drink, main and dessert for 12 Euros. Off the beaten track, but well worth it; a neighbourhood place."
708,3-07-2018 ,5.0,My husband and I enjoyed a delicious meal of tapas here. Fun atmosphere and good service. The fried Camembert was like dessert!
709,1-07-2018 ,3.0,"Our friend group of six went here to celebrate a birthday. This beautiful tapas bar has the most amazing buffet displays of fresh seafood, pinxtos , and other offerings of any place we visited during our week in Barcelona. It's extremely popular so go early or get reservations. We planned in advance to ensure we could have a lovely evening.We were seated and began ordering wine and pinxtos and one of friends got up to go to the ladies room and discovered her purse had been swiped off the back of her chair!!When we called the servers over, they said that this sort of thing has happened there many times and they try to warn people not to put their purses or phones within grabbing reach. The oddest part of it was that her chair was rather far from the walking aisle, so none of us knew how it happened. To make it worse, the restaurant has two doors, a front door and a back exit onto the sidewalk, which makes it perfectly set up for petty thiefs to swipe things and slip out undetected. Our friend left crying and the entire event ruined our dinner. The few things we had previously ordered were consumed at a table of sad friends. Our friend then had to spend four hours the next day filing a police report so that her home insurance claim would be valid and she had to cancel her credit card and phone. If you go, be very careful and ask the restaurant to put security at the doors!!!"
710,29-06-2018 ,4.0,"thesre was a very long queue with a 40 minutes wait the first time, the second time we have to wait 20 minutes,but with good tapas at this price range.....you are guaranteed to have a queue....very good food and good service...recommended"
711,28-06-2018 ,5.0,This is a bit of an institution in Barcelona and as a result gets very crowded.That said the food is still fantastic .Take your time wait for a table outside or find a good seat(not easy at the bar.Taking time is the key try some small dishes and watch wait and see as the counter dishes are replaced you will soon get into the swing of things and keep ordering.The wine offering is very good we had Rose and a lovely dry house white.If you don't want to sit at the bar or outside there is a big room not easily see from the street so go in put your name down and wait to be called it wont take long.ECDLondon
712,27-06-2018 ,4.0,"Fantastic tapas and drinks but its a shame that the service is to fast. Lot's of beer brands and the sangria is great.You have to go very early to get a table, otherwise you have to wait more than one hour.We enjoy it a lot and we will go back for sure"
713,26-06-2018 ,4.0,"5 days in Barcelona and those big lines waiting on that place... I had to try it before leaving, the last day before leaving at lunch, what a surprise! Nobody waiting... We got in, and had a wine and a variety of tapas... so delicious!!!"
714,25-06-2018 ,5.0,"This place is more than perfect , food is so tasty . As a foreigner I didn’t understand much of the food names so I depended on the staff recommendation which was beyond expectations. Loved it so much."
715,25-06-2018 ,4.0,"Good place for some cold (very cold) beers! We had a reservstion, I think is a must, because the place is crowded. Tapas are good, but I was there for beers and some relax. Prices are a little bit higher then expected. After some beers it doesn't seem to be a problem, anyway!"
716,24-06-2018 ,4.0,"I went to this restaurant today, and ordered 4 tapas, 1 L of sangria, and a bottle of beer. One of the tapas I ordered (mushroom and asparagus) was too salty for me and my companions to finish eating, which was a huge disappointment. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, though the waitress at the front initially came off as a bit rude (maybe because they were so busy?)They don't have the sangria (half a liter and a full liter) on the menu, but the price when I went was 11 euros for the former and 17 euros for the latter."
717,24-06-2018 ,1.0,"We wanted to visit this bar, it looked great. There was a free table for 4 outside so we asked the waiter if we can sit there. He replied he needs to check with his colleague because we are only 2. After five minutes his female colleague brought menus and took us to the table. After another three minutes she came back saying we have to leave because there is some big mama who “was there earlier than us.” Probably some of her friends or what. The female waiter did not even offered us table inside (there were many free tables). Simply disgusting."
718,23-06-2018 ,5.0,"From the first second you walk in, the dazzling array of hot on the left, and cold on the right is mesmerizing. What to have first ??!! Sit at the bar ( great people watching ), ask for a glass of wine, and start pointing. Not too fast or you'll fill up before you've sampled enough. Take your time and enjoy. A bustling, boisterous venue, great food and drink, terrifically fare prices. Busy as could be at the ""usual times "", but always worth the wait - always. "
719,23-06-2018 ,5.0,This is our second time in Barcelona and after being recommend this place on the first visit (6 years ago we went there 3 times) we thought we’d head back as it was so good on the first trip. We arrived at about 8 on a Thursday evening and was told the wait was 45 mins which to be fair shows how popular the place is. As you’re waiting it seems a bit chaotic as people are standing around the entrance as the waiters are coming in and out trying to do their jobs and people are in the way......they have more patients than me It was as good as I remember and would definitely recommend even though it was busy we never felt rushed and stayed for an hour or so which was ample time to eat and relax afterwards. 
720,21-06-2018 ,5.0,"If you are ok with a bit of a wait at popular times, this is a must. If you can eat earlier than normal Spanish times, there will be less of a wait. Probably less of a wait for lunch than for dinner as well. Consistent traditional tapas quality with good service. Enjoy!"
721,19-06-2018 ,4.0,"Before going to Barcelona I was recommended a visit to Cerveceria Catalana. So had a lot of other people because the restaurant was generally packed with people queuing up outside. In general it is not possible to book a table in advance. We were able to get an outside table after talking to one of the waiters. He put us on a ""waiting list"" and asked us to return in 20 minutes. The food was very good and we had a very enjoyable evening."
722,19-06-2018 ,5.0,Been to Barcelona a number of times and we always make sure to visit. the food and atmosphere are just lovely. it's great value and decent local wine 
723,18-06-2018 ,5.0,"Ok I have eaten tapas before, but this.... this is really next level!!!!I have read on TripAdvisor of this place and was determined to go, and what a joy!I cannot tell you enough how crazy you are if you are in Barca and not going to this place, the service is sooooo good.We were here at around 19.00 and the place was packed, we and 3 groups before us have wait about 5 minutes and then we could sit at a table.We were with 4 (me, my wife and our 2 kids 4 and 3).The waiter was so kind and informed us about the best options.After we ordered the food came really fast, the first one within a couple of minutes.We also ordered the Sangria which come in 0,5 or 1 liter. We ordered the 0,5 because only my wife was drinking it (ok I had a glass as well) so good!Like I said the food is so good, flavored and perfect.Please do not leave Barca before you been here!O yeah when we left @around 20.30 the people were standing outside. We asked about the waiting time and it was over 1 hour. So be prepared!"
724,17-06-2018 ,5.0,"We have eaten here many, many times. We have never had a bad dish. Everything from slider hamburgers, sepia, fried calamari,Tomatoes and feta cheese, and many more dishes."
725,17-06-2018 ,3.0,We went there for dinner recently; the food was nice however the bar tenders and staff at the entrance allocating tables really need to work on their customer service. Seriously. I haven't come across a ruder person in Europe than the lady at the door allocating tables.
726,13-06-2018 ,5.0,"Bustling tapas bar and restaurant. Delicious food, big menu with specials available, as well. We waited a bit, as expected, but no problem walking around the area while waiting. Service was very friendly and welcoming, helpful with menu, etc. Lots of large groups, families as well as adults. Fun place."
727,13-06-2018 ,5.0,"We loved this restaurant, very attentive and excellent food & drink.I would go back there again !!!"
728,10-06-2018 ,4.0,We went for breakfast every morning and always busy many locals but good morning tapas eggs coffee oj. Prompt service helpful. Will return.
729,10-06-2018 ,5.0,"The first time we attempted to eat here we had stumbled upon it ourselves not reading reviews and decided against the 45 min wait as we were very hungry but after seeing the queues we though we better read reviews as it must be good. Last night we were prepared for a long wait but were surprised by only a 5 min wait. Lovely ambience , it’s a big restaurant and all the staff are very helpful. We let our waiter order for us. Sometimes I’m against this as I worry that they will recommend all the really expensive dishes but don’t worry he didn’t. Every dish we had was so delicious , so much flavor and very well cooked- he recommend 5 tapas plates for 2 people. Even though there were plenty of people waiting for tables not once did we feel rushed by them to get us out. I would highly recommend you visit this restaurant when in Barcelona. "
730,8-06-2018 ,2.0,"We arrived at 7,30om and were lucky to get a table straight away. My friend had her hadbag over the arm of her chair. the waiter said move it to the other side which she did. Well you guessed it, an hour or so later it was missing. The waiter said ""I told you to put it on the floor between you"". He did NOT make that clear. He was not surprised when we called him over. we searched garbage bins for many streets around. So BEWARE SECURITY!"
731,6-06-2018 ,5.0,"My first few meals in bcn was satisfied by this restaurant. Ate alot and all taste delicious. Do go early to avoid queuing, u won’t be disappointed."
732,5-06-2018 ,5.0,"Excellent food with great service. Had reservations for 8 which they easily accommodated. Went early around 7:30 as we heard it would be less crowded. When we left at 9:30, it was packed as the locals tend to eat dinner at a later hour. Would highly recommend. "
733,5-06-2018 ,1.0,Was overcharged with IVA scam. Made literally 4 steps from the table when I realized I left my camera on my seat. Turned around and the waiters were hiding it instead of following me to return it... They did return it after a very uncomfortable few seconds but that type of tourist is a jerk who should be ripped off is just wrong.
734,4-06-2018 ,5.0,The food is perfect and the cava pairs great with the tapas. Every time we are in Barcelona we try to have at least one meal here. we love it! 
735,4-06-2018 ,5.0,"Amazing tapas, seafood selection is great, stuff very friendly, the bar is a better experience then the table especially if you don’t know what to eat"
736,30-05-2018 ,5.0,"It's a big restaurant With very good Food (Especially Seafood) but it's normally crowded. Get there with patience and wait for a table, no reservation is accepted by now. "
737,29-05-2018 ,5.0,"Amazing selection of tapas! Great food overall, everything we tried was excellent. ~30€ with two bottles of wine!"
738,29-05-2018 ,4.0,Excellent Tapas. It is always crowded. I came few times and always find the food is excellent. Sitting in the Tapas Bar is always nice especially the waitress and waiter are friendly to offer and recommend good tapas. Wines are nice as well. Will always comeback for lunch or dinner whenever I am in Barcelona.
739,28-05-2018 ,5.0,"Excellent quality, you can see it and taste in every meal.Excellent attention and very fast service.You have to go in advance because there is always line and people waiting and putting their names in the list. Do not go hungry."
740,27-05-2018 ,3.0,"This is a good introductory place to enjoy tapas. They have the basics down for sure. However, in comparison to other Barcelona Tapas bar the Catalana does pale in comparison. What it does have going for it is the amazing service from their hostess to their servers. They work as a team and help each other out so that the service is fast and efficient. Catalana is very reasonably priced for the amount of tapas you could try. This place is very popular with tourists. They are open all day without the customary siesta break. If you have flexible dining hours I would suggest coming between 6-7pm to avoid a wait since they do not take reservations. "
741,27-05-2018 ,4.0,"If you come during dinner time it is really busy, but it is really nice tapas. I think way better tapas than a lot of other places. It is touristic, but the locals also come here to eat. The tapas del dia is not translated in english, but worth looking though, as some really nice tapas dishes are in the list. Just google them and look at the images;)"
742,27-05-2018 ,4.0,We had high expectations from the constant queues outside. Food was good.. lots of options.... but a little too busy for my liking.... we sat at bar and so busy we had rucksacks and elbows in our backs. Book a table and i think it would be better or expect the frenzy and eat at the bar
743,25-05-2018 ,1.0,"I have no idea what the food tastes like but I know for sure the customer service tasted awful. I reached the place at 630pm and like an obedient schoolboy, I stood in the queue. While waiting to be attended to, I witnessed the Maitre d accusing a family of not answering her when their names were called.I continued to wait for the Maitre d to attend to me but she doesn't seem to have noticed me even though I was standing right in front of her. Finally, I approached her and politely asked to have my name added to the waitlist.Her response was not what I expected. instead of asking for my name, she shouted, ""I don't know if you are on the list or not. Did you come in to add your name? Don't know how to put you on the list if you didn't come in"".Am I not asking her now? Well, I don't need this and I definitely don't deserve this kind of treatment.I just moved on to another restaurant."
744,25-05-2018 ,4.0,"We ordered a half bottle of rose, Squid Catalan, Aparagus with Mushrooms, Patatas Bravas, Hot Peppers, Grilled Prawns, Clams, Croquettes and Beef Steak.All wonderful. Great service and surroundings. €60 for two."
745,22-05-2018 ,5.0,This restaurant had tasty tapas and burgers. There was a good selection of food for both the more adventurous visitor as well as those wanting more familiar food. This was ideal for our family. Also helpful was the English/Spanish menu.
746,22-05-2018 ,5.0,"Very good variety and the waiters are super helpful with deciding. The churros and seafood was great. They spike the sangria, so always a good call. Don’t be discouraged by the always lengthy waitlist. It doesn’t take too long to get in as it is a big restaurant. "
747,17-05-2018 ,4.0,Very nice and accomodating staff. Food was excellent.Short waiting time and very pricy. Do not miss!
748,17-05-2018 ,5.0,"My first trip to Europe and our first stop was Barcelona. This place was recommended as a ""MUST"" by several friends who have visited Barcelona in the past, as well as my son, who took me on this trip. Not knowing what exactly Tapas were, this was definitely the place to show me. My son ordered several different dishes and asked me to eat slow, taste and enjoy the food and observe the many flavor profiles the food. Various meats, vegetable and sea food dishes came out in small portions on small plates, which led me to believe that I was going to leave this place hungry. Wow! Not only was my appetite satisfied, I think I discovered taste buds on my tongue that have never been used before. Some of the dishes were simple as others were a bit more complex and BTW, you have to complement the meal with Sangria. All were amazing!I finished off my meal with dessert and a cappuccino. My eyes rolled as I was thinking, ""this might be the best meal I have ever had."" This place is a definite MUST for anyone visiting Barcelona."
749,16-05-2018 ,5.0,"The tapas were very delicious and the sangria was so tasty that we ate there two consecutive nights! Food portions were so generous that three plates afforded enough food for three women. We declined dessert because we were full. The hostess and servers were attentive and prompt, yet they allowed us to linger over our food despite the crowds. Service, food, and value are all 5 stars."
750,16-05-2018 ,1.0,"This is *that* restaurant that we haven't stopped talking about for the past 15 years. The food was absolutely amazing to the point that we went twice when we were in Barcelona and completely gorged ourselves on the amazing tapas. At the time there was a long wait of mostly locals.Sadly, fast forward to today and nothing about this place is the same. They have expanded the restaurant so it's now about 3 times the size and everyone from wait staff to diners were from elsewhere. But we persevered because the food was that incredible on our last visit. One look at the menu and my husband wanted to leave but I insisted on giving it a try. I rarely admit I should listen to him but he was absolutely correct. All that was left on the menu were mediocre at best selections including a salad that was supposedly a pasta salad with bow tie pasta and bland avocado. I have never left a tapas restaurant this disappointed and not completely stuffed.I'm not sure where the glowing reviews are coming from but we had better tapas just walking into a place across from the Palau de la Música which is surprising because typically in such a high traffic tourist area the food can be expected to be middle of the road."
751,16-05-2018 ,2.0,"I can't quite understand why this place is still getting great reviews. My wife and I visited 10 years ago, and we loved it. The place was smaller, and much more authentic then, with a much livelier bar area, and honestly, much, much better food. We were excited about returning this trip, but things seemed off from the first moment we entered. The place was fairly empty (it was early, yes, but I have never seen it even remotely empty before). And then the food. We started with several dishes, which were all mediocre at best, and some were just bad (the California Salad was particularly uninspired). It is the first time I have ever been to a tapas restaurant where we left food on the plates, and in this case, we left a lot of food on the plates. Maybe we were too enthusiastic in our memory of the place, but we had just eaten the night before at Tapeo, which was infinitely better. Lots of tourists here now, no Spanish, which was also a dead giveaway. I recommend you find something smaller, and with better food."
752,15-05-2018 ,5.0,"Recommend everything in the photo except the avocado salad (avocado was too raw and plain for my tastebud). Fried cheese with peanuts (heavenly), prawns (my favorite), and liver & steak tapa (brilliant combo) are must tries. Came here by myself so found a seat pretty quickly around 1p at the bar. Larger parties have a long wait but definitely worth it. Highly recommend! "
753,15-05-2018 ,5.0,"As far as Tapas is concerned, this place is seriously good. It’s more upmarket than the standard walk-in tapas bar. In fact, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to simply walk in as depending on the hour, this place is busy. However, if you don’t mind sharing a table - (recommend this as is very spacious and hardly considered sharing), then you won’t need to wait long. A little higher priced but worth it."
754,13-05-2018 ,5.0,"This location is a must for tapas, you can also sit down and have a meal. We sat at the bar and had a great time with the servers, the food and the wine. Tapas were all great, we followed the guidance of Sergio who recommended the best options. The solomillo toast with pate is amazing, the Spanish tortilla too and the ham and cheese grilled croissant. Local wine selection was very good.We walked in before dinner (8 pm) and had no problem to find space at the bar, terrace was fool and eventually the restaurant got busy too. It is not far from La Pedrera."
755,13-05-2018 ,4.0,"Optimal location, downtown Barcelona. Nice interior, with a long counter, well equipped with tasty tapas.Although the restaurant is pretty touristic, it does not loose a genuine, and traditional appeal.Excellent tapas, all freshly prepared with local ingredients.Service is quick and cheerful.As no reservations are possible, be prepared to relatively-long waiting time (especially around ""rush"" hours).Good prices (perhaps a bit costly for ""just"" tapas)."
756,12-05-2018 ,5.0,"Really nice place to visit. Food is very good, for lunch or dinner. Independently if you get regular tables or balcony. Very good option "
757,11-05-2018 ,4.0,"Great atmosphere ,always busy and crowded with long line ups for people to get in.Excellent and patient service....if you are not sure what is in the menu...just bring the waiter to the front display and point at what you want. Delicious tapas of every kind."
758,10-05-2018 ,5.0,"The wait was as we were told, 45 minutes but worth every second!!! The service was great and the food was magical. Highly recommend the fried artichokes, calamari, mushrooms and asparagus, croquettes, fried Camembert, sangria, 3 texture chocolate and Catalan ice cream. The prices were also very reasonable. "
759,8-05-2018 ,4.0,"looking for a place to dinner like a Catalan, tapas and beer we found this restaurant always full of people and close to our Hotel. It's a good option and not too expensive."
760,8-05-2018 ,3.0,More than an hour queueing for a food that is average at best. Prices were ok. Service was excellent. 
761,8-05-2018 ,4.0,"Best things is its quite fast , its in hearts of city and alwayes busy . Overall i wud say decent and not that expensive . "
762,7-05-2018 ,5.0,"Very beautiful place and very very busy... Great ambience went there without booking, you might have to wait a bit but is worthed, The food is very tasty and fresh, my recommendation will be at least 6 plates per person to get full. Of course for bill will not be the smallest one and neither the biggest ever, but keep in mind is centre of Barcelona. They have a terrace as well ( not recommended in the windy days )"
763,6-05-2018 ,5.0,"We visited the place this May, it was recommended to us by some friends. The hostess' response was swift and she found us a table immediately, even though we didn't have a reservation. We were more than impressed by the food. The plates were very tasty and hearty and the wine list was very satisfying. We will definitely eat there again on our next visit!"
764,6-05-2018 ,5.0,"I was not here for a few years and I am still excited, that despite the little expansion and the new interior design ....the tapas and the service is still on this fantasitic level that made this place to my favourite place in town.You must try this place ignoring to line up for a few minutes to get a table ....its worth ist!"
765,5-05-2018 ,5.0,"This is one of the best places to go for tapas. There is a large selection and variety. And, they are consistently excellent. Be prepared to wait in line."
766,5-05-2018 ,5.0,"The location is great and the food as well.Also, the people are very friendly.The octopus and the shrimps were amazing. "
767,2-05-2018 ,5.0,"A trendy, lively, attractive tapas restaurant in the Eixample. Great food - from the classic to the creative - coupled with fast and courteous service."
768,1-05-2018 ,5.0,An endless display of eatable works of art.. So beautiful and delicious..and then there is still a menu to order from..Really enjoyed ever bite..
769,30-04-2018 ,5.0,"The food is amazing and the waiters are super friendly. It’s always busy so it may take some time to get a table, but it’s definitely worth the wait. "
770,30-04-2018 ,5.0,"We always come here when in Barcelona. So professional from the Asian customer greeter to the waiting staff an chefs. The food is top quality an such a selection. Emphasis on seafood, but good selection of meats an veggies. The sangria is one of the best I have had in Spain. They also do a tapa version of desserts. Always busy for a reason Exellent. Again I think the hostess is hot. "
771,30-04-2018 ,5.0,Come early around 5+pm if you don’t want disappointment. We had the freshest delectable steamed prawns & razor clams ever!! The portions were considered value for money compared to other Tapas joints + they serve hot food as well. 
772,29-04-2018 ,2.0,...until it got in all the tourist guides. It is now totally overcrowded. It lost all its charm. Became big. Quality is still brilliant. But feels you are in a foof factory.
773,29-04-2018 ,5.0,We made various attempts to dine at this restaurant. There was always a line. We realized 6-7pm is the best time to go. We made sure our last dinner in Barcelona was here as we liked it soooo much!People say it’s a tourist trap but I would say it’s a tourist trap for a reason. The food and service are excellent! I’d go back again when I am in Barcelona.
774,29-04-2018 ,5.0,"You will have to wait for a table but it’s worth it. Fantastic meal, wine and service. We had to wait 90 minutes but that was fine as we just went for a few drinks at a bar round the corner.Get the assorted tapas as it’s great value for 16 euros. The grilled prawns and beef were sublime.Would definitely recommend "
775,27-04-2018 ,5.0,"Such a delicious meal, definitely goes down as one of the most amazing meals we have ever had. It was fantastic, enjoyed it all! "
776,26-04-2018 ,4.0,"Really really really delicious highly recommended patatas bravas, fried green pepper, escalavida with goat cheese, asparagus and mushroom"
777,25-04-2018 ,5.0,"This tapas bar is fabulous. Busy? Yes - lots of locals. It's that good and authentic. The staff will work hard to seat you as soon as they can. Look at the pix submitted here (by others) - makes me want to book another Barcelona trip just so I can eat here! I particularly liked the pescadito frito (fried little fish) with peppers, razor clams and a dish of french fries and soft-cooked eggs tossed tableside. We would look at the dishes on surrounding tables & tell our waiter to bring us the same. Also liked the Habla del Silencio red wine."
778,25-04-2018 ,4.0,Enjoyed our tapas very much. Food came out quickly and service was pleasant and efficient. I had a cod dish also tuna with anchovies and roasted red peppers. Very delicious. We also had the ham on crusty bread.
779,24-04-2018 ,4.0,"I'd heard a lot about this place, all raving about the amazing food, so the expectations were high. The food really was great, but I'm not sure I'd wait in very long queues. Luckily for us, the queue moved quickly and we were seated in about 15 mins - at peak time, this really wasn't a very long wait. The bread was really good, and the calamari was exceptional, but the fish tapas wasn't good at all. Too slimy, I think it was undercooked :(Overall, I would recommend this restaurant. The prices are fair and food is good."
780,24-04-2018 ,5.0,"We were looking for a great place to have tapas and our hotel concierge sent us over here.We arrived around 8, but as it was Sant Jordi day (April 23) the place was packed. The hostess took our name, told us 45 min cut to check back in 30 just in case. After some time browsing book stalls that were shoulder to shoulder with people we stopped back (around 25 min) and were seated right away.This place is always busy according to the servers and they don’t take reservations. However they are experts in cleaning tables and turning them -looked to me to be just 3-4 minutes from when a party left until another was seated.Once we started ordering food it was obvious why they are popular-amazing food. We enjoyed a number of items including fried peppers, beef tenderloin tapas, shrimp in oil, tiny mini burgers-even smaller than sliders and our favorite Camembert cheese coated in chopped peanuts with a drizzle of raspberry sauce. Of course we had to have churros with chocolate for dessert.Fast friendly service is there hallmark with English menus and English speaking servers.Definitely worth a wait."
781,23-04-2018 ,5.0,"Found this restaurant in a travel book we had! My word, it was a great pick! Was extremely busy, which can only mean one thing!! we waited for our table, there isn't much room to wait, and is a bit hussle and bussle as youre literally stood in the way or on the street till your names called out for your table! That being said they were so much but managed to seat people pretty quickly!Service was quick, almost too quick and we didnt understand how to order, you can go to the bar and 'pick' your tapas with your waiter! Mum ordered 'some things!' but they were all GREAT choices. 5 of us there, all shared and tried all the things mum ordered. Delicious!! not massive seafood fans so mostly, beef, fish or vegetable dishes all sensational!! Potatas Bravas were DELICIOUS and the beef tenders! Dads favourite restaurant of our whole trip!!"
782,22-04-2018 ,5.0,Recommended by and near to Majestic Hotel. Heavenly food! Every bite was savored. Wonderful! Service was efficient which some may interpret as cold but I do not. Very pleased. It helped we showed up around 4:30 so no crowds. Perfect! 
783,21-04-2018 ,5.0,OMG... this food was divine! We waited 45 mins for a table and it was WORTH it! You will not regret it.
784,20-04-2018 ,3.0,"I stayed somewhere nearby this restaurant and saw it was full everynight, so I decided to have an early lunch before im leaving. Price is quite reasonable for tapas platter (16.5euro), but the food is already cold when it is served... Orange juice is too sweet as well... i dont know whether they could offer a better dinner experience, but definately wont recommend lunch there."
785,20-04-2018 ,1.0,"Visited this place based on numerous good reviews. When we arrived it was absolutely full to bursting, without any staff available to explain what was going on. We eventually got some seats at the counter (by basically standing right on top of people who we thought were about to leave). The food is okay - just okay - if you have a half decent tapas restaurant near you in the UK then this place won’t be any better. The service was very poor and the waiter charged us for two beers we hadn’t had. We’d ordered about 8 beers but only two actually arrived in the time we were there due to how busy and inattentive the waiter was. Overall, not the enjoyable, authentic or relaxing experience we were hoping for. "
786,19-04-2018 ,5.0,"If You want a genuine Spanish tapas experience, choose a place the locals flock to. And this place opens early and closes very late, but it’s best for a dinner or lunch experience. The cabreao egg dish is a must as is the mini hamburger. Don’t question it! The beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth. Wash it all down with a glass of sangria. Divine!!!"
787,19-04-2018 ,5.0,Best tapas I've ever eaten! Really really authentic - the customers are mostly natives! The tortilla is a must! Highly recommend!
788,17-04-2018 ,4.0,"Stopped here for a quick lunch, as it's conveniently located to some local sights. The tapas and service were both good, sadly, we didn't get to try any of their beers."
789,17-04-2018 ,3.0,"Nice restaurant with a good menu and good vibe. My only critique is that the staff obviously try to get you in and out as quickly as possible. They’re trying to turn tables as fast as they can to meet the demand, and you’ll feel it. "
790,15-04-2018 ,3.0,"The food was pretty good. Not amazing, we had better tapas at other places. The comfort factor was bad - too crowded, very small space between the tables of different guests, noisy. The main menu is available in English, but the big daily dishes/daily tapas list is not. Some waiters don't speak English at all.In short, this is a place with good food, but not good enough to put up with the lack of personal space and other smaller issues."
791,15-04-2018 ,4.0,"They please is tasty with amazing service. We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday. You can sit inside, outside or at the bar; our wait was about 15/20. We had about 6 items along with a pitcher of sangría. I definitely would recommend the tomato bread because it is a good companion to any tapa you get. My top 3 dishes were the fried artichoke, salmon w/ garlic mayo alioli & the fritas con huevos (fries w/ egg & tomato sauce). Our bill was 58€ so aprox. $80. The meal was more than enough for 2. I gave this place 4/5 due to the price. This place is a bit expensive yet tasty. Everyone working speaks English so if your Espanol is malo you'll still be ok.Enjoy!"
792,14-04-2018 ,5.0,Tapas were best in Barcelona good service. Easy to find just off the Main Street. Very busy will probably have to wait to get in but we’ll worth the wait.service very good
793,14-04-2018 ,5.0,We arrived at 10.30 pm and we still needed to wait an hour they said. Fortunately this was only 30 minutes but it was well worth it. The service is absolutely great and the food is delicious. We ordered a bottle of whine and a mix of several dishes. Definitely worth going here.
794,12-04-2018 ,4.0,Restaurant was recommended. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Very busy but did not have to wait too long. Noticed line up when leaving. Food arrived very quickly. Service was rushed and we felt we were supposed to eat and leave. No lingering over last of wine or to have a coffee.
795,10-04-2018 ,3.0,"Recommended by my hotel as a well respected establishment we arrived with enthusiasm at lunch time. Its a large restaurant, extremely busy, and we waited patiently for 10 mins for our table. Menu was in English and Spanish which was helpful. Staff confidently buzzing around. I found it quite noisy so not a place to relax. First sign was when our neighbours meal was sent back. We ordered a selection of tapas. We needed to send the omelete back twice as it was way under cooked, left and uneasy feeling as we were trying new foods. It was overall an average experience, would not be tempted to return, I think there are lots more to try in the city."
796,10-04-2018 ,3.0,Last time I was at Cervecería Catalana I enjoyed it very much. This time I was surprised by the comnercialism of the place and the lake of personal touch.Food was average with one dish that was inedible and another dish that looked like it was taken out from a vanding machine. Service was quick and impersonal. I felt like in a McDonalds.
797,9-04-2018 ,5.0,"I was given the recommendation to go here by the General Manager of Tanta, a Peruvian restaurant in Chicago. It was also recommended as a do not miss by the concierge of our hotel. We waited for about 45 minutes. The place was jammed for lunch & we were a party of 6. We had amazing tapas: lobster paella, octopus, eggplant,squid, cod, and some amazing desserts. I had a delicious chocolate dessert done 3 ways- a chocolate base, chocolate mousse, enrobed in dark chocolate with gold flakes. Delicious!!!"
798,9-04-2018 ,4.0,"Crowded place but the beer is cold and the food is good. Afordable prices, service a little too slow but understandable. I will come again sometime. Thanks!"
799,6-04-2018 ,1.0,"Have not experienced colder service anywhere. The food is ok but nothing special. Food is thrown at you with no eye contact and no engagement whatsoever. It is like eating in the middle of a construction site with staff running around at 100 miles an hour. The only comment from the waiter was 'service is not included' and it certainly wasn't. Always tip, not here. Awful place, with no warmth or humanity. Of all the places to go in Barca would strongly recommend anywhere else. I very much doubt the reviews on this page."
800,4-04-2018 ,5.0,"We were recommended by our hotel concierge to go here, but off peak hours since the wait can be a bit long. Now there’s a reason for this since this place is popular with locals, families, and visitors from abroad. The waitstaff were patient and friendly, but efficient. They had made suggestions for both drinks and food. We had a bottle of red and local beer with our tapas. Truly too many choices and all very good. If you’re into foie gras, the beef tenderloin with foie gras shouldn’t be missed. The other tapas, included some unusual dishes were will worth trying. Tip: good here off-hours. Before 1-4, and before 9pm. Even then, there may still be a wait. Highly recommended. "
801,4-04-2018 ,3.0,"Been there for dinner, picking the place given the so many 5 star reviews. While the experience was quite nice, the place did not stand out. On the plus side, the place is quite lively and well priced.On less nice side, while there are a number of tables outside, they are quite in the middle of a noisy busy traffic- if you want to dine outside, you can definitely find better choices.The tapas has been the main reason to try the place. While they were nice, nothing particular impressed in a way that would make us choose this place over other. In truth, we haven’t tried the famous mini burgers, which maybe could’ve made the difference."
802,3-04-2018 ,5.0,"The best tapas place in barcelona, once we found this place we pretty much spent all of our meals here. The aubergine crisps were just out of this world. Definitely the best! Price is slightly high though. Make sure to book, because it is really difficult to find a place!"
803,3-04-2018 ,5.0,"The food is delicious and as fresh as it can be! We sat at the bar, had several types of tapas, the razor clams are outstanding! The service excellent, we were there a day when the Barcelona soccer team played, so after the game that place was completely packed!!You can not go wrong here, highly recommended!"
804,3-04-2018 ,5.0, this place serves classical tapas and a few modern interpretations of them. Everything we tried was great. The pictures tel the story....
805,2-04-2018 ,4.0,"Our hotel concierge recommended Cerveceria Catalana and we were not disappointed. Fortunately we are accustomed to an earlier dinner hour than the locals so we were seated immediately. (By the time we were finished, people were waiting for tables.) Although we spoke neither Spanish nor Catalan and the server spoke very little English the service was excellent."
806,1-04-2018 ,3.0,Went with pretty high expectations since the reviews online are pretty much glowing. However we can’t really see the fuss. Food was average and the service was pretty meh. Their prawn skewers and egg special were pretty good though! Churros were below average because we could taste the oil (which was pretty old from what we remembered) 
807,1-04-2018 ,5.0,"After visiting Barcelona every February for many years, I still think that La Cerveceria Catalana offers the best food in Barcelona. It is located in the upscale L'Eixample, close to Gaudí’s Casa Batlló and Casa Milà. The atmosphere is lively. The service is friendly. It can get crowded and a long wait might be necessary.  Last time, we had paella, rice with cod, tuna caneloni with white sauce, cod with white beans, mushroom with egg, grilled squid, Andalusia squid (fried), grilled clams, potato fries with eggs, montadito with beef and fois and a sandwich with tuna, anchovies, roasted pepper and olives, chocolate with churros, St Helena bread pudding and caramelized apple.The cod dishes were specially good, the Andalusia squid was great, the potato fries mixed with eggs and the tuna sandwich were fantastic surprises.The St Helena bread pudding, which is actually a torrija, the Spanish version of French Toast, filled with cream and covered with crispy melted sugar, is the best torrija I ever had.The red house wine is excellent."
808,1-04-2018 ,2.0,"I guess we went there with very high expectations, based on our experience at Vinitus. The staff was quite rude, the food was nothing special. We will not go back."
809,31-03-2018 ,4.0,"Excellent Service, fair selection of tapas - seafood, salads, meat and traditional dishes (no paella, but there is the 4cheese pizza). Everything was quite good! Nice and charming place."
810,29-03-2018 ,4.0,"The food was very good, but it’s obvious they don’t need to go the extra mile in service to get customers."
811,29-03-2018 ,4.0,"The place is huge so this is not your cozy neighbourhood tapas place. However, service was good and fast and tapas was delicious. Would go again."
812,28-03-2018 ,5.0,"Just remember to go early! As a group of 6 people, we are lucky to get the last table without queuing. Lots of people waiting for table when we finished. Food was great and well presented. Totally worth to come and order lots to share with a bunch of love ones."
813,27-03-2018 ,5.0,If you are in the mood for the best tapas in town you should go to la cerveceria catalana. They have all kinds of options and offer a great variety of tipical spanish tapas. Order the patatas bravas and the cambebert cheese! You can never go wrong here
814,27-03-2018 ,5.0,"Whenever in Barcelona we eat hear at least once either breakfast, lunch or dinner.Don’t be put off for the long wait around 40-60 minutes for a table specially a dinner, register for a sitting and comeback 5-10 mins before the nominated time.If you chose the bar (good for 1-3 people) just wait behind a nominated spot with a drink on you hand and you will be sitting in 15-20 mins.The food is great and very affordable service very polished and the atmosphere absolutely crazy locals and tourist.Recommended "
815,26-03-2018 ,4.0,"This place earns it's reputation. Very fresh, highly varied tapas that are all very good. The mini hamburger was great, could eat half a dozen more. Sauteed mushrooms and asparagus were buttery and tasty. The huevos cabreaos (French fries covered in a spicy sauce and two perfectly poached eggs) was delicious. Good wine and beer selection, an English menu, and helpful staff who can all assist you in navigating your way to tasty tapas. That said, the place is always busy, and even when we went early to avoid the large crowd, the staff is primed for the bustling night and everyone is rushing and short-tempered. Not a knock on that staff, just the reality of the place, and it's not for the timid."
816,26-03-2018 ,5.0,"Each tapas cafe has its own selection of specialties. This cafe is no different. I had the garlic shrimps, coca bread, asparagus and mushrooms, and jamon. All were cooked to perfection. Great food but beware the queue if you intend to visit past 7."
817,25-03-2018 ,5.0,"Out best night in barcelona, most tasty tapas, or everything you will order from here, even deserts. Masterpiece in your plate for few money in real here. Make sure you reserve a table, cause here a long queue everytime. Must try. "
818,24-03-2018 ,5.0,"Went to Catalana twice during our recent trip to Barca. Tapas, seafood, puddings, draft beer and local vino all superb. Always busy and buzzing. Good service. Highly recommended."
819,23-03-2018 ,5.0,Everything we ordered was delicious. I especially like the Cabreaos potatoes with the soft fried egg on top. My vegan daughter had several delicious dishes to choose from and left satisfied as well. The service was great too.
820,23-03-2018 ,5.0,"This is a busy place, expect to wait , not sure if they take reservations but we were told 45 mins so I said we will go for a beer next door and come back and got our table straight away. Perfect. Better than standing aroundGreat atmosphereStaff are great, we had a little hiccup at first, but it was perfect by the time we left, day menu is in English, waiter too busy to explain. Go to bar counter and look but the counter is full of people . I don’t want to stick my nose in between people eating at the bar. Croquettes are all awesomeU need to order heuvos cabreaos. Best dish I’ve had in SpainEverything we had was delicious Desserts are real tapas size and made in the restaurant. U can eat 2/3 of these easy and I would again. Tip Bread pudding  Our bill was 55 , 2 persons . Little vino and plenty to eat . When U live elsewhere like I do, this was like free . Enjoy "
821,22-03-2018 ,5.0,"Amazing food, great friendly staff (for tending to the crazy cues all throughout the day), they are very efficient with the no reservation system. I don’t think we ordered one dish that we liked less than any other! They also have such a wide variety of options and so many that I went back with another friend from out of town the very next day and tried a whole new menu! Would highly recommend: charred calçots, mixed mushroom, pulpo, huevos cabreos, assorted tapas... they were all great! And would recommend going with a group of 2-4 people (share more and try more!) "
822,22-03-2018 ,4.0,"Spent my birthday in Barcelona and this restaurant was recommended by a local man who I met the night before at 'Vivant' - highly recommended! Didn't pre-book but after waiting about 5 mins, we were squeezed in. If you're in a group, book in advance. If you're not, take your chances but be prepared to wait. People were queuing down the block when we left. It was bonkers busy, lots of people sat at the counter, big groups squeezed in throughout the restaurant but the atmosphere was great, everyone looked happy and the food coming out of the kitchen looked fab. The staff are great, dead helpful when choosing what to eat. Take the recommendations, you won't be disappointed and don't order too much, too soon. You'll fill up quicker than you think. The food was super, especially the Beef loin and the potatoes with sauce and fried eggs! Chocolate dessert and the mini ice creams were delicious. Highly recommended! "
823,20-03-2018 ,5.0,"One of my Spanish friend from Barcelona suggested this restaurant and he was right. The food was delicious, the restaurant was clean and the service was good. We ate some tapas for lunch and the cheapest vine was also good!"
824,20-03-2018 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is situated on Carrer de Mallorca and is close to Passeig de Gracia metro station.It is a busy cafe and we were fortunate to secure an outside table.We had a large selection of tapas dishes, mostly seafood based, including razor clams, prawns and octopus. Numerous beers were consumed and we finished off with several carajillos.We spent around two hours at the restaurant and the bill came to around €30 per head."
825,19-03-2018 ,5.0,"Upon arriving in Barcelona, we asked our hotel staff any places he would recommend for us to eat some tapas and wine, he mentioned this place which is just a good 10 minute walk from our hotel. Saw some singing waiters, friendly diners and the food was really really REALLY good. Beautiful interiors too! We finished everything we ordered up to the last crumb of bread. "
826,18-03-2018 ,5.0,"Came for lunch and had no problem getting a seat for two at the bar right away Got the razor clams, foie gras with beef, grilled shrimp, shisito peppers, and some others. Whoever does the grilling here deserves to be paid very well because it’s the best grilled seafood I’ve ever had. If you are touristing in Barcelona, this is 5 minutes walk from Casa Batllo do you can go right after visiting another Gaudi creation. In fact the restaurant is worth going out of your way for even if it is not close to anything else. "
827,16-03-2018 ,5.0,"Visited 3 consecutive nights.We usually have to wait around 30 minutes drinking some cava.Once you have a table , they take your drinking orders and when you are ready they take your tapas orders.The service is very quick and professional. They know perfectly all parts of the menu including the various tapas of the day.Recommended: the sangria half liter ( for two ),the prawn skewers, the tenderloin sandwich,asparagus salad.The price is very moderate"
828,14-03-2018 ,5.0,Super busy restaurant where they take your name and tell you what time to come back. Both times we went they kept to their promise and the food was brilliant. Better than Ciudad Condal which is nearby and also has a strong reputation. I highly recommend here for upmarket tapas. Cantabria Anchovies a big highlight. 
829,13-03-2018 ,5.0,"I was cautiously excited before having the meals, especially after reading some of the reviews about the service. We waited for about 15 mins (not bad even it was quiet busy) for the table outside. Unfortunately they don't accept reservations. The staffs were patiently explained to us on the foods, and gave recommendations... so I debunk the reviews on the services cause it was just Great! So we had: Huevos cabreados (recommended!), Mini burger(it was ok but not my favourite), Clam (love it but small portion), Pork Paella (oh yum!), fried squid and asparagus with mushrooms.. with 2 sparkling waters n coffee, it costed about €55.. another great foods with good price! So.. it's a highly recommended place.. Just need to be patient on Q, even next to us were this couple just got lucky to sit there without Q..some people!! :))"
830,11-03-2018 ,5.0,"We ended up here late night, after a beautiful jazz show on the roof of La Pedrera. We sat at the bar and wound up talking to a mother-daughter duo visiting from Puerto Rico. We saw someone across the bar order a dish and we exclaimed: ""What is that!"" Our new friends said that's Huevos Cabreados and you must try it. We did and it was amazing. It's our new favorite dish. I've tried duplicating the recipe many mornings, but still haven't been able to capture the delicious flavors we tasted that night in Barcelona. If you are in Barcelona, go to this restaurant and order Huevos Cabreados!!!"
831,11-03-2018 ,3.0,"We went here during prime time. In general it is fine to have different waiters responsible for you. In this case it felt really not-personal and anonymous. The second we sat down we ordered drinks, had no time to look at the menu to decide on food yet. Right away a second waiter came and asked us what food we’d like. There seemed to be no communication between the waiters whatsoever. When we ordered our food and were about to order one last item from the menu, the waiter signalised with a hand gesture that he thinks it is enough. This seemed very inappropiate and was sad as it was our favourite one while staying in Barcelona, the patata brava :( also we felt a bit stressed all over and we were happy and relieved the moment we were outside again.Would not recommend, food was good though."
832,10-03-2018 ,4.0,"We had a great time at Cervecería catalana , great selection , long wait we love the jabugo ham , octopus , montadito de camarones . We will be back"
833,10-03-2018 ,4.0,"Even though my girlfriend and i had to wait for around 30mins for our table(we arrived at around 7pm on a weekday), staff wasted no time serving us and getting our orders prepped. "
834,9-03-2018 ,5.0,Huevos cabreados and Torrija de Santa Teresa. That is all you need to know ! You will have to wait 30 mins to be seated
835,8-03-2018 ,3.0,Took a family member for their first meal in Barcelona. Food was okay. The service was almost too fast and we felt rushed. The restaurant is good but didn’t live up to the hype.
836,8-03-2018 ,5.0,This restaurant was recommended to us by friends and it didn’t disappoint. We arrived at about 8pm put our names on the waiting list and then went for a drink round the corner. Arrive back as requested a little earlier than the expected time and don’t be put off with the wait. We were shown to our table slightly earlier than estimated. It is certainly worth the wait. The food is fresh and very tasty. One of our party is vegetarian and was still well catered for (unusual in Spain). The service is fast but we never felt hurried and you are not encouraged to leave quickly.The staff were helpful and friendly even though they were extremely busy.A great restaurant with lots of atmosphere.
837,7-03-2018 ,4.0,"We went to eat early by Spanish standards, therefore avoided waiting for a table. The menu is quite extensive so took the waiters recommendation. Everything was delicious."
838,5-03-2018 ,5.0,"some of the best tapas we ate in barcelona. super delicious items, and LOTS of items.we could not stop ordering. and ate a lot. the drinks are great too.the only issue is a wait time of over 1 hour, but worth the wait."
839,5-03-2018 ,4.0,"Recomended coming in the afternoon , after a walk in the city , if u feel hungry , this is the place , posible to take some ´´tapas´´ and some drink , continue looking the condal city...."
840,5-03-2018 ,3.0,"Ordered a grill fried squid tapas and it waa like rubber, couldn't't eat it. Told the waitress but she didn't mind. We were here for breakfast and the other things we ate were nice, but not enough to make it worth it really. "
841,4-03-2018 ,3.0,"First time I went to this restaurant was in 2011. It was late for lunch time, but food was really good and with a taste of traditional, the place is big yet it was not very crowded. Specially the classic eggs with potatoes, best one I've ever had. Then I repeated two more times. Food had change for the worse. I couldn't find the same flavours as in the first time, and it was much less average. The third time I went I said it was the last time. The ratio quality-price-confort is just not worth it. The dishes were really average, too pricy for what you get, and the people really busy around to enjoy nothing. I will never give it another chance. It may look like a really special place, yet it is not."
842,4-03-2018 ,5.0,"Excellent food , Probably the most well known tapas restaurant in Barcelona. Near Gaudi apartment. But Very busy at all times. Plan to wait min 30-40 min. Been many times . food is amazing well prepared .Staff is very helpful on what to order. But the place is very busy, be patient . About 30 euros a person without alcohol ..You need to try it at least once. This and Taller de Tapas are excellent "
843,3-03-2018 ,5.0,"We were there twice for lunch. The selection of tapas are great. We seat at the bar, which is the best option if you are going for tapas. The staff was very friendly and the food excellent."
844,3-03-2018 ,5.0,One of my favourite places to bring visitors to Barcelona. Excellent mix of traditional Spanish tapas in a good atmosphere. Service is superb! Very difficult to get a table between 8-10pm so be prepared to wait.
845,3-03-2018 ,5.0,five of us dined here on our trip to barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed the atmospher and tapas selection is second to none we were advise by a friend who stays in barcelona and were not dissapointed superb . jonter50
846,3-03-2018 ,3.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a tapas place in central Barcelona. We went there sunday at lunch time, and that was not a good idea. The place was crowded and people were in line both inside the restaurant and outside. It could be a weekend thing, but nonetheless anoying.The food was decent and also the service. But everything happened in such a rush that the pleasure with tapas was gone. We had the feeling of an assembly lane. Once inside the drinks came - bum. Then the food - bum. No feeling that the costumer was special.The food was decent - not special. Again the feeling of an assembly line came in mind.The place is famous cause it won prices for the best food in Barcelona some time ago, but it seems that the special feeling is gone.We tried it. It was decent. So was the prices. Indeed in the lower end of Barcelona. But we will not come back. The place is too big and looses it personality."
847,27-02-2018 ,5.0,"We went here on a Saturday evening with 5 persons without reservation. We could put our name on the list and come back 40 minutes later. We shared different kinds of tapas and sangria. The waiter was so friendly to help us choose, especially because one of us has a gluten and lactose intolerance. Everything tasted delicious and came fast enough. Best we ate: Fried camembert!"
848,26-02-2018 ,5.0,"Come here 3rd time, almost eat here every year when I come to MWC in Barcelona. This year I was lucky to have table only after waiting for 2 minutes."
849,26-02-2018 ,3.0,"We were there at 7pm, it was already busy, we didn’t wait for too long before getting a table.The menu is available in both Spanish and English making the selection of the tapas easier, I would recommend to add some photos to make it even more easier to understand what are we ordering.The waiting time was a breeze, we were served almost immediately. The selection is great, the portions are okay, and all the products we tried were fresh.We were aware that it is a “touristic” place, so we didn’t expect too much neither, but weren’t disappointed by quality. It’s just we had better tapas elsewhere.Overall I would recommend if you want to taste a wide variety of tapas but if you wang a better taste, you can find better options in town."
850,25-02-2018 ,4.0,"Since it's really popular place, it's really crowded most of the time. But we where really lucky to get the table outside, we had to wait only around 15-20 minutes while drinking sangria :) Food and service was really nice and very fast! Part of the menu was in Spanish therefore I couldn't understand it, which is weird if a lot of tourists visits this place daily :) but anyway I would recommend it! :)"
851,22-02-2018 ,5.0,"Specifically went to this restaurant on our recent visit to Barcelona. 30 to 45 minutes wait but well worth it, food choice and quality superb, staff could not be nicer. Really try not to miss this when in City."
852,21-02-2018 ,4.0,This place was crowded even at 3 pm. The beef with foie tapa was very good. Assorted tapas came with shrimps and they are so good. 
853,21-02-2018 ,5.0,"We frequented this place several times during our stay. It gets VERY crowded, but for good reason - the food is amazing! We visited Barcelona with our 10 month old baby. Every time we visited this restaurant, they did not make us wait the average 1 hour wait time for this restaurant. Instead they seated us almost immediately since we had a baby with us!! I thought this was so considerate of them!!! We never had to wait longer than 10 minutes. Service is fast, and friendly. I would recommend getting the Jamon with Tomato bread. And the Cabreas here are AMAZING too!"
854,19-02-2018 ,5.0,"Serve tasty tapas and full range of liquor . Wide range of variety for tapas. Price is still quite reasonable . Store is Very crowded late into the night. To avoid the queue, 5-7pm Will be a good time to enjoy your meal there. "
855,19-02-2018 ,5.0,"Heard a lot about this place so had to give it a try!! We arrived at 18:30 and got a seat straight away! Food an service were really good, lots of well prepared dishes especially the beef tenderloin, mini hamburgers,razor clams :) Would definitely go back! The kids loved it"
856,18-02-2018 ,5.0,I prefer this tapas place to many others. It's still a mix of tourists and normal people. Service is far and friendly the tapas are Catalan and great. It's worth a visit you want to be early if not there won't be any tables left.
857,18-02-2018 ,5.0,"Superb shellfish, best ever.Great atmosphere.Great beer.Very helpfull waiters.Great buzz.Real Lisbon both locals and tourists."
858,17-02-2018 ,4.0,"This place is a very nice place where you can have all kind of tapas, I tried to get there in a night the line was beyond you imagination, however in the morning it was OK and you can get all kind of sandwiches, tapas, coffe etc..., it was cozy and nice and everything was very just perfect."
859,17-02-2018 ,5.0,This was my second visit and it did not disappoint! We did not have to wait long for the table and the food was fantastic. Would recommend the beef fillet on bread and peppers!!
860,17-02-2018 ,5.0,"Wow !! This place is a hit - went for dinner per a Spanish friend’s recommendation and we surely weren’t disappointed - tapas were 2 die 4 and sangria was very tasty - the waitress , such a sweet filipina lady, was so funny and attentive - please don’t be discourage for the waiting time as this place doesn’t take reservations. We were told that it’d take around 45’ waiting but in fact after 15’ we were seated and having a bless - a must go while in Barcelona ! "
861,16-02-2018 ,4.0,"We arrived Barcelona quite early in the afternoon, we decided to have some light food before dinner, we found the restaurant got lots of people having tapas, and the valuation is high in TripAdvisor, so we decided to try. We ordered roasted shrimp, roasted pork Sandwich with paper, beef on bread, fried baby squid, and carrot bread, fried paper, all tested good, only the goat cheese on vegetables too much goat flavor which is not good for me. Good choice anyway and I will recommend people to visit."
862,16-02-2018 ,5.0,This is a must visit in Barcelona. You will wait for a table but it is so worth the wait. Food is amazingly fresh and flavoursome and so cheap! Fave tapas ever. 
863,16-02-2018 ,5.0,"We got to this restaurant around 1 pm, as a precursor to a visit to Casa Mila, around the corner. We were seated immediately. We ordered razor clams, calcots, aubergine tortilla, pan catalan a veg dish and churros and chocolate for dessert. The food was amazing. Both of us are dedicated foodies and it was all interesting, well prepared and beautifully presented. The churros were the best I have ever had, having lived in Spain and travelled all over the country. The small pot of chocolate was dense, rich and dar, just enough at the end of a sumptious lunch. Our total bill, along with two glasses of lovely and very nice Rioja wine, 36.00 euros. We were extremely pleased with the quality of the food, the excellent staff and the price. We tried to go back but the line was over an hour long. I felt very lucky to have gotten a table at any time."
864,16-02-2018 ,5.0,"If you are in Barcelona or just visiting, this place is a must. They serve the best tapas in town and have a super friendly staff. The place is always full, so pass by put your name on the list, enjoy a little stroll in town and head back for the amazing food and experience "
865,15-02-2018 ,5.0,We had a 20 minute wait at a Tuesday lunchtime. There is a reason for this ! A very memorable place with fantastic food
866,15-02-2018 ,5.0,"We were very impressed with the great and fast service, but most of all, the absolutely delicious meal. We tried several tapas, including “bogavante’ (bigger than a shrimp, smaller than a lobster) rice which was heavenly. Don’t miss this restaurant when visiting Barcelona. Very busy, maybe will have to wait a long time to be seated, but worth it. Try to go early, by oneish, since locals eat later."
867,15-02-2018 ,5.0,I was looking for dinner at that time suddenly i found this restaurant. And im happy that i was there. The food was good. And the service also great. Its better you booked first
868,14-02-2018 ,5.0,"The food was amazing, this is the way to eat Spanish food, sampling tid bits of different food, tapas is the way to eat Spanish, and this place is the best in the city, also the pricing of fair and well worth the money. Not to be missed "
869,14-02-2018 ,3.0,"Food is very good but disappointed with how rushed the staff were. Plates were taken away as soon as the last piece was eaten and waiters eye rolled when asked for tap water and where the toilet was. Overall, we felt very unwelcome. Shoutout to the Japanese speaking Philippine who was the only decent member of staff. "
870,13-02-2018 ,5.0,"Must try if you are in Barcelona!!We knew there was going to be lots of people so we went at around 10:15, we are lucky enough to get a table without waiting as the restaurant was almost full. The food was served quickly and efficiently. We ordered the baguette, mini hamburgers and tapas (patatas bravas, pesto with mushrooms and asparagus, tortilla, croquettes). I would recommend all the tapas~ The food was amazing and the price was affordable. "
871,11-02-2018 ,5.0,"We arrived around 8pm and I was told it would be 45 minutes. We decided to wait and we are glad that we did. Service was very fast, food was outstanding and the prices very reasonable. We had the seafood salad , chicken salad, fried calamari and croquettes all were fantastic. With sangria the total bill was 38.00.....WOW. When you see a line don’t be afraid because we only had to wait 20 minutes and not the 45. If you a great meal at a great price then this is your place."
872,10-02-2018 ,5.0,"Worth waiting! Delicious and quick and delicious, deliciously:) fresh and perfectly done. Great service:) It is a MUST point in Barcelona :) 4 days in Barca and 4 dinners here :) "
873,10-02-2018 ,5.0,"Simply stunning. Service, food and atmosphere. No reservations so waitingvtimes to get seated. But oh so worth it."
874,7-02-2018 ,4.0,"Too busy but nice food at good price, good portions, good variety, good wine and lots tapas options. "
875,4-02-2018 ,4.0,Food was amazing. Great flavours and the beef tenderloin was superb. Staff on the other hand were rude and unhelpful especially with the specials menu being in Spanish with no English translation. Only time they helped was at the end as clearly after a tip. Would recommend but take google for translating the specials board 
876,4-02-2018 ,4.0,"A very solid restaurant all around. Nearly everything is done well and makes an accessible representation and entrance point to the food of the region. The atmosphere is lively and fun. The only knocks I have for it are that while everything is very good, what is missing is that one signature thing that sticks out as exceptional. But this is an easy restaurant to return to time and again."
877,4-02-2018 ,5.0,"Breakfast, lunch ir dinner...for a Lucky moments you can sit because its so popular but extremely genuïnes tapas "
878,3-02-2018 ,5.0,Tried this Tapas bar after the disaster of Tapas 24 and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. We had four Tapas and they were all around €4. We had a drink each and the bill was €20. Service was quick but not unfriendly and the atmosphere was great. Food was varied and delicious. I would definitely go back.
879,2-02-2018 ,4.0,"As the previous reviews said, the food there is delicious, my husband and I got a bottle of wine and tapas (4) and it was very good and a very good price. I only think it should have more variety of tapas. But I recommend it. "
880,2-02-2018 ,5.0,"Back in this restaurant every time I return to Barcelona and ,as always, we had a superb lunch. It worths the time waiting for a free table,you will never regret. Absolutely fantastic!!"
881,2-02-2018 ,5.0,"Another awesome tapas bar in Barcelona!Probably just as good as Ciutat. We were quite delighted to stumble into this place. The restaurant is beautiful and the food is great! Be ready to wait over an hour on peak hours. We had almost the same favorites here like Ciutat, the beef tenderloin with Foie gras. The gambas were also just as good. The service was excellent and the hostess was so nice and accommodating to us. We were in this side of town so it was nice to find another tapas bar that is just as good as our favorite Tapas bar!"
882,1-02-2018 ,5.0,Can get busy. Nice area. Outdoor/indoor options. Good prices. Yummy tapas. One of the best tapas/drinks spots I came across.
883,29-01-2018 ,4.0,"Good atmosphere, good service, and most importantly good food! Excellent place for breakfast/brunch as they open earlier than other shop."
884,28-01-2018 ,4.0,Tapas are amazingly tasteful! I suggest booking before coming since the place is always packed mostly at night. Got a table but needed to wait for at least an hour. Like I said tapas here are delicious but on the pricey side. Not ideal for kids since food choices are more on tapas only. It worth the experience. Service is very efficient and friendly. 
885,27-01-2018 ,5.0,"We went here on our first night in Barcelona. We chose it based on TripAdvisor reviews and proximity to our hotel. Every dish was flavorful and fresh, there were plenty of options for vegetarians, the sangria was delicious and the staff was helpful. After trying several other restaurants during our trip we went back on our last night because we were not able to top the experience anywhere else."
886,26-01-2018 ,5.0,The wife and I sat on the bar and ate wonderful tapas with great wine. The food was great and especially the salmon tapas.Salads and food afe fresh and the vibe is great 
887,26-01-2018 ,5.0,"although the restaurant is a real ""factory"" with lots of servers and extremely fast turnaround times, the quality of the food is amazingly good. Waiting times to be seated typically between 20 and 60 minutes, but you can have a beer while waiting. This restaurant must be pointed out in some japanese travel guide, as many of the guests are Japanese. Deserts are also delicious."
888,25-01-2018 ,1.0,"Our first disappointing experience in Barcelona. We went there at 4:30pm, there were lots of empty tables and lots of waiters. All of the staff that we had contact with were unpleasant. They served us cold wet toast, which was supposed to be Pan c/Tomate. Except for the sliced ham, the tapas were unsavory. We left quite a bit on our plates, but no one asked why."
889,23-01-2018 ,5.0,Very good quality of tapas and very cheap if you compares with others restaurants in the same area! If you like tapas you must try this restaurant....
890,23-01-2018 ,5.0,"Went for lunch, great experience, all kind of tapas and great ambiance.Customer Service was great, food was excellent."
891,22-01-2018 ,4.0,"Nice place with delicious tapas ! Fried scampies, pepers are the top notch ! Btw desert menu is not same level with tapas in my point but you can try 3 types of chocolate ;)"
892,22-01-2018 ,5.0,We ended up ordering seven different tapas and three deserts. All were fantastic and tasted great. Service was friendly and fast and the overall experience recommendable.
893,21-01-2018 ,5.0,"Amazing and friendly staff;Cozi restaurant;Excelent food;Good price!!Busy place, arrive early, but they have lots of tables...Commendable..."
894,20-01-2018 ,5.0,"We arrived about 5.45pm, so early by Barcelona standards. The restaurant was very busy but we had to wait less than 5 minutes. The waiters were very helpful, explaining what some dishes were and making recommendations. Despite being so busy the food came out quickly. We ordered several dishes and they came out when they were ready, not all at once, which was good! There was a vast selection of fish dishes but plenty of others too. Among lots of other things we had huevos cabreaos, which came with a fried egg on top and the waiter blended in to the dish at the table - it was the best! I would also recommend the Iberico ham and the bread pudding. The service was very quick, and the waiters were so helpful and attentive throughout our visit. I would definitely recommend!"
895,19-01-2018 ,4.0,"Good lively place with a very lively atmosphere. The food is quite good, with a very wide variety of fish and meat tapas."
896,18-01-2018 ,4.0,"had the calcots with really good romanesco sauce... the grilled cuttlefish was so good...had some vegetables with mayonaise on bread. the bread was nice and crispy...i have had soggy bread in other places... sign that bread is was probably sitting on the counter to long.great friendly staff... we went early ( barcelona standards), around 6 pm. always come here at least once, when i am in barcelona."
897,17-01-2018 ,4.0,"This place is definitely the victim of its own success. The first night we came by here the line was out the door, and the wait was almost an hour. The second time we arrived early and had no issue getting in, but found a packed house. The tables are not overly cramped together, but with that many people you can expect a bit longer wait times for service.The food was really good, and during our visit we tried a variety of Tapas. Some I would recommend are the grilled prawns, papas bravas, padron peppers, and the cuttlefish. The Iberico ham was ok as well, though not as succulent as some other places.The prices were fair for the style of food, and I found the wait staff to be helpful when available. It would be best to come early if you wish to have a quieter dining experience."
898,16-01-2018 ,5.0,A friend from Barcelona introduced me to this tapas place a few years ago and it really became my favorite restaurant in Barcelona. The offer of tapas is great for a decent price. My favorite tapas is definitely the crujiente de queso.
899,16-01-2018 ,4.0,"I visited Cerveceria Catalana for my first meal in Barcelona which happened to be lunch. Our server was very helped in ordered items from their tapas menu. I sat outside, which was nice. Next time I will order from the bar inside the restaurant. All of the tapas were fresh and filling for a nice, quick lunch."
900,14-01-2018 ,5.0,"I cannot wait to come back to Barcelona even if it’s just to come here for tapas!!!!! We had read reviews and knows it gets busy and you cannot book, when we got there there were about 10-12 people in front of us so we decided to wait, however we waited no longer than 10 mins which was great. I just don’t know where to start there was loads of things on the menu we could have ordered and we hadn’t eaten all day I will include pictures you might think it’s loads but some things were small. So the first tapas we received was the green peppers (my favourite dish I could have just had that and would still be as happy) as well as thin fries with egg and ham plus a sauce (I do not normally like eggs but that was so yummy) best first two dishes to come out and there was plenty of both so well worth the money. We also ordered: one mini burger, mushrooms and asperges, pork and pepper floaters, beef tenderloin, baked Camembert stick with raspberry jam, potatoes bravas then for desert churros, creme brûlée and a triple chocolate block. Like I said a lot of food but again worth it and hungry souls we also had a jug of sangria which we had about 3 glasses each from it. Well what was good that we had: fries with egg, green peppers, beef tenderloin, mini burger, churros and creme brûlée well that’s what I enjoyed my husband definitely liked the chocolate log desert plus others I also enjoyed and mentioned. However what I haven’t listed I enjoyed was still good and very tasty but not to compare to what the others tasted like with flavour. Everything came out hot and I liked that it all didn’t come all at once as we would have ran out of room on the table and were very good at cleaning everything away when you say you were finished. I just cannot fault anything lovely place lovely atmosphere lovely people who work there. A+++++++++ AMAZING please visit try go early in the night so you don’t have to queue for long and if you do wait as it’s worth it!"
901,13-01-2018 ,5.0,My boyfriend and I are in Barcelona for three days now and we have gone to this place for dinner all three night. The food is delicious. Love the ambiance and just everything! The red and white sangrias are also very good. Save room for dessert and get the bread pudding. As far as Tapas: We tried A LOT of them and they were all really good. Some of my favorites wereRemena (SO GOOD) Mini hamburger Cabrearos Prawn skewer Asparagus and Mushrooms 
902,13-01-2018 ,5.0,"We found this on Google maps looking for something close to our apartment with decent ratings. We arrived at 8:15 thinking it was early enough to beat the crowds on a Wednesday night but the line was out the door and the wait was going to be about an hour. We decided the crowd was a good indicator and waited it out - turned out to be 75 minutes. It was worth the wait. The restaurant is larger than you think at first because it wraps all around the entry of the adjacent building, and it was packed. We had time to notice the dishes coming out of the kitchen so we knew to order the roasted artichokes which were posted on the Spanish daily specials menu but not on the English standard menu, so remember that if you go - the printed English version won't have the daily specials. In addition to the artichokes we had smoked salmon, jamon, chicken croquettes, and huevos cabreados, which translates to ""angry eggs"" - fried eggs on top of crispy thin french fries with bits of chorizo and a mild sauce. Break up the eggs and let the yolk mix with the sauce and chorizo bits into the fries and you're in heaven. With a bottle of rioja and the best grilled bread with tomato/olive oil spread that we had in BCN - it was a great meal! Go, expect crowds, watch the dishes coming out of the kitchen to know what to order, and enjoy!"
903,10-01-2018 ,2.0,Disappointed. The waiter at the bar couldn't speak much English and recommended me anything. I have not been eating tapas often so I am unfamiliar with the menu. 
904,10-01-2018 ,4.0,"The scaring crowd pushing in the afternoon at the entrance should not discourage you. The efficient lady will seat you in a surprisingly fast time.The waiters and waitresses will take care of you with surprising efficiency and speed.And tapas are just delicious, so does local beers."
905,9-01-2018 ,1.0,"Very average food, not worth the price in my opinion. Don't just go by the positive reviews, I wouldn't be surprised if some of them are fake. "
906,9-01-2018 ,5.0,"The tapas are great, the wait excruciating. The wait staff especially if you get the Philipinos, are pretty outstanding. There is a lot of buzz. Just order a lot of Sangria and everything from the menu (except the fried sardines), specially the Tapas of the day, some pleasant surprises there.Must keep space for desserts."
907,9-01-2018 ,5.0,Lovely food. Great service. Lovely wine. Not much more to say really. Staff were really friendly. Service was quick and efficient. Food was served quick and was lovely. This is not an expensive restaurant either. Good choice 
908,9-01-2018 ,4.0,This was recommended by a friend who lives in Barcelona and it sure didn't disappoint. It is a very popular place and we had to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table but it is worth it! They have great tapas and alcohol but it is a bit on the expensive side! A must visit in Barcelona
909,8-01-2018 ,5.0,Super efficient service. Friendly staff and wonderful food. The tapas are excellent. They are served quickly. The drinks are of good quality. Would recommend the sangria and the rioja. We enjoyed the mixed tapas and the Iberian ham. The restaurant is larger than it appears on the outside. Worth waiting for a table.
910,8-01-2018 ,5.0,"The first time I visited Cerveceria was 2 years ago, and went back 3 times because it was that good. Last week I dropped off my daughter to study in Barcelona and again visited what I think is some of the best tapas in Barcelona. This is a popular, happening place. Tapa's are very good, very good Spanish wine selection, service was attentive and helpful. Great selection of tapas. I will be back and highly recommend."
911,8-01-2018 ,5.0,"Nice food, good selection of tapas and drinks, friendly staff. In addition to standard menu, they got a long list of ""today's dish"" with available seafood and other stuff. Wait line was around 25 minutes for us."
912,7-01-2018 ,4.0,"Busy place with lots of locals eating, indicative of its popularity. The food was superb. We went three times in two days we enjoyed it so much. Save room for dessert."
913,5-01-2018 ,5.0,"Overall the tapas are of excellent quality. Everyday they have new options, open everyday practically. Sometimes crowded, but they have a lot of tables and you can sit fast. Fresh fish, clams, good vegetable options, great shrimp. Top class tapas, cheap options, high quality. Fantastic mar i montagna, boquerones a andaluza, pez frito con patron, jamos gla with a very special thick cut, worth to come back many times."
914,5-01-2018 ,5.0,Yummy tapas. I think everything is good. Ambiance is great! Very near our serviced apartment. Must try!
915,5-01-2018 ,5.0,"Nothing makes tou feel more in Barcelona then having a few tapas in the bar, this place is my favorite and the scene is always lively."
916,4-01-2018 ,4.0,This place reminds me of chic bistro in paris. Totally love it. So much varieties to choose from. Creative and modern tapas. Our tastebuds are totally delighted. Must try their version of the fried patatas tapas (thin fried potatoes with eggs in the middle). It was one of the best dishes we've had. The foei gras was huge! Will definitely come back again when we are in barcelona. One of the best tapas place we've eaten in 3 weeks in spain.
917,3-01-2018 ,5.0,"Heard about this place from a couple on our Andorra tour so looked it up. There was a 40 minute wait for a party of two when we arrived and it had grown to a 1.5 hour wait by the time we left. And with good reason: everything was incredible! We scored two seats at the bar so didn't have to wait the 40 minutes. I don't know how Claudia the hostess remains so charming all evening with the constant barrage of customers. Juan behind the bar took great care of us. One problem was we were sitting next to the delivery area so my friend was able to see each dish coming out and then he wanted it. Definitely order the tenderloin with foie on top - melts in your mouth. He had to send back for a 2nd bread pudding it was so delicious. And at the end of the evening, we were shocked (and pleased) to see that after so many glasses of wine and plates of food, it was still less than what we spend on a Saturday evening here in the states!!"
918,1-01-2018 ,5.0,"Cerveceria have good Cervezas (beer) and a great ambiance; very good tapas and light small menus, good wine and cold drinks; often busy so you have to wait a little bit."
919,31-12-2017 ,4.0,The tapas were very good and the service was good so no complaints just remember that its all small portions but that way you get to try different things. We were in Barcelona for 3 nights so this was one of our dinners and we found as long as you went before 8pm you shouldn't wait too long for a table but we are used to eating earlier so by 6 we were at the Restaurants and we were seated right away. 
920,31-12-2017 ,5.0,"Visited on New Years with the whole family. Very busy establishment but definitely a must if you like tapas related bites. Great and friendly staff, very knowledgeable ad helpful. A MUST go in Barcelona. It worth the time you have to spend waiting. "
921,31-12-2017 ,1.0,"Food was okay, nothing special. Felt more like a tourist trap. The huevos cabreaos looks tasty but ended up tasting like small fries with an egg and ketchup. The croquettes were good and dessert (bread pudding) was nice. I came here because I really wanted to try the razor clams. The waiter completely forgot about it. When the dessert came I realized that and just went with it because I didn't want to have to eat an appetizer after a dessert. The table next to us who came 20 min after us also ordered razor clams and they received it during our dessert. the waiter noticed we were staring at it and I think he realized that he had forgot. We kept asking for another water and I saw him put the water order into his tablet but it never came even after 15 min. We got the check and I was curious to see if he would have charged us for the razor clams and extra water and surely enough he did! It's interesting because I think he was trying to charge us for the razor clams even knowing it didn't come. Why would I think that? Well the order of everything on the check was exactly the order that I asked for things. Each appetizer and entree was listed in the order I asked and then were the two desserts, then was the second water I asked for THEN was the razor clams. So I felt like he was trying to top up the bill. Really lame. Bad service. When I was ready to pay my bill I handed my credit card along with the bill to this other waiter and told that waiter the bill was wrong. He went to talk to my waiter and they decided to take the water and razor clams off but my waiter didn't apologize or anything. Just ignored us when we left.I wrote this review on Yelp too and got a private message from the waiter that started with ""so not true"" As soon as I read that I just deleted it and didn't bother reading it because at the end of the day, this is these are the impressions I had from dining there and I don't need to defend my crappy experience."
922,29-12-2017 ,5.0,"This is the best Tapas place in Barcelona. Period.Prices are excellent, the food quality in unparalleled and, the ambience of the place is also great.That said, be prepared to wait. They don't accept reservations and the place is always full of people..."
923,29-12-2017 ,1.0,"The waiting line is very long, the waiter's treatment was shocking, they simply laid down the food and went. No one asked if the food was good for us. And for the food, some of the shrimps were not clean and we had to pull out their spinal cord with all the blood - it made us lose the urge of eating them. Most of the dishes are prepared in advance and this is felt, we ate toast with crab meat and probably for at least half an hour and the taste was bland. We just wanted to run away!"
924,28-12-2017 ,5.0,"Excellent place for tapas, one of the best we had in Barcelona, great atmosphere and big variety of food and tapas."
925,28-12-2017 ,4.0,"This place offers a wide range of reasonably priced tapas. We were a large crowd, 13 people and got there for lunch. We were seated within a few minutes on two large tables. This is nice as in our experience with most tapas, seating 13 people have been a challenge. We have ordered a fairly large selection of items and the overall experience was positive. Some of the tapas were great hits like the fries and eggs and some were a miss, mostly those with seafood (perhaps an acquired taste). We found that the portions were slightly bigger than other tapas so it was easier to share some of the plates and order less of them. Good Sangria and a consistent service. It did not wow us to say we would go again but for one time, it was definitely worth the visit."
926,28-12-2017 ,4.0,A decent place to eat. Food is good. The staff are very efficient given the volume of people go through this restaurant. It gets very busy. ...again no drink menu!
927,27-12-2017 ,5.0,We got there late around midnight and the place was still quite crowded which we didn't mind as it was our first spanish experience. We found out later it was a little bit pricey for tapas but the food was excellent. Not for a romantic date but a definite must visit for foreigners.
928,27-12-2017 ,5.0,"Because it's Spain, tapas can be found on every block. This place stands out. I've only sat at the bar but service is quick (but you don't feel rushed) so it seems seats for tables and the bar move quickly. The food is delish! :) I recommend the salmon brochette, cod skewer and prawn skewer. You'll likely get more than one of each. They are used to tourists so switch between Spanish and English quite fluently as the customer in front of them changes. Have had cafe au lait and sangria which were both good. I've been 2 days in a row if that helps. :)"
929,27-12-2017 ,4.0,"This place was on recommendation by our front desk....we ended up there 3 times!! That’s how delicious every tapas we had was! It is very popular with the after-work crowd and it’s mostly locals....and always crowded!The food is all freshly made and served just a few minutes after ordering. My favorite was the Patatas Carballo, shoe string fries with fried egg and a special sauce.....a must have!I highly recommend this tapas cervecería!!"
930,27-12-2017 ,4.0,"I really enjoyed this place! The tapas and sangria were so yummy, and the service was great. I would definitely return. Some in our group weren’t prepared for the size of the small plates, but I loved getting to sample so many different things. "
931,27-12-2017 ,4.0,"This is an elegant tapas restaurant. There's a bar counter in front, but also a large sit down section. It must attract a lot of tourists as the staff are quite multinational. Being December, it was not very busy when we went there for lunch. We got a table straightaway.The tapas are delicious. There's quite a bit of variety on the menu, and I'd like to come back in future to try more things. This place makes a good lunch stop if you're exploring the Passeig de Gracia."
932,26-12-2017 ,5.0,"The wait is long the but the experience, food, and good vibes from the staff are worth it. This is the place I love to take visitors to in BCN."
933,25-12-2017 ,4.0,We sat at the bar on a busy night. The service was quick and efficient. They specialize in their toast with toppings; we especially loved the salmon and the iberico jam. The mini cheeseburgers were also very good. 
934,25-12-2017 ,5.0,"Flavorful delights and rapid service make the wait to get a table worthwhile. Don’t miss it, you’ll enjoy the food. "
935,25-12-2017 ,5.0,Cerveseria CatalanaHighly recommended when in Barcelona. Everybody said we had to try this at least once. We decided to have breakfast there. Very nice atmosphere. We tried some sandwiches. Of course one of them had to be with the Jamon Jabugo and local cheese. A couple of sampler platters and Barcelona’s version of the Bruschetta. All delightful. Some good cappucino’s and we were ready for the day to start. 4 people and only 33.45 Euro.
936,24-12-2017 ,5.0,Very tasty! Not expensive. Serving is just enough! Staff veey attentive and theres variety of food from menu. 
937,24-12-2017 ,5.0,"I've eaten here on business trips before, and also very popular amongst other crew I work with.We expected to have to wait for a table, but I guess being December made it slightly easier, as we were seated straight away.We got over this shock by ordering a very nice bottle of Rioja and tapas shortly after.We had a mixture from pardon peppers to garlic prawns, via egg dishes and a few others.The food as always was excellent as was the service and value for money.Would recommend highly."
938,23-12-2017 ,4.0,"Some of the best tapas that we had in Barcelona. We arrived during the peak time around 21:00 on a Wednesday and had to wait around 15 minutes for a table. While the restaurant was packed, there was luckily a lot of turnover.The wait was well worth it and we enjoyed some excellent tapas. We particularly liked the fried green peppers, fried baby squid, assorted mushrooms, Spanish omelette and garlic prawns. We weren't big fans of the anchovies in vinegar and the bravas potatoes but enjoyed the Sangria. Service was extremely attentive and fast."
939,23-12-2017 ,4.0,"We ordered almost everything on the menu since we had a big group. The scallop and prawns on skewers there were simply amazing! We ordered the fried camembert but we were too full by the time it was served. The downside is that you have to wait more than 30 mins for a table during peak period but the service is pretty fast. So if you have the time, do try out this restaurant."
940,23-12-2017 ,5.0,"Was recommended this restaurant by friends. It is amazing, only went for tapas but everything we had was great. Lots of choices and great quality. Did have to wait to get seats at bar but well worth the wait "
941,21-12-2017 ,4.0,"Usually packed, we were lucky enough to get a table fast, however we were told that the maximum stay time was 2 hours. Food quality overall was very good, the service was super fast, friendly and very attentive. All the tapas we had were very good, wine selection was good and the atmosphere was great. Prices are a little high"
942,18-12-2017 ,4.0,"The food and the atmosphere was good. However, the space is a bit small and sometimes too crowded. Staff are friendly."
943,14-12-2017 ,4.0,My first tapas experience happened in here . Nice service guys helped me choosing tapas. Garlic shrimp was delicious. 
944,11-12-2017 ,5.0,"Really great choice of tasty tapas. Liked a lot the fish, but also the huevos cabreados were delicious. Super friendly service, good sangria and honest prices."
945,10-12-2017 ,4.0,"The place was crowded and we are waiting about 30min only have seat. We had our tapas with sangria, perfect match to kick off the 1st meal in Barcelona. Authentic cuisine."
946,8-12-2017 ,5.0,This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend as a place for traditional tapas and Catalan food. The atmosphere was great - trendy and vibrant yet not pretentious. The staff were very helpful and the food was excellent.
947,7-12-2017 ,5.0,"I really reccomend this place. Food is very good, but be prepared for long waiting for the table. Quicer is to get the plece next to the bar."
948,6-12-2017 ,4.0,Tapas were really good and we had Sangria with our meal... we wish they had Paella but they did not so that was a bit disappointment 
949,6-12-2017 ,4.0,"My partner and I ate here after a recommendation from a tour guide. We read that it is sometimes impossible to get a table, I guess it's lucky we visited in December as we only had a wait 2 or 3 minutes to be seated in the busy restaurant.I felt we were a little rushed at all stages during our visit - we had barely sat down and opened our menus before being asked what we wanted to order. At least this meant we didn't have to wait long when we were ready.Although they had English menus, the specials were only written in Spanish and the waiters who served us knew very minimal English - lucky I had the Microsoft translation app which lets you take a photo of a page of text and gives a near perfect translation.The food was tapas of decent serving sizes and very high quality, all very reasonably priced."
950,6-12-2017 ,5.0,"This place is buzzing with excitement. Although it is crowded, the service is good but reservations are a must. My wife and I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere."
951,5-12-2017 ,5.0,"I think it's one of the best restaurants from Barcelona and it is not so expensive as well.They have a lot of tapas, I would definetly recomend the '' Boqueron tapas '', '' Spanish tortilla '', and the plate of hams."
952,5-12-2017 ,5.0,Here you’ll find all the ingredients to be of the freshest quality. This place doesn’t take reservations. Give your name and wait for it to be called. Always busy so expect a wait. The steak and shrimo montaditos are great. Eggs with fries are so delicious. Try any other seafood that you may care for.
953,4-12-2017 ,5.0,We ate tapas at several restaurants. Most restaurants served the same ones but Cerveceria Catalana had the biggest variety and great quality. We had to wait - sat at the bar - but it was worth the wait!
954,3-12-2017 ,4.0,"After dining at the Vintus, I was heavy suggested by the various customers, staff, and recommendations from friends I was finally convinced to check out. Initial stop was around 8PM, the place was packed so it must be just as good or better than Vinitus. I was able to grab a counter seat within about a 10-minute wait. Service was very quick and accommodating despite the busy traffic as the staff was able to cater to each and every guest. The food & wine was on-point with a very extensive choice of options to include some items as only a daily special. From the meats, seafood, veggies, and cheeses they offered was well worth it, including the pairing. With very reasonable prices just like Vinitus, I was able to heart my heart away."
955,2-12-2017 ,4.0,"Based on a trusted friend's advise, I visited Cerveceria Catalan with another friend. The food was nice, I had a pepper steak, some shrimps and a sea food salad. A cup of wine too. The food was tasty and the price was ok. We had a dessert later, it was fine too. The only setback was the no ingles waiters ... "
956,1-12-2017 ,5.0,The best tapas I have ever taste!More than friendly staff!!excellent choices!local cuisine!best tapas and catalan cuisine
957,1-12-2017 ,5.0,"The experience was great, the staff helpful as this was our first time. The menu was in ESP, ENG, CAT. All the staff spoke English. Being an ignorant American and only speaking one language it was great for a first time experience with tapas to have them able to communicate. The food was great, especially the squid, but don’t leave before you try the bread pudding for desert.It is my understanding that there can be as much as an hour wait, we were fortunate and were seated immediately... could be time of day 6:30pm or time of year a Thursday at the end of November. It is right next to the Hilton Alexandria."
958,1-12-2017 ,3.0,We went here on our first night having read the good reviews but it was just so so. perhaps as we were earlier in the evening? Potatoes Bravas were nondescript. It is a pretty place but just was forgettable. 
959,30-11-2017 ,5.0,"This was the place to go for great tapa - but in a sit-down style. The place gets really crowded but the food is worth the wait. We enjoyed our Rabas De Calamar, Gambas Al Ajillo M Cuatro Quesos. The casa (house) wine was also very reasonable and delicious"
960,30-11-2017 ,4.0,This place is very good but is almost the same menu as their sister restaurant Vinitus. Everything is excellent but we had gone to Vinitus the day before so we had a few appetizers and drinks and went somewhere else. Food is excellent just pick one of the two to go to if your only there for a few days. 
961,30-11-2017 ,5.0,"Every time we are in town we go to eat the this place. Waiting time may be long up to one hour. However, once you are in there, you sure will enjoy the environment and the excellent food. The price is right and you feel you money has paid one of the best meals in town."
962,30-11-2017 ,5.0,"I think it is a must go. We love this place. Everyone can find smth for himself. Try mini hamburgers! I am not a fan of hamburgers,but love it!"
963,28-11-2017 ,4.0,"Given the location near the Gaudi houses and the richer neighborhood, it seems to be more of a high end tapas in a wealthy neighborhood. There were many locals than tourists hete which seemed to be a good sign. You can order from the menu and/or order tapas at the bar and give your table number. We liked anything that was a shrimp skewer...i think we got mushrooms and artichoke. It was so succulent. We got the patatas bravas and the padron peppers too. "
964,28-11-2017 ,5.0,"Had dinner here with colleagues, one of them from Barca recommended it. It was super busy with many locals, forgot what i ate but it was all great. But i do want to recommend the mushrooms the were amazing!! Dont know why only 6 reviews of this place, but means less touristy at least"
965,28-11-2017 ,5.0,"The queues are big here for a reason! 40 minute wait for a table on a Friday evening so we put our name down, went for a glass of wine around the corner and came back. Food was delicious, well cooked and the staff were very helpful and friendly (and also able to advise on which dishes contained allergens). Despite the queues, when we got our table, the service wasn’t rushed and the food was worth the wait. The calameres and the gambas al ajillo in particular went down well! The restaurant is quite modern too - great place for a Friday night. "
966,27-11-2017 ,4.0,"It was recommended by one of my friends, so I decided to go and check it out.The restaurant was quite busy and I found a spot at bar counter which I directly took.The server Amy was great handling all the enquiries as people you have a huge selection of tapas and other tradicional dishes to choose from .... delicious !I strongly recommend the hot three cheese taps and jamón serrano tapa yummy ! Also try the double malt beer Voldamm ! "
967,26-11-2017 ,5.0,"Loved this place! I found this place after doing research online from varies places. I also met a girl in the airplane that lives in Barce that recommended it. Must have the pitcher of sangria. The ham, cheese and tomato bread! "
968,25-11-2017 ,5.0,"Recommended by others in our independent tour group, Cerveceria lived up to our expectations. We bypassed the long waiting line by sitting outside which was comfortable on the cool side.. We had a series of delicious tapas including grilled eggplant and other vegetable topped with goat cheese, an asparagus mix, cod on skewers and pork tenderloin Would definitely recommend if you are staying in this area."
969,24-11-2017 ,5.0,"We went back to this restaurant 2 nights in a row. The food was excellent and the wait staff very helpful and friendly. They helped us understand the menu and made good suggestions to meet our requests. Perfectly cooked beef tenderloin tapas as well as scampi skewers, calamari, tomato and feta salad and more."
970,23-11-2017 ,5.0,"The place is super good!That’s y it’s always packed!The best tactic is to come early with the intention of waiting looooong time for a table, or just stalk the bar n hop on as soon as chairs become available!Everything they make is tasty, so try it all."
971,23-11-2017 ,5.0,"If there were not so many wonderful restaurants in Barcelona, we would definitely have come here again. Had to wait at the bar for a table, but that in itself was an adventure. This was our first restaurant meal of our trip so our first Catalan experience. Highly recommend this place. "
972,23-11-2017 ,4.0,"All the tapas we tried were good except the feta sallad which was not made of feta cheese at all but some kind of fresh cheese which was not even close to feta. Staff ok, atmosphere ok. Overall good. Count with a bill of about 40-50 Euros for two persons not including alcohol if you go for a regular tapas lunch/dinner."
973,23-11-2017 ,5.0,"Such a good tapas place, good products & low prices ! Kind staff and good vibes, I recommand this place"
974,22-11-2017 ,5.0,"We had dinner at the restaurant. Took vegetarian food which was all very tasty, and deserts that were great. The service was good and fast yet not very warm."
975,21-11-2017 ,5.0,"I will not mention the food, service, price etc. Let me give the story away. Today we wanted to try a new tapas place and it was a fancy one. So called one of the best and preferred by locals. Come on! Not even close to this place at all.Great food, great dessert, great service, great ambiance for nice price. Never ever skip this restaurant if you are in Barcelona."
976,21-11-2017 ,3.0,"My expectation for this place was high, look at all the great reviews.I feel like I was at McDonalds, the food and service was so impersonal.I feel they wanted us to order fast, eat fast and move on. The few waiters that served us were all bored, I get the sense they can’t wait for us to go and doesn’t care to explain their dishes to another tourist.Our dishes was pretty but the taste was dull, bland, soul less. Maybe the place is now famous for being famous and no longer cares if they are"
977,19-11-2017 ,1.0,"I have no idea what's the fuzz about.. the restaurant is far from being authentic.. so mediocre.. hot tapas were cold, service is lower than average.. food is not fresh.. can't believe whats the people are talking about! And it's expensive if you decided to drink .. charged me 12 euros for the sangria which was very average! "
978,19-11-2017 ,5.0,"Best tapas in Barcelona, and a very affordable price ! We really liked this restaurant and I’m sure you will have great time there ! "
979,18-11-2017 ,5.0,"Friendly, efficient, responsive and patient staff. The restaurant is very big and seems always full. We were lucky to get a big table for our group and we were really amazed by the selection on the menu. My personal favorite is ""Cabreaous"" in egg style, fried egg on top of some fried potatoes and mixed. The portion was pretty generous too and we love their Sangria. Definitely worth a visit while in Barcelona!"
980,18-11-2017 ,5.0,"Visited 6 good tapas restaurants in Barcelona in a week, and this has got to be the best of it all! The drinks, the food, the ambience, are definitely what you wanna go for in this beautiful city. Its always busy after 8, even on weekdays. Go early, or wait. Even when its crowded, you will still enjoy your time there, comfortably. Definitely will visit everytime i am in Barcelona!!"
981,17-11-2017 ,5.0,"We came here after reading lots of reviews on tripadvisor and wow we were not disappointed, the baby squid and grilled prawn skewers were to die for! Not to be missed if your in Barcelona."
982,15-11-2017 ,4.0,"You have to get there earlier since they do not take reservations, we were lucky to find a spot in the bar which makes our experience really enjoyable, our service was kind and fast and the food was pretty good and fresh, great tapas!"
983,15-11-2017 ,5.0,"Was advised to go early to this place as it gets very busy. You can't miss it right next to the bright red Vodafone store. Arrived just before 6pm and got a seat at the bar, no worries. Very friendly greeting, yes they have an English menu.Make sure you try the eggs ""Cabreaos"" that come with a little show from the waiter! The razor clams ""Navajas"" are not on the menu but were a highlight (€9.25) - I'd seen them pictured on the reviews. The andaluz anchovies were fresh and tasty. There was no need to go past the house beer (€2.50). So good I went back again on another night where it was equally great. So much to try!!!"
984,14-11-2017 ,5.0,"It was fair to say this was the best food in Barcelona. Our tapas was incredible. They don’t take reservations as they are so busy, it’s a first come first served basis. But well worth it. We came last Saturday night, we were told by the lady it was a 20 minute wait, she took our name down and we came back 20 minutes later and it was packed! However as soon as we walked in, she called my name and told us our table was ready, I didn’t even have to say anything! The prawns skewers and escalivda goats cheese tapas and bread pudding desert were my absolute favourites. 100% would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. "
985,14-11-2017 ,5.0,"Before going to Spain, I was given at least two recommendations from my reviews and when my wife and I were in Barcelona recently, we finally got to try out this restaurant. As advertised, this was an excellent restaurant to have either lunch or dinner. We went there for dinner. Luckily we got there around 6:45 pm which is considered early in Spain for dinner and we had no problem getting a table. The menu was quite extensive with lots of good choices. We ordered Tapas sampler ( as recommended by my source), some open sandwiches, and Sangria for drink. We truly enjoyed our selections and topped it off with Crema Catalana, the classic Barcelona dessert. The price was more than reasonable for the location and the ambience. By the time we were leaving, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated. I would go back to this restaurant any day in Barcelona."
986,14-11-2017 ,5.0,"Awesome foods, it is worth to hold in the long line for the delicious. On the other hand, due to the wide business hours, diners are able to enjoy the delicious without crowded time like the hour before the noon."
987,11-11-2017 ,4.0,"We went late at night so we only had to wait 30 minutes. It was odd but the menu here was exactly the same as Vinitus’. Not sure if they are owned by the same company or person. Nevertheless, was great! We didn’t order much here but the manchego and the shrimp skewers. Shrimp was super yummy! "
988,11-11-2017 ,1.0,"Bad customer service and the food was not good at all. Very disappointed. Not worth going there, there are a lot of better places to dine. "
989,11-11-2017 ,3.0,"We wen't to Cerveceria Catalana on our recent trip to Barcelona, a couple of friends recommended the place as one of the most typical places, so we included it in our ""musts"" list. The place does not accept booking, so when we arrived (around 8pm) the place was completely crowded with lines of people waiting (mostly tourists), we decided to wait in line and have to say that even if the host advised we would wait for 40min, actually was less. The menu has all the typical tapas and pinchos, so i was expecting that ""real flavour"", unfortunately the truth is that the food was average... maybe because of the amount of people the preparations are made very quickly and you can notice by the service and the platters of shrimps, calamari etc crossing the hall to get to the kitchen that everything is done in mass. The sardines were chewy not crunchy, so obviously not fried at the moment, the calamari a bit greasy and flavorless and the desserts nothing special. The ""camarones al ajillo"", pincho de carne con foie and the papas bravas instead were very tasty. I hope they could maintain the quality of all the dishes even when the place is crowded."
990,9-11-2017 ,5.0,"This place is big and fast. They don't accept reservations however usually you don't wait long. Tapas is a dish which is so common in Barcelona and somehow you do not expect anything special. In this place you would say same on the first glance, however whatever I ordered was so good you just can't stop. Variety is huge but everything is very fresh. Try as many things you can. You won't be disappointed. Relatively cheap eat. Service is fast and professional. Highly recommended. Place not to be missed."
991,9-11-2017 ,4.0,"We traveled to Barcelona to meet friends. This restaurant was recommended to us also by friends who were in Barcelona the prior week. The restaurant was very busy even at 7:00 p.m.; which is very early for dinner in Barcelona. The service is fast, the Tapas is very good and they have a good selection of wines to accompany your meal. Go early if you want to get a table without having to wait. We will definitely go back to this restaurant the next time we visit Barcelona."
992,8-11-2017 ,4.0,"A high school friend 6,000 miles (and 45 years) away happened to notice on one of my social media posts that I was in Barcelona and insisted that we eat at Cerveceria Catalana. Of course, anybody who's been anywhere is going to be sending you ""…best ever!"" posts if they've been prior where you are currently, so I considered her recommendation but figured we'd never get here. However, one afternoon while planning our walk I noted that Cerveceria Catalana is just around the corner from one of Gaudi's masterpieces, Casa Mila, so we dialed it in for lunch. After wading through the crowd near the door and getting on the list for a table we waited a very short time until our name was called and were lead to the center of the room near a curious refrigerator apparatus with glass front that looked like an art display. The table was actually a six-top with a couple of local gentlemen sitting next to us across from the empty pair of seats. The guys looked to be having a great time ordering multiple dishes, sharing and discussing the merits of each. When the locals are excited to eat somewhere you gotta be on the right track. After determining our path through the tapas menu we added a couple of items that the pair insisted we try and promised that we'd like. They were correct, and thereby validated the rule of thumb that you always follow the lead of the locals. With only one misstep, a much too oily sampling of fresh mushrooms (our choice, not theirs) the rest of the meal was quite good and well beyond the chain restaurant introduction to tapas we had the day prior. Thanks, Beth! See you at the 50th."
993,8-11-2017 ,4.0,"Food was very tasty however we got caught out thinking portions would be bigger but the bread tapas is a single portion, so order more! Prawns they were however, very generous with. Would go again "
994,8-11-2017 ,5.0,"This place looks busy and a bit frenzied upon arrival. However, it is worth joining the queue and getting your name down for a table - if there isn't a space at the bar. The staff are very efficient; we arrived at about 9.30pm one evening and were told to expect to wait for 50 minutes for a table. In reality we waited for about 25 minutes whilst we enjoyed a very reasonably priced glass of wine (c. €2.45).The menu is quite comprehensive and offers daily tapas in addition to other tapas dishes. There are also salads, bread etc. The tapas is the best I have had because it was full of flavour and not greasy and the dishes were a bit different. The service is fast, the atmosphere great, and the prices for such good quality pretty decent.We went back a second time!We went back a second night! "
995,7-11-2017 ,5.0,"We had the best, most freshest tapas here! Beautiful clean, modern restaurant and prompt serving of food! Loved everything we tried! "
996,6-11-2017 ,5.0,"Tried to get in at 8PM on a Friday and the wait was an hour. We went back on a weeknight and at 7PM had a 40 minute wait. You can sit outside, inside at the mini tapas bar or wait for a seat. It was so worth the wait. We asked our waitress for recommendations and had open minds to trying new dishes. The fried Camembert rolled in almonds with raspberry jam was the MOST delicious and decadent treat. We would have eaten 10 of them, but we had to keep trying other dishes. The eggplant and onion omelet wasn't pretty, but so yummy. The seafood was super fresh and the wait staff was friendly and really helpful. We even had dessert, which was also tapas sized, and the waitress was right to suggest the bread pudding. Best bread pudding I've ever had. The sangria was good, but the food and bustling atmosphere is why you have to come here! It's worth going back to Barcelona just to eat here again!"
997,6-11-2017 ,4.0,We went and ended up waiting 45mins for a seat but it was worth it. The food was really good. We would have eaten there again but we could not bring ourselves to wait that long again. If you go later (they close at 1am) there is less wait. The quality of the food is very good and the service is also good.
998,6-11-2017 ,5.0,"Ceveceria Catalana is my go to place for some great tapas, no fuss and brought to you quickly. Go for the classics like Tortilla and Jamon Iberico and mix it up a bit with their specialties. Good spot for people watching as well."
999,5-11-2017 ,5.0,"It was all worth it to walk from our apartment all the way to this restaurant. Everything was excellent!! The food was perfecto,friendly staff and very cozy place to dine in. We recommend this to everyone! We can't wait to go back!"
1000,5-11-2017 ,5.0,"Simply Bravo!Great food and lots of choices, great staff, great ambiance and top location!Gracias CC!"
1001,4-11-2017 ,5.0,"We were told a 40 minute wait, but were called after 15 minutes. The food arrived quickly, the atmosphere was incredible and the food was really tasty. Friendly staff. Well worth a visit. "
1002,4-11-2017 ,4.0,"Arrived at 19:00 and there was a 20 minute wait and it was well worth it. The place is fantastic, nice atmosphere and delicious tapas. Friendly staff too. Highly recommended by locals, this is the place to go in Barca for tapas "
1003,2-11-2017 ,5.0,"I called in here because separately I had seen good reviews on TA, read about it in Lonely Planet and had it recommended by a friend - so my expectations were high!The restaurant was more modern in appearance than I was expecting, but very smart with lots of very appetising food on display. Although the restaurant was busy, I was offered a seat at the bar and was served straight away by a very friendly bartender. I ordered the Selection of Tapas plate which turned out to be enormous! It arrived very quickly and was suitably delicious - although I did have ‘food envy’ when the lady sat next to me had the beef tenderloin! The bartender was just the right level of attentive - not too much but not ignoring me either, and it didn’t take much persuasion for me to have another beer and then follow it off with the superb Catalan biscuit ice cream and an espresso.Being sat at the bar I found a couple of friendly people to chat to also, which added to the evening.Well worth a visit! "
1004,2-11-2017 ,4.0,"We have been there twice during our 3-night stay in Barcelona and they offer many different kinds of tapas and a great deal of seafood and meat, so it's certainly a place to go for us as tourists. Obviously the atmosphere is a bit noisy as can be expected for such a hot restaurant with huge turnover of people. The beef is very juicy and the spanish ham is just great! Also the big shrimps are fresh and delicious. We also had a bottle of red wine there."
1005,1-11-2017 ,5.0,"Even my son liked the mini burger! Fantastic tapas and a fun scene. Just a great, typical Spanish tapas restaurant..."
1006,31-10-2017 ,5.0,"This is one of the best dinners that I’ve had in a long time. This place is inexpensive for what you get. The seafood is fresh: shrimp, clams, and anchovies were delicious. The steak medallions were cooked perfectly to my liking. I even had the foie gras for the first time and it was also very good. YOU WON’T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1007,31-10-2017 ,5.0,"Food is excellent, service helpful, fast and competent. Tapas were the best we ever ate, very fresh sea food. "
1008,31-10-2017 ,5.0,"We sat at the bar. Picked 6 tapas on display, all wonderful, and then we asked our bartender/ waiter to recommend some dishes and wow! Mushrooms and asparagus; steak and chicken liver, calamari and shrimp, and then egg caballeros! I’m sure he could have came up more great offerings but we were stuffed. 2 persons, 3 drinks, a wonderful little tapas chocolate desert $55E. Easily the best food we had in Spain. "
1009,31-10-2017 ,5.0,"We came here as it was very close to Casa Mila and for the great reviews on Trip Advisor. The Tapas Sampler was delicious and a good deal and the razor clams were cooked to a perfect tenderness. They don't take reservations, but if you come around 11am in October, they can sit you right away. Highly recommend!"
1010,30-10-2017 ,5.0,"first-you must make a reservation for dinner and lunch. We benn their at 1pm and at 5pm and we should not have reservations. But from 2 to 4pm and for dinner is very croudy.But it's worth it. The best tapas are here. They have everything very fresh. We eat , sworfish, mussels, beefsteak with liver and many other tapas and they were phenomenal. Prices are great."
1011,30-10-2017 ,5.0,We didn’t book and sat outside on a Sunday evening rather than waiting 20 mins for a table inside. We were very politely asked if it was ok the same table was booked in 2 hours - good that it was mentioning and we had plenty of time. We simply chose from the tapas menu and had a few beers and Cava. Everything was delivered promptly and the dishes were delicious. A nice place overall and well worth a visit with very friendly waiting staff. 
1012,30-10-2017 ,5.0,"Amazing food, amazing service. VERY LONG WAIT- we tried the first night and there was a three hour wait and the second time was an hour wait. Exquisite and a must try if you have the time to wait."
1013,29-10-2017 ,5.0,"This is one of my favourite places in Barcelona, as the food is delicious. The quality is always good, fast service, and fun atmosphere. It might be very crowded most of the time but the wait is worth it."
1014,28-10-2017 ,5.0,"Sat at the tapas bar, asked the chef to choose ; superb plates, exquisite flavors fair price Will return and recommend "
1015,27-10-2017 ,4.0,"We came for a late lunch. We were seated promptly. The service was as attentive as it could be in a large space with many tables. The decor was attractive, neat, and unobtrusive. Our tapas came promptly and were very tasty. I would return the next time in Barcelona."
1016,26-10-2017 ,4.0,The tapas were good and the service excellent.They have a various type of fish food and the place is pretty big.Nevertheless you'll find more tourists than locals.
1017,25-10-2017 ,1.0,"Very busy place so we didn't wait the first time we went but came back next night earlier. Food was very ho-hum at best. We felt totally rushed. As soon as a plate was finished someone took it away. Seemed like they just wanted to rush you out so they could put someone else into the seat. Not a relaxing place for dinner, sustinance only."
1018,25-10-2017 ,4.0,Glad we went early (7:00 P) for dinner. Was able to get table for two right away. Food was good - had sardine and vegetable tapas with sangria.
1019,24-10-2017 ,4.0,"Similar to many of the other reviews on here this place was really busy upon our arrival. We had a wait of around 20 minutes at 9:30pm even though the waiter said it would be a 45 minute wait, although we had to share a table with a gentleman who was eating on his own.All the usual tapas was on offer and the food was of real good quality but the portion sizes were not great.Lovely fresh food and good service.Restaurant was smart and tidy."
1020,23-10-2017 ,5.0,"This was our first tapas restaurant that we went to on our trip and was recommended by our hotel (which was a few blocks away). We only had to wait about 10 minutes or so, probably because we went before the dinner rush (before 7 pm). The service was very good although it took a while to get our last dish. Everything was tasty and we enjoyed the patatas bravas, mini hamburgers, sausage & cheese and fried camebert we ordered."
1021,23-10-2017 ,4.0,Very popular place with quick and good service. Classic tapas menu but with subtle a twist. If early you can get a table without queuing.
1022,23-10-2017 ,5.0,"This restaurant was fully booked almost every night, but luckily in our last night in Barcelona we finally managed to get a table. The atmosphere and decoration is classy and spatious, no need to sit elbow to elbow with the neibourgh. Food is absolutely delicious, the staff is efficient and friendly; it can be seen that they are please to work in this restaurant. This visit made us very happy in many ways :)"
1023,23-10-2017 ,3.0,2nd time we visited this restaurant for tapas. Food consistently good...service consistently terrible. Not many vegetarian selections. Will not go back due to service.
1024,23-10-2017 ,4.0,"Nice tapas at the bar. Great calamari, scribs and patatas bravas. Reasonable prices for Barcelona. Must go..."
1025,22-10-2017 ,3.0,"Really busy restaurant, tapas were ok, but not really very good.We have seen a lot of peolpe waiting outside, but I really believe this restaurant is highly overrated, we have had so much better tapas before in other restaurants! We will not go again to this restaurant!"
1026,22-10-2017 ,3.0,"This place is very popular because it has a very big selection of tapas. There are also quite a few daily specials. On the weekends and evenings it is very hard to get a table. You may have to wait up to one hour. The food is quite OK in terms of taste and rather small portions. In fact, I had already eaten better tapas at other places."
1027,22-10-2017 ,5.0,We met a friend that recommend this restaurant The restaurant is crowded but quick serve. The prawn skewer is my favorite. Beef and foi gras is nice. Totally recommend the razor clam!! We order them twice for razor clam and prawn.
1028,20-10-2017 ,5.0,"In my opinion, this is the best food, and the best value for the food, in Barcelona. The quality is 100% consistent. The service is friendly. The portions are not stingy. Hence, the best restaurant in Barcelona, as far as I am concerned. I had very mixed experiences in the other Barcelona restaurants I tried, in fact, they were all a disappointment, and one was a real gouger on price. I had five days in Barcelona and I ate here five times, need I say more?!It gets very busy for lunch and dinner, so my tip to you is go in about 11 to 11:30 for a nice brunch, or no later than 6 for an early dinner. Otherwise, be prepared for a long wait."
1029,20-10-2017 ,4.0,"La Cerverceria Catalana is a very busy tapas bar in the Eixample district. We actually had to drop by a second time in order to be able to experience this place. We were fortunate that as we entered a couple of stools became available; it is actually entertaining to sit at the counter as you can see all the actions and ask questions to the waiters as they serve out the various dishes. The selection is vast so it is easy to avoid all the awful fried tapas or the ones presented on a “thick” piece of bread. They offer wonderful mushrooms and seafood plates including razor clams (navajas).Above all the feel of the place is really nice, the waiters are smiling although they are real busy. The quality of the food is good at a reasonable price. Recommended tapas bar to experience Barcelona among locals and tourists."
1030,20-10-2017 ,5.0,"I won't add much new to all the excellent reviews.. we loved this place so much we ate here on three separate occasions over the weekend.Very friendly and efficient staff. All dishes tried were excellent.Particular mention to: Sardines & fried white fish ( whitebait) Grilled cuttlefish and Octopus, green peppers..Followed by (I think a speciality dish of theirs ) a dessert of St Theresa ( a reinvention of bread and butter pudding but on a completely different level ) Soooo good.Go early (pre 7 pm) if you don't want to wait more than 1 hour for a table."
1031,20-10-2017 ,5.0,Another spot that deserves its strong reviews. Menus in English which always helps. Great choice. Great atmosphere. Try get a seat at the bar and watch the dishes getting replenished whilst trying to figure out how the staff remember who's had what. Bigger groups give your name at the entry and get added to the waiting list and then they call out your name when they have space.
1032,19-10-2017 ,5.0,For me it was the best food in town.I didn’t liked that they didn’t want to make a reservation for the next day. The concierge told me to come the next day in person to make a reservation.And I did.
1033,18-10-2017 ,4.0,This place gets very busy and you will probably need to wait. Locals eat a bit later so go early and you're more likely to wait for less time. At one visit we were asked if we would share a table - this was fine as it meant 2 couples sharing a six seater table. Staff are very knowledgeable and will happily help you out with menu. You can sit at the bar to eat and you can see dishes in front of you. You can then just point to what you want until you feel more confident eating tapas. The menu has an English translation but you may need to take a chance with how it is prepared. All the food we had was delicious. I loved the chips with fried eggs chopped over them and this was a popular dish at most tapas bars
1034,18-10-2017 ,5.0,"Have tried many restaurant in the world ranging from street food -> michelin star resto.For me Catalana is the best resto in the world.Just close your eyes, point anything in their menu and I can assure you it will be excellent "
1035,18-10-2017 ,4.0,"The place is nice and service is great. Its a tapas place for tourists, but the food quality is good and the prices are not that far from other places. Its a good place for a first tapas experience and if you need recommendations.You have some time to wait as every time we went through it was packed...but its big enough to have a bunch of people in. Just do not think of getting seated right away if you go there. You can sill have a drink maybe if its not packed enough to have people eating at the bar!"
1036,18-10-2017 ,5.0,"Located in the very heart of L'Eixample, Cerverseria Catalana summarises Barcelona at its best. With the best tapas in town and probably the best sangria there is, this place is an absolute must when visiting this city. Be warned that the place is PACKED during lunch and dinner hours, so be sure to arrive early or just arm yourself with patience as there will be a long queue at the entrance. Prices are not outrageous and quality and a good time are guaranteed! Service is fast and friendly and the ambience just shouts CATALONIA every single minute. You must go here when in town."
1037,16-10-2017 ,3.0,"Very traditional tapas menu.... strange to have the exact same menu as we had at ciudad condal... was expecting even better after reading TA comments. In the end ""just fine"" but not much more, so slightly disappointed. "
1038,16-10-2017 ,5.0,"We were in the area of this tapas restaurant around 2.30pm one afternoon and were thinking about something to eat!We had heard this was favourite with the locals so off we went.No wonder,when we arrived there was a queue and waiting for around 20 minutes.The restaurant must cater for around 300 persons at any one time,so this was of huge interest as how the kitchen could cope.Well,we were treated extremely politely whist waiting and when seated the order was taken once we had decided.We agreed we would ""graze through the menu"",as that's the best way to eat Tapas-Stop when enough,if you can.The food did not disappoint and of course we ate too much-nothing more in the evening.Dont miss this one if you are in Barcelona,you will be pleased to have been there."
1039,16-10-2017 ,5.0,"It was our first night in Barcelona, and wanted an early dinner to get us through jet lag. Because we went early, we got right in to enjoy a bottle of wine and delicious tapas. The eggplant chips were a favorite, but it was all delicious. Fortunately, the waiter spoke English. We had fun taking turns going up to the bar to choose the tapas. Then, we gave them our table number and the food came to our table. The red wine sangria and white wine sangria looked delicious at the next table over, and we hope to try it on another visit. By the time we left, there was a line waiting to get in."
1040,16-10-2017 ,5.0,"This is the one of the best places for visitors to experience the great tapas that Barcelona has to offer. No tapas experience should go without a plate of olives and a glass of local red wine. We tried many dishes but especially loved the beef tenderloin “sliders” that they call mini hamburgers. We also tried the Langostinos (shrimps) and they were delicious. We had the fried green mini peppers which were Catalonian but not to our liking. We did enjoy the Catalonian creme which was wonderful ending to our evening. You either need to go early or be prepared for a long wait as this is a very popular restaurant. If you have to wait, it will definitely be worth it!!"
1041,15-10-2017 ,5.0,Great food and quality ingredients. Good service. Sit at the bar to fully experience the Spanish tapas culture. The crispy Camembert and honey cod were my favourites!I recommend getting there early if you don’t want to queue. 
1042,15-10-2017 ,3.0,Nonstop tapas during stay in Barcelona. One of restaurant that you must be try when you travel in here. And don't forget to stay in the bar count for order the food that the staff can easy to give you the recommendation !!!
1043,14-10-2017 ,5.0,I have been to this restaurant many times and the experience has always been great. The quality of the food is excellent and the prices very reasonable. The only downside is the wait due to the huge amount of patrons that visit this place all the time. I would recommend to come here really early or really late to avoid the wait.
1044,13-10-2017 ,5.0,"What a lovely restaurant. We had to wait 50 mins but it was worth it. The staff were lovely and the food was amazing, delicious xx"
1045,12-10-2017 ,5.0,"amazing people around all the time, delicious food, incredible service. love to come back and definitely recommend"
1046,12-10-2017 ,5.0,"Must go too restaurant in Barcelona,recommended by a friend,who had been twice.Huge queue when we arrived told to return in half an hour,and as we were leaving waiter called us over sat us straight down on table for 5.lucky.....From then on feast of food.seafood.meat vegetables all brilliant..staff super friendly super helpful...i had two 50 euros stuck together.waiter very kindly returned to say i had paid to much.We will 100% be returning...as we left at 11 o clock restaurant full and still a queue for tables.."
1047,12-10-2017 ,3.0,"We went there due to the good reviews, but I felt very disappointed by the food. I didn't mind waiting an hour to get a table outside, but the food lacked taste.We had some boiled king prawns with olive oil which had not been deveined prior to cooking (the tract had broken during the cooking process and the taste was just horrible). The rest of the plates (not worth mentioning each because I believe they are all the same) lacked flavor. For the visitors, I reccomend a little place called Can Maño, not soffisticated, but truly tasty!"
1048,11-10-2017 ,4.0,"We went to cerceria Catalana on a Monday night at around 8pm and waited around 1 hour to get a table for 7 people.The food was godd, as was the Cava, served in fancy bottles that ended up not being to expensive.The waitresses were quite tired, a bit too rough and cranky at times. Overall, the prices were ok, a bit too expensive for the food, but definitely cheap for the location and room quality."
1049,11-10-2017 ,5.0,I am tapas lover and I can tell you that this place ranks very high in my list of top prefered places in Barcelona. Yes tourists and visitors like me tend to dominate the scene but locals still love the place. Actually 2 good friends of mine living in BCN praised this restaurant so much that I had to try.The fish is so fresh that's just fabulous food. Loved it !
1050,10-10-2017 ,4.0,We showed up on the day we arrived and unfortunately were too hungry and tired to wait 45 minutes for a table. The next day we showed up and were greeted by a waitress asking us to sit at the counter. It was perfect! We enjoyed the mushrooms and the razor clams and a few other delicious items. Not expensive at all. Quite an experience and worth the wait.
1051,10-10-2017 ,5.0,"This is one of the best tapas restaurants in Barcelona, and is well known by many. There is effectively the tapas area on entry where there are around 15-20 bar stools seated in front of a huge range of various different tapas dishes on view to choose from, or a seated restaurant area at the rear of the facility seating many more covers. The tapas area is more often than not completely full, due to the standard and choice provided; it seems that here is plate after plate of different dishes to choose from which are replaced frequently as and when they are used up. This is absolutely a place not to be missed and for the restaurant, there is definitely a need to make a reservation in advance if you do not want to have a lengthy wait for a table or you don't want to be disappointed with the fact that it is often fully booked; for the tapas seating, due to the numbers using the restaurant, you just have to rely on luck to get a seat on a bar stool when they are not so busy (mid afternoon after 14.30 hrs would be a good time to try. One point for those with mobility issues; the restrooms are upstairs, and I didn't notice any lifts provided to access these. You won't be disappointed with this place for sure....................."
1052,10-10-2017 ,4.0,"This venue gets crowded fast, so if you don't want to eat around 9 PM like the locals, head there a bit earlier around 6 or 7 to get a table. Tapas are tasty, well portioned and priced affordably. There is also a great local wine list, also reasonably priced. We are not seafood consumers (there is a lot on the menu), but there were plenty of other tasty options from your typical patatas bravas to jamon iberico and blistered peppers. There were plenty of locals, which is always a plus that it is not catering to tourists. A bottle of wine and six tapas cost us around $60 for two persons. The same quality meal at the tapas restaurant that we frequent in the U.S. costs us about $120."
1053,10-10-2017 ,4.0,"Busy, vibey, great tapas along with friendly service. We shared the tapas taster menu and ordered extra steak and foie grois, which just melted in your mouth. Yum."
1054,9-10-2017 ,4.0,"We went there twice last week, and we had to wait at least 30 mins to get our table. The restaurant was full of people all the time. There were two queues for table, one for the restaurant inside and the other was for the very few open tables. We got our table earlier on the outside queue. We tried different types of tapas and most of them were good, especially its seafood. Service could be better as too few staff for so many customers."
1055,9-10-2017 ,5.0,"... Tapa Bar in Barcelunya. Come early, or bring enough time with you. It seems that everybody wants to eat here, and they know why. All on the menu is recommendable. Very good wines too.When you come and the line is to long, outside is a waiter with a waiting list. You'll find something around the corner to visit and spend the waiting period."
1056,9-10-2017 ,5.0,"My favourite restaurant experience of Barca.So busy, but worth getting there early to getz ahead of the crowds. Yes lots of tourists but the food is great' and fab value so worth the effort.I would opt for a counter rather than table. Bteer experience more fun. Go for left hand side as you ente (kitchen is this side)Forget queing at Cal Pep, this half the price and food is arguably better.I ate here 3 times in 6 days."
1057,8-10-2017 ,4.0,"We visited the Cerveceria Catalana for lunch on a Sunday and was able to get a table outside for 3 in about 10 minutes. We ordered Spanish omelette which came with tomato/olive oil bread, fried hot peppers, shrimp tapas, and a couple of lemon beers. The food was delicious and the lemon beers were very refreshing. Great ambience and fantastic food."
1058,8-10-2017 ,4.0,Very nice and good local food (Spanish tapas). Very busy place and you need to be on time. Report inside to the hostess to be on the waiting list in order to be seated. Once at your table the service is quick. The food is great incl the wine. 
1059,7-10-2017 ,4.0,"I've heard that this restaurant was so famous. I visited here so many people were waiting and we were waiting for over 90min, but I don't think that it was worth it even though one couple said to us it was worth waiting when they went out. If you don't need to wait, I highly recommend you visit to here, otherwise you should visit the other nice restaurant around here."
1060,6-10-2017 ,5.0,We (12 of us) went there around 4pm and waited about 30 mins for the table.. food was great and yummy... it is Near to Casa Mila & Casa Batllo.. 
1061,6-10-2017 ,2.0,"Reeled in by waiter... as soon as we sat down i noticed the table cloth very stained. They were busy but i asked for it to changed, but was ignored , they were changing others tho.Then the meal , my friend enjoyed hers, but mine quite frankly was a joke. Cold chips , no meat on chicken all skin and bones and a salad on side the size of a coin. The water prices were a rip off so i declined a drink...I couldn't eat the meal it was terrible. I refused to pay as i had not eaten anything. I paid for the tapas which i had given to my friend. The waiter said he would call the police on me, he knew i was in the right but was a horrible man, the manager came over and i explained the situation but still was made out to be the awkard one. I told the manager about the cloth and showed him, but not that interested in my upset plight. I left the money for what i had had and walked off. My friend without me knowing was bullied into paying the difference which later caused a rift between us. We were only in barcelona for 1 day and it really spoiled it. Theres plenty to choose from , give this a miss. Especially if you have children or it will cost you dearly. Terrible customer service skills, unless your spanish ."
1062,5-10-2017 ,5.0,We stumbled upon this restaurant hungry and hit the food jackpot! It was sooo delicious we just allowed our waiter to order everything for a party of 4 and it was all bliss! Cannot fault the huevos something was so different for us and prawns were so so fresh and full of flavour. Would def come back if I visited Barcelona again.
1063,5-10-2017 ,5.0,"Went with a friend who insisted on trying their spaghetti with eggs she's heard of. We arrived at high noon, a long queue was there, but we weren't in hury so we waited, eventually to sit outside like we wanted :-) The staff was absolutely nice and friendly, she ordered her spaghetti and I took the ""assorted tapas"" - and it was delicious, it was very pleasant to be there, even though it may have seen overcrowded from the queue's side, when seated it was lovely. The food was fresh, great and I want to go back there! BTW for dessert we ordered something chocolaty (I don't remember what) and it was absolutely perfect. I highly recommend this restaurant. NOTE: the toilets are on a second floor, so take that into consideration."
1064,5-10-2017 ,5.0,"We always love the food here and this visit was no different- great meats, fish, just great tapas.The only difficulty is getting in. Cerveceria seems to have developed a huge following that makes for 45 minute to an hour wait anytime you go. That's great for them, but hard to carve that big of a chunk out of the middle of the day for lunch.Still love it, though!"
1065,5-10-2017 ,4.0,I found this place on TripAdvisor. It was close to where we were staying.It was very busy and deserved to be. The tapas and the sangria were both very good.A number of the patrons are regulars so that's always a good sign.
1066,4-10-2017 ,5.0,"We arrived at our hotel late on a Friday evening and asked the staff where we could eat nearby. They recommended Cerveseria Catalana as having the best tapas in Barcelona! Within 5 minutes we had found it and it was heaving even though it was 11pm! We put our names down for a table in the restaurant and waited at the bar for about 30 minutes. The time passed quickly as we chatted to a French couple who were dining at the bar and recommended dishes for us to try. We could also see the vast array of tapas at the bar counter where we could have eaten instead of waiting for a table. However, the table service was very good and the staff were pleasant even though they were very busy. The food was excellent - all the usual tapas dishes served very quickly. We visited again on our last day as it was the best place we could find locally to eat. Every time we walked by it was busy but don't be put off by that as it is worth the wait. Some say it is a touristy place but I would recommend it as it is very reasonably priced with great food and drink and a buzzing atmosphere."
1067,4-10-2017 ,5.0,"We came to the restaurant in the heat of the busy time. We sat at the bar, the servers were friendly, helpful and gave us some an amazing recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and our experience. "
1068,3-10-2017 ,5.0,"This is THE tapas bar!!! The line is long, but so worth it. Especially to sit at the bar section. You have to hover (rudely) over people in order to get that next seat since I believe it is first come first serve (for the bar). They have a huge display case of different tapas. It's overwhelming. Potatos Bravas, Mini Hamburgers, Iberian ham, Croquette...best. I'm not a big seafood eater, but everything my parents got (which was a lot) they loved.Can't go wrong here! Also, the earlier you go like at least 8, the less crowded since they don't eat dinner till late!"
1069,3-10-2017 ,5.0,Best Spanish catalan food in town they serve delicious Tapas. Best dish is Huevos Cabreados. The service is really good. The only bad thing is you can't make reservation an the waiting line can take an hour or more 
1070,3-10-2017 ,4.0,"Been there 4 times during our 6 days trip to Barcelona- in terms of quality of food there is nothing to criticize!Important information is that there is a long queue every day so it' really worth to come earlier. We were arriving around 6-6:30 PM for early dinner and because of this never waited longer than 20 minutes (two times even had a table without any wait).Our favorites were definitely beef steak tapas (fantastic quality of meat!), patatas bravas and small squids. Also great baguette with pork loin and cheese or with anchovies and eggplant plus some Greek salad- yummy! Lovely desserts - our favorite ones were coconut pudding and crema catalana.The only minus is with regards to how popular is this place... waiters doesn't seem like really interested in recommending you something or going an extra mile... every single time we were there we had impression that they want to serve us as quick as possible and just rotate tables faster and faster. Tapas of the day are only in Catalan so it's impossible to understand without help and recommendation but they were not really helpful so we were going for safe choices like mentioned before.Anyway, even including this, it's definitely a place to visit in Barcelona! Prices are ok- tapas mostly from €4 to €10, desserts €3 so dinner for two from €30 up to €40+ if you are very hungry :)"
1071,3-10-2017 ,5.0,This place is always packed - and now i know why. The food and staff are both amazing.We sat at the pinxtos bar and tried 4-5 different dishes. The waitress behind the bar was in complete command of her stage and offered suggestions. There are plenty of locals that go here - which is always a good sign.
1072,3-10-2017 ,5.0,Went to this place with my husband and kids we had to wait around 35 min to get a table. We finally did the table was well located and tables aren't very close to each other which I found convenient when you are with kids. Everything we tried was really delicious I highly recommend this place. It's a sharing concept so portions aren't very big
1073,3-10-2017 ,5.0,"Though we needed to wait for 45 mins during peak hours, it worths. As turnover is fast, food is fresh. Ambience is welcoming, staff are friendly. We went there again during non peak hours, we got sheltered table right away by road side."
1074,2-10-2017 ,3.0,Cerveceria catalana and ciutat comtal has the same menu. And nothing changed for many years. Very touristical place and so hard to have a table without any reservation. There are many tapas places in bcn but this one is a bit more famous for tourists. 
1075,2-10-2017 ,4.0,"This restaurant does not take reservations. We went at 630 pm and it was almost full.When you order your tapas, ignore the menu. Ask the waiter for your table number. Go to the tapas bar, tell them your table number and order what you like from the bar. They are more interesting than the menu."
1076,2-10-2017 ,4.0,"The food was great. The waiter that sits people in the table was a little intrusive, with some sarcastic jokes... but in general the service was good."
1077,1-10-2017 ,5.0,"We heard from friends that this was the place to go for a great selection of delicious tapas so we made it one of our first stops when we got into town. We tried several selections and they were all fantastic. We were not disappointed. In fact the food is so good that we went twice during our one week in Barcelona. You can’t beat the price either as you can eat until you’re stuffed for a very reasonable cost. Great selection of wines as well. It’s always busy so make a reservation. The waiters are very busy, but good. See attached receipt for some suggestions on what to order. "
1078,1-10-2017 ,5.0,"We arrived at Cerveceria Catalana at around 9pm and the place was packed! We put our name down, grabbed a waken nearby, and returned an hour later and the waiter had a table ready for us outside. The atmosphere is buzzing, waitstaff very professional and knowledgable, the menu is diverse without being too extensive and in typical Spanish style the drinks were generous. We had the chipirones (baby squid), patatas bravas (the best we had in Spain), jamon, fried cuttlefish, asparagus and mushrooms with garlic (yum!) and the fried cheese (Brie or Camembert) with raspberry jam- everything was delicious.Would definitely recommend this restaurant as a must visit in Barcelona. "
1079,1-10-2017 ,5.0,"Super busy cosmopolitan tapas restaurant, with high table turnover, meaning that the waits aren't that long and the food comes quickly -- hot, fresh, and good. We had the garlic shrimp, the sautéed cuttlefish, wild asparagus and mushrooms, and some fried potatoes, and a mini hamburger. The hamburger was the best but everything was great. Best sangria of our trip. Mmmmm sangria!Recommended. "
1080,1-10-2017 ,4.0,"Quite possibly the most beautiful thing I've ever eaten. A mix between a creme brûlée and bread and butter pudding (so if you don't like either, give it a miss). Also try the beef tenderloin. I ordered seconds! Have had better tapas experiences - this feels a bit like a production line - but individual moments of greatness."
1081,29-09-2017 ,4.0,"No one is exaggerating by calling this place the best Tapas in Barcelona, the quality of the food they serve is really high and the prices are sooo reasonable, the only reason I didn't rate this place as 5 star is the variety, Well they serve a lot of different stuff but to me only a few are food I would order when dinning outside.... ooh, and the octapus is just sooooo dddeeeelllliiiicccooouuussss. I should also mention that the service is really good and the staff speak english which helps alot when looking at food you are not familiar with ;) "
1082,29-09-2017 ,5.0,"I don't usually wait to get into restaurants, however this one came highly recommended by our guide during a food tour, so decided to give it a go. I am really glad we did as all the food we had was amazing. My favorite dish was the 'Montadito de solomillo con foie gras'! It's a must do for foie gras lovers. Sangria was also great! I would highly recommend waiting to get into this restaurant and going with an empty stomach!"
1083,28-09-2017 ,5.0,"Went here for lunch on a recommendation from someone who lives in Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed. It is busy so you will have to wait but well worth it. You can walk in and stand behind someone at the bar to take their seat when they are done or you can put your name on the list of a table inside or on a separate list for a table outside. We had a pasta salad, bravos, prawn skewer and grilled cuttlefish and for dessert we had an apple tartine and coconut pudding which was like a creme carmel and it was fabulous. Service was also very good."
1084,28-09-2017 ,4.0,"Recommended by a local taxi driver is really good authentic tapas restaurant good a fresh food, full bar and beer on tap extend menu with a lot of choices, pulpo a la gallega my favorite choice...very busy at noon and around 8:30pm"
1085,27-09-2017 ,5.0,"Me my wife and 1 year old son went to the restaurant on a recommendation for our hotel staff (OD Barcelona). The food was excellent, so was the sangria. very nice atmosphere and nice staff even while busy! I would Defiantly recommend "
1086,25-09-2017 ,5.0,"This was a reco from a friend I bumped into at BCN. Enjoyed our meal at this Tapas bar that we went back the following night the day before our train ride to Paris. Price point was just right for the quality of food and the service you get. The service staff were very attentive, friendly and makes your stay enjoyable. Suggest you come in early as this place tends to get a bit crowded by people waiting for a table. Though the staff seems to handle the queue well. Highly recommend!"
1087,25-09-2017 ,5.0,"We got lucky due to a super nice hostess who fast tracked us (20 minutes when wait time was otherwise 1 hour) because we hung around her and other parties were not showing up. That and she knew we were American and would not sit for 2 hours. The Tapas here was excellent, and the service and desserts better than similar places. You really need to make a reservation and show up on time."
1088,25-09-2017 ,5.0,"Now I know why so many people were waiting for a table. The food was excellent and the Filipino staff were very helpful in making our food choices. The seafood were really fresh and tasty. Particularly liked the shrimp and octopus. The grilled beef with foie gras and the fried camembert with almonds are to die for. The string potatoes with garlic oil and fried eggs were surprisingly delicious. Of course, the ham should not be missed out. Dont order everything all at once so you can figure out if the food is already enough. Order 1 serving each of your first few choices then order again as you eat. It does not take long for foid to be served."
1089,24-09-2017 ,4.0,This restaurant was close to our hotel and was packed every time we walked past. We went for dinner here and the tapas was good. The tables were a bit too close together but as people were queuing to get in more tables may have been added. I would have preferred to have been seated outside but As we had not made a reservation we were happy with what we got. I would return when in Barcelona agsin
1090,23-09-2017 ,4.0,"I found this place while watching YouTube vlogs on Barcelona. I came for the green onions and they were great and the portion was huge. We spent 30 euros on three tapas and one sangria glass. The prices are not as pricey as other places. This place I believe does not close so when we got hungry after touring Casa de Gaudi, which is semi-walking distance. Service is slow but we're American so I'm sure it's perfect per Barcelona standards. The vibe we got was a casual but trendy atmosphere. We also had our second meal outside. I got a little confused with the bread bites where you can have add ons. But those can get pricey with too many add ons. One piece of bread can go up to give euros. Food was great and we had a great time there."
1091,22-09-2017 ,5.0,"You will likely have to wait a while to get into this tapas restaurant, but the food is excellent. It is smilier to Ciudad Condal nearby, and quality is comparable. The atmosphere in this restaurant is probably a bit nicer, and the desserts are good. Sangria is excellent. It's a busy restaurant for a reason."
1092,22-09-2017 ,5.0,"Very busy but so worth the wait and great value for money. So many interesting tapas from shrimps and salmon to spanish tortilla, serrano, manchego and fantastic big green olives - and delicious thin slices of bread instead of the usual thick slices of soft white bread. Had very late dinner first and next day lunch."
1093,22-09-2017 ,3.0,"We arrived for lunch at 1230 and the restaurant was already busy, but we were seated quickly and efficiently.However, our waitress had virtually no customer service skills. As she was taking our order, she was looking around. She made no eye contact with us. I even asked her if she was listening to our order! The food came and it was absolutely delicious.The only positive response from our waitress was when she seemed happy after we paid the bill - maybe in the hope that we would leave a tip. We didn't.On reflection, maybe these people are not employed under good conditions?"
1094,21-09-2017 ,4.0,"It was a hazard to find a table in this restaurant, we waited 45 minutes but it was worth it. Once seated, the service is fast enough and the food was delicious. They offer an extend menu of choices so we ate everything hehe. The sangria was delicious. The place can held a lot of people and is very popular but also is very noisy. "
1095,21-09-2017 ,5.0,There are loads of places to have tapas in Barcelona but they're all the same. They look the same and they offer the same things. This place had a huge menu with loads of variety! Everytime we went there there was a wait as its so popular with the locals. It's not overpriced and you can be sure to be merry and stuffed for under €50. Go with plenty of time and an empty belly so you can try lots rather than just having croquettes and bravas! 
1096,20-09-2017 ,5.0,"The crowd around the door seemed ominous, but we left our names and started our 35 minute wait. Then after two minutes, we were told we could have a table if we would share it. We said yes, and were seated at a table for six with one other couple at the far end, so we still had privacy. The meal (tapas) was great, the service attentive and friendly. Definitely a food highlight of our trip. Give it a shot even if the crowds seem prohibitive, and you may get in sooner than you think."
1097,20-09-2017 ,5.0,"A bit of a wait but that's standard for good food, totally worth it! Waited for 20-30mins for a table for four inside. I didn't know what to get, so opted for the ""Assorted Tapas"" which was great value for money! The Catalonian style cream was a great dessert to finish off - similar to a cream brûlée. Service was fast! They had forgotten a tapa, but quickly got one straight away. Due to limited understanding English, they got confused and added the tapa on our bill, but the waiter quickly replaced the bill once he realised before any of us could check it. Thank you for the experience Cerveceria Catalana! "
1098,18-09-2017 ,5.0,"No way to make the booking there. But the stuff recomended us to come for brunch at that worked, we got the table in a second. Fresh and good cooked seafood and tapas. Just perfect. And yes, the service is very friendly."
1099,17-09-2017 ,5.0,"I got the info from a friend, go there and enjoy , That's the best publicity the word of the mouth Never Regret it Incredible food tapas to enjoy no matter what you choose even simple bread and tomato in different Of course, the staff is arrogant and always look tired as if they make you a favor It comes with fame I would look for it if I had another visit to Barcelona"
1100,17-09-2017 ,5.0,We tried different recommendations from books and from hotel concierge This was the best for tapas Just try to stay away from busy part of the day or you will wait up to two hours Great food and service Ask for recommendations from the waiters and always look around to see if you like something somebody else is eating During normal hours you could get in just after 10-15 minutes 
1101,16-09-2017 ,3.0,"We visited twice on our recent trip to Barcelona. Everything about the first time was amazing. Excellent, attentive service and delicious tapas. We returned for a second time on this basis and found the service was all over the shop. They got our order wrong, however we accepted the wrong dish as an extra we would pay for. We also ordered a cannelloni that was scalding hot on the outside and cold in the middle. When we explained this to the waitress, she said we should have said something sooner. We didn't make a fuss, but we're disappointed to see this item on the bill. I hope you get our first experience, not the second. "
1102,16-09-2017 ,5.0,We waited for 30 minutes but it was worth the wait. Great tapas and the service staff were helpful and attentive. Don't miss this when in Barcelona. 
1103,15-09-2017 ,5.0,"A great place for tapas. There were groups gathered on the sidewalk, I knew then my GPS had taken me to my destination. They had 2 waiting lists, and asked how long it would beif I wanted to sit at the bar. It took a minute and someone was paying their bill, vacating a perfect spot for me. I had foie, huevos cabreados (crispy French fries with a hotsauce and 2 fried eggs on top, and brie with nuts and cranberry, along with 2 beers. The bill 16 euros.Perfect food and lovely guests."
1104,15-09-2017 ,5.0,Best tapas so far and the best desert I've ever tasted! Will probably return tomorrow to try what I didn't have room for. I was told a 40 minute wait but was seated in 10. 
1105,15-09-2017 ,5.0,"We had drinks and appetizers at this bustling and happening cerveceria! It was 6 pm (very early for dinner in Barcelona) but this large restaurant was packed with a line out the door. Luckily two bar seats opened up and we had amazing red wines from the Rioja region and a variety of tapas such as calamari, scallops, tuna and the like.Tasty, fresh and very reasonable. Fun and lively while not too loud so you can still have a nice conversation with friends.I read about this restaurant in one of my travel magazines and it was a true find! Lots of locals were dining here so no touristy feel."
1106,13-09-2017 ,5.0,"I love visiting this place. Tapas are great but the desserts are the highlight. There is a waiting list usually, so try to come early."
1107,13-09-2017 ,5.0,"We heard about this place through our family. When we went there, the line and wait was tremendous. My wife hustled and found us two chairs by the bar which was very comfortable and we can view all the tapas. We had many sangrias on our trip , but the sangria here definitely deserves the praise ! Everything we ordered was delicious ! Our waiter/bartender was extremely catering and patient with us. I am not sure what his name is , but he seemed to be Asian with very spiky hair. He gave us his undivided attention regardless of how busy it was. He even topped off my McAllan drink without asking , which brought a smile to my face! The whole experience was just great! Highly recommend this place, worth your money and wait . "
1108,13-09-2017 ,5.0,This place is crazy busy most of the time. They were kind enough to offer to go options in case you don't want to wait. I tried the streak sandwich and potatoes bravas. Very very good. Then once someone left the bar I was able to take a seat and have more items! Glad I did. The fried fish! Yummmm! Lightly breaded and delicious. I enjoyed the visit here. 
1109,13-09-2017 ,4.0,"Very busy restaurant, not recommended for romantic dinners. Had my meal at the bar. Perhaps not the most attentive staff, but it was also very crowded. Above all else: nice meny, good quality food, excellent produce! "
1110,12-09-2017 ,5.0,"Our second time at Cerveceria Catalans, this time on a Sunday Lunchtime. Upon arrival we were greeted by queues on to the street, a sure sign of its popularity but not joyful if you arrive starving. No matter though, as putting your name down for a table is no problem, it also gives you the opportunity to marvel at the organised chaos that is going on all around you. Tables of 4 or more were being told the wait would be approximately 30mins and we were seated in 15. A word to the wise, listen carefully for your name being called, if you miss it there aren't any second chances and you have to approach the desk again. As for the food... it is simply fantastic, we enjoyed everything we tried (again) and couldn't fault a thing. "
1111,12-09-2017 ,5.0,"Chanced upon this restaurant whilst researching for other things. Having visited Casa Batlo, decided to try this out as it was nearby.As mentioned in reviews, this restaurant gets very busy and its not unusual to wait. It's also a good indicator of good restaurant when the waiting crowd and many diners were locals!The day we visited, there was a heavy downpour and we unfortunately were seated on the terrace. Although sheltered, still had some drips and drops on us but the service and the amazing food more than account for it.Had planned to return again but alas our plans didn't allow us to.Highly recommended for everyone around the neighbourhood or even not nearby to give this a try. Best food we had for the 6 days were here."
1112,11-09-2017 ,5.0,"Our hotel recommended this restaurant while we were looking for a place to eat after 11pm. There were about 30 minutes wait but we got seated in 15. Everything we tried was delicious: fried sardines, calamari, Greek salad, salmon on bread, tuna baguette and beef tenderloins. Definitely recommend for a nice tapas experience!"
1113,11-09-2017 ,3.0,As per reviews and recommendations it's supposed to be a very good restaurant. We had dinner at rush hour. Had to register in advance and told to come back in 40 min. Then had to wait an additional 30 min... A bad start. The food is not bad but not worth the Long wait. Desserts were great... Sangria nice. All in all I'm sure you can find other options and save yourselves the hassle. Prices are reasonable - we paid 85€ for 3. 
1114,11-09-2017 ,5.0,"At first I was worried to eat at a popular tourist restaurant however there's a food mix of both locals and tourist. The food is Amazing. This was hands down the best classic or authentic tapas I had in Barcelona. The beef tenderloin, shishito peppers, tomatoe bread and potatoe bravos was fabulous. Must try the dessert as well! And their lemon beer. "
1115,10-09-2017 ,5.0,"I had dinner with my friends,and we share lots of dishes. The restaurant is crowded but in a happy atmosphere. I love the desserts,yummy."
1116,10-09-2017 ,5.0,"For tapas and bier (who could ask for more at lunch after walking for hours!). Gambas, pulpo, conchas, fish, jamon bellota, pan con tomate, all the classics and more. Full of tourists but of local too. Be prepared to wait, specially if you are more than two. We dis not try the deserts (lack of space!) but what we saw looked delicious! Not a big assortment of wine by the glass (well, it is a cerveceria after all)!Menu in English and French is rather helpfull! "
1117,9-09-2017 ,5.0,I have visit this restaurant a few times and never get dissapoint. High quality spanish food. Not the cheapest but its worth it. Go early or be prepared to wait at least 30 min!! Its so good its always full. 
1118,9-09-2017 ,5.0,"I can't say enough good things about this place! Every food we ordered was great. The sangria was great too. Also very reasonable price wise, considering how much we ate & drank. Definitely recommend this place! "
1119,9-09-2017 ,5.0,"I went here 4 years ago and happy to report that last week it was as good as ever! Especially after being totally ripped off at Bar Mut, this place is wonderful and worth every penny."
1120,9-09-2017 ,5.0,"It was something of a shock to realise that I may have just visited one of my favourite restaurant/bars ever that I had to go back a second time to check it wasn't just the queso talking. It wasn't.Nor was it the salmon, the tuna, the myriad of salads or the good value vi negre (speak Catalan here, please) talking.It really is just very, very good.When religious people dream of the feasts available in heaven, this is the sort of display - and it is a display, with dish after dish on show on the counters - that they must be hankering after here on earth.When Charles Dickens described the lavishness of the meals indulged in by the Beagle in Oliver Twist before that awful bit with the sale of the orphan...Ok I'll stop. But you get the point.It's sophisticated but not snobby, top-notch quality but not expensive. Forward not back, etc. Go here. "
1121,8-09-2017 ,5.0,"Went here for breakfast and lunch. Clean, friendly, busy and often a queue. Great food and a lot of local/business clientele who obviously know a good thing when they see it."
1122,8-09-2017 ,5.0,"The restaurant was a recommendation from our apartment hotel Up Suites. It's a short walk to the restaurant from the apartment. The tapas were great. The Razor Calm and Grilled Squid are a must try. When in Barcelona, have to visit the restaurant. Thank you for a great and memorable dinner."
1123,7-09-2017 ,5.0,"This was a great/authentic tapas restaurant. There was a wait (30-45min) but the food and wine was delicious (worth the wait) great Tapas, seafood, wine,etc"
1124,7-09-2017 ,4.0,A bit expensive but super good dishes. In my city there are not those kind of tapas but the bear is cheap you can drink enough
1125,7-09-2017 ,5.0,"Recommended by our hotel staff, neighborhood restaurant and SO good! Every dish was superb! Just RUN there and eat happily!!"
1126,6-09-2017 ,2.0,"The food was excellent and so the service over all, yet there are way to many sellers, especially flower sellers that are left in the restaurant bothering patrons. Some are aggressive if you do not buy a flower. The manager should not let them in, especially considering they have security at the entrance. Additionally, there have been cases of picket pocket of people standing in line to get a table"
1127,6-09-2017 ,5.0,"Yum yum yum! Absolutely delicious!!!!! A must if your in Barcelona. Went with a big group and just ate and ate and ate. Started with cheeses and breads and and the sticky chips with an egg on top and finished with prawn and calamari skewers, mini burgers, cuttlefish, clams and the most amazing was the beef with liver on top... ahh absolutely amazing!!! We just let the waiter pick dishes and went with it. It was the best night. "
1128,6-09-2017 ,5.0,"Apartment I was staying in was one block up from this restaurant so passed it every night, and i tell you without fail no matter what time of day this place was packed... people waiting outside to get in was crazy! Completely understood why when we went one night to eat here. Tapas here is amazing. Best dish was definetely the garlic prawns WOW!!! Tip- you should go in put your name down and they will tell you to come back however many minutes down the line, means you can go around the corner and have a drink somewhere. This place is great value for money too... we were a party of 4 ate so much here and drank the night away and was so cheap!!"
1129,5-09-2017 ,4.0,"We went here on recommendations of a friend who lived here. A bit more expensive but the food it top quality. The place was packed but only had to wait 5-10 minutes.. Food came relatively fast, nice help from the waiter in our choices.Only downside is that the cheese y jamon krokets where on the dry side, and the patatas bravas could have been a bit warmer... We would still return here for sure. Definitely a go to place for authentic tapas. "
1130,5-09-2017 ,5.0,A friend had recommended to visit this restaurant for Tappas. I went on my first day and had the crab and avo stack - AMAZING! Lovely tapas and great variety! 
1131,5-09-2017 ,2.0,"Lively and crowded place with extremely average food, and mostly grouchy service. Not worth the wait and time -- go someplace else. We got there around 8.30pm, put our names on the waiting list and got a table at around 9.15pm. Which wasn't too bad.From there, the experience was completely sub-par. One of the waiters Teng was so surly, unsmiling, stern and impatient with almost everyone which definitely marred the experience. In terms of the food, it was actually the least delicious of all the food I've eaten in 2 weeks in Spain. The food was so average, I'm not sure why people rave about it. I'll say, skip this place and go to other big outlets such as El Nacional or small local eateries such as Santaugustina for way better food. The only bright side was our server Bilal who was quite cheerful and jovial in his interactions which made the experience slightly more enjoyable in a sea of grouchy impersonal service and subpar food."
1132,5-09-2017 ,5.0,"The first time we tried to eat at this restaurant, we went at 10 pm and were told there was a 1 and-a-half hour wait, so we ended up going elsewhere. But the restaurant was highly recommended by several friends who had visited Barcelona, so we returned the next night at 8 pm, and only had to wait 1/2 hr for our outside table. We ordered several tapas, as well as squid rings, (we had our 9 year old daughter with us, and that's what she wanted...) and a pitcher of cava. The food was delicious, and the cava was superb! I wish we had found this restaurant sooner, because I would have loved to try more of their wonderful food, but alas, we ate there on the last night of our trip. It was definitely the best dinner we had in Barcelona. The wait staff was courteous, attentive, and didn't rush us, even though there was a very long line of people waiting for tables. I highly recommend this restaurant."
1133,4-09-2017 ,3.0,"This place is definitely overrated. Super crowded, you have to wait in line if you want to get a table, they just bring your food one after the other and they all get cold. Its like they just serve you in a way that is so fast so you just eat eat eat and you get out. There are bunch of better places like vinitus and la faluta that are a hundred times better in terms of food, management and design. And they are cheaper! "
1134,3-09-2017 ,4.0,"We had another place in mind for lunch, but we ended up missing the lunch period, so were suddenly in search of a place open all day. Cerveceria Catalana to the rescue!This is a very lively restaurant. When we arrived (4pm) we noticed many groups of family/friends dining. After a few minutes wait in a crowded entrance, a table came available for us.We ordered cava (""white"") sangria and an assortment of small plates for the table: ""California"" and ""Greek"" salads, grilled asparagus and mushrooms, patatas bravas, tortilla espagnola, and nut-crusted camembert with a raspberry sauce.Sangria was great - refreshing. Salads and vegetables were super fresh. The patatas bravas were good, but tortilla was too ""eggy"" for our liking. The camembert was outstanding.A nice spot to gather with others. Great atmosphere and food."
1135,3-09-2017 ,5.0,"The tapas are great and the sangria is even better. There was a long line to get in almost 2 hr wait but it was worth it. The tapas are good, a little expensive but its nice, definitely worth going to if you have the time."
1136,3-09-2017 ,4.0,"My husband and I went without a reservation on a Tuesday in august at around 9:30. Waiting time was approximately 60 minutes. I was expecting this so we got into the waiting list and sat at the bar for drinks. While we were at it also ordered a few tapas. They were super yummy. We had the jamón Ibérico, pan con tomate, boquerones en vinagre, chicken and ham croquettes, montadito de cuatro quesos and gambas bruschetta. We paid 47 EUR. This place has indoor and outdoor seating.The staff was very friendly even with that much people at the restaurant. "
1137,3-09-2017 ,3.0,"After so much hype from friends we finally went to Cerveceria Catalana. We expected a wait. We went early in the evening and were seated within 20 minutes. The atmosphere is nice and added to my expectations. The service levels were good. The waitstaff, while very busy, were attentive and it was fairly easy to get someone's attention when needed. There is no idle time/pausing to chat with customers for the waitstaff.The menu offers a variety of standard dishes and tapas plus a daily tapas menu. There were four of us and we sampled several items. With one exception (beef tenderloin) the quality, taste and flavors were average. There was nothing special about the food; no love in the cooking or presentation. The sangria was also average: watery, little flavor.The food is average, and you pay average prices in a crowded, loud bar setting. Outdoor seating is available. Be prepared to queue, and enjoy a drink while you wait.There are many restaurants of better quality in Barcelona, and I would try another place before returning here again."
1138,2-09-2017 ,3.0,"We got here because everyone highly praised this chique place. The food was good, indeed, but due to the overcrowded atmosphere and cuddling with your seat neighbour, the overall sentiment is not really positive. The waitresses and waiters are very nice though and try to give the mass processing a personal touch."
1139,1-09-2017 ,5.0,"We got lucky as the 20 min wait turned out to be 2 min. Found the place by coincidence and loved it. Nice Cava Sangria and mix of food. Most came quick and way yum, the mini burgers however too too long to come. Given we were pretty full by that time it didnt matter much."
1140,1-09-2017 ,3.0,"Cervecería Catalana is definetly a tourist trap. It serves decent food but the waiting is not worth the outcome. I was probably the only local there and was the whole time talked to in English even though I replied the whole time in Spanish. I really do not understand why people wait in a line to eat there. No real tradition behind the restaurant, average food( actually, the squid ordered by my mom was very chewy) and okay service, quick but really impersonal. "
1141,1-09-2017 ,5.0,"This was my second visit. The first was with a group of friends last year and this time with my husband. On both occasions, the service, quality of food and atmosphere were fantastic. Yes, you have to queue, but if you go along with this in mind and are happy to have a drink and engage in conversation with other customers at the bar, then you won't be disappointed. The lady at the front desk was honest about wait times and was prompt in letting you know when your table was ready. The waiting service was good and most importantly the selection and quality of our tapas was fantastic. It wasn't too expensive and we came away feeling full and happy. A lively and buzzy tapas restaurant - definitely worth the wait. Highly recommended."
1142,31-08-2017 ,3.0,"Although the restaurant is spacious, it always has a long line so get there early, put your name in, and prepare to wait 30 mins to an hour for a table. After spending 10 days in Spain, I was not impressed at all with the food considering the wait - it was good, but not any better than the many other tapas restaurants around Barcelona. My recommendation would be to skip the line and head to another restaurant."
1143,31-08-2017 ,4.0,Fantastic tapas - lots of variety and all delicious! Get there earlier as there was a massive queue on a Friday night. We put our names down went shopping and came back in 45mins! 
1144,31-08-2017 ,1.0,"First, you have to hunt and fight for a place. To do that, you have to deal with the very rude lady at the front desk. We had to wait for an hour the receive a seat. We were starving but we waited because it was highly recommended by a local. When finally seated, it was hard to order as nobody really speaks English so we couldn't get information on the plates in the menu. Then, we couldn't eat half of the food that came as it was very badly cooked. Other too salty, almost raw prawns and other undercooked plates. The sangria was also very lame. On the hygene side... They are carrying garbage bags among the tables while you eat. And carts with bags and cases with food supplies :). A mix of pretended elegance and slop chute.And all this for a very high price."
1145,31-08-2017 ,5.0,"Awesome tapas and good service. I came once at night and it was packed, we squeezed up to the bar and got a bunch of tapas and drinks and had a great time. Came back a few days later for lunch, much quieter, sat outside. Ate a leisurely lunch and enjoyed it even more the second time! Definitely get the cheese on a stick with the nuts and fruit sauce. Soooo good. Will go back when I'm in Barcelona again!"
1146,30-08-2017 ,1.0,"During my business trip, I visited this famous tapas bar based on good reviews. What a disappointment! I feel you should avoid this place with rude and unfriendly staff particularly if you are Asians.Let me explain. From the very beginning, I felt something just not right. Because I avoided a peak time, the place was not so crowded when I visited. But I was ignored by several staff. Finally, a Chinese speaking Asian staff showed me to a table and another Asian staff took my order. They were nice. I had an impression that only Asian staff serves Asian table.A large waiter who acted like a manager was especially rude. He behaved as if I didn't exist. When he took a chair from my table so that a waiting customer could sit, He didn't say anything and kept avoiding eye contact. Even I payed my bill, he avoided eye contact and finally said thank you as if he hated it. It was the worst customer service I have ever had. Food was OK but not exceptional.In conclusion, I recommend your avoiding this place. There are numerous restaurants you can eat better food with far better service in this beautiful Barcelona. Don't be fooled by good reviews and stain your trip!"
1147,29-08-2017 ,5.0,"What a fantastic find, this was recommended by a local and didn't disappoint. Be aware there could be a wait as it's very popular with the locals. We let our waiter recommend the restaurants signiture dishes, honestly they weren't what we would normally order but we're more than pleased with his recommendations. Lovely atmosphere, reasonably priced and good wine selection. Can't wait for a return visit. Highly recommend."
1148,29-08-2017 ,4.0,"A wide selection of tapas. Most of it was excellent, one fish was OK. The service was fast - even on a busy day. A welcome break in the middle of the major tourist shopping area."
1149,29-08-2017 ,5.0,"We pay 2 visits each time we come to BarcelonaAlways excellent, outstanding !Dishes change each DayBest sit at the bar at the left when you enter"
1150,29-08-2017 ,4.0,good quality food for very little IMO. nice variation in the tapas selection and not touristy at all! 
1151,28-08-2017 ,5.0,"Since my first time in Barcelona, we always come back to CC. It is aways full of people. Great ambiance. The place you want to go to eat and share a variety of tapas with friends or family and have fun. Best Huevos cabriados. If you are hungry is perfect. If you are no so hungry is perfect too. Just a little patience when you are waiting and then Enjoy."
1152,28-08-2017 ,4.0,Our hotel recommended this restaurant and we enjoyed it thoroughly. We ordered several rounds of Tapas. The waiter was pretty good - perhaps not as overly attentive or friendly as we would have liked but still helpful with suggestions. The food was quite good and we were able to taste a wide variety of interesting Tapas. It is a decent sized restaurant and located in an upscale neighborhood. We would definitely go back!
1153,27-08-2017 ,5.0,"We waited for 40 minutes but it is worthed to wait. Beside what is written in here for advice, you should try mini burgers as well. "
1154,25-08-2017 ,5.0,"The only problem with this restaurant is that you have to wait for about half an hour - hour to get in because it's not possible to make a reservation. The mini burger is amazing, a must! Generally, everything was amazing except of the shrimps. Also the wine and desserts. Not expensive for what you get. With wine, desserts and all the food we got to around 35 € each.Best restaurant in Barcelona."
1155,24-08-2017 ,2.0,"Went here Cause it was close to our hotel, and because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. Was a bit disappointed. The waitress seemed strict and we only got two menus despite being three people. The food was very fat and didn't taste much. We even found a hair in the potatoes bravas. The waiter was very sorry and we got to choose something else. Would not go back"
1156,23-08-2017 ,5.0,"This place is rocking. We walked in for lunch and we're immensely lucky to immediately get seats at the bar. We had several tapas and they were all amazingly good: the cold ones were salmon, herring and cheese and the hot ones were gamba in aioli as well as a pasta salad and some cuddle fish and squid. We also were there late enough that we could try the paella: tasty! Best was the dessert: the St. Teresa bread pudding. We came by again at night to have a nightcap and dessert and it was packed with a line at 11:30pm. Clearly the place to be! "
1157,23-08-2017 ,5.0,Probably the best value for money restaurant I've ever been to. Food was amazing and service was equally as good. Have recommended to others and they've come back and said exactly the same. 
1158,23-08-2017 ,5.0,"Fun place for small plates. Great food to share. Freshest ingredients; well prepared dishes. Waitstaff was exceptional! You may have to wait a while for a table but it's worth it. Let your waiter choose the dishes if you are unsure they will not disappoint you. If you are lucky ask for Jordy and Alantony a great team! I'm not usually a Sangria fan but here it was very good, not too sweet.Shoestring potatoes with garlic aioli and fried egg was memorable!They didn't rush us, just the right amount of food and a lot of fun!"
1159,23-08-2017 ,5.0,"Suggested by local and visited 4 times during my 5-day stay in Barcelona, the best tapas in town, staff were friendly, may need to wait for 20min when busy."
1160,23-08-2017 ,5.0,"My son and I arrived early for dinner (at least by Spanish standards) and there was still an hour wait. Cerveceria Catalana, located just of Passeig de Gracia may be one of the worst kept secrets in Barcelona. I am sooo glad we waited as the food was outstanding and great value. It's small plates; I have beef, shrimp and lots of other great dishes. I would go again and again and again!"
1161,23-08-2017 ,5.0,"Hands down one of the best places I've been to. Been here twice on two separate trips. Tapas heaven. The egg noodle thing is O in the mouth. If you can follow my lingo. So good.It's always packed inside, wait is about 30-60mins. Totally worth it. Late dine and wine. "
1162,23-08-2017 ,4.0,"We ate here three times because of the very high quality of the tapas but always came early, before 13:00 for lunch and before 18:00 for evening meal. After that, the line rapidly gets out of control. Excellent tortilla, croquettes, seafood, especially pulpo etc. Too many kids and families for a quiet meal and the servers are rushing around like dervishes to keep up. Well worth a visit, but do not expect calm!"
1163,23-08-2017 ,5.0,"Awesome choice -- excellent selection, quality, and service. Crowded, but they can handle it, and did an excellent job, quickly. Go go go!"
1164,21-08-2017 ,5.0,"While we were checking into our hotel, another couple highly recommended this restaurant to us. That evening we decided to venture there. Arriving at the restaurant, we could see a huge lineup down the street. We arrived around 8:30 in the evening and were told it was approximately a 2 hour wait at this time. Since it was our last night, we decided to put our name on the list, go to a patio bar around the corner and have a drink or 2 and then come back. We were happy that we waited and really enjoyed our meal. We ended up going with recommendations from the staff and really enjoyed the Spanish potatoes, (almost like a version of poutine), the beef/foie gras dish, garlic shrimp and my favourite the eggplant, red peppers and goat cheese. Want to perfect this one at home. Staff is amazing—I don’t know how they work in this environment."
1165,21-08-2017 ,5.0,"We found this restaurant in the DK Top 10 Guide and were not disappointed. We arrived with three children (aged 7 - 12) and enjoyed a fantastic Tapas lunch en famille. The croquettas. the tortilla and the mussels were a great hit, but the mopst amazing dish was the chips with fried egg, tomatoes and garlic mayo! We ordered these as recommended by the waiter and were not disappointed. We have since tried these elsewhere in the city, but they are not a patch on the dish from the Cerveceria Catalana. Great wine too.All in all a perfect place for lunch - busy but excellent food and service. Well worth a visit."
1166,21-08-2017 ,5.0,"Have lived in BCN for almost 5 years and this place is always full of people, not surprised at all about that because of its authentic and scrumptious tapas. Nice atmosphere and good wine too. The only ""shortcoming"" is you always have to wait 20-50 min to get a table, especially during peak tourist season."
1167,21-08-2017 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was recommended by a Travel Variety Show in Taiwan. My friend and I decided to go for dinner on the 19 August. We arrived there near 9pm and was told that the waiting time is around 90 minutes to 2 hour. We gave it a missed and return the next day around 2pm. The waiting time this round was 30 minutes however we were offered seats at the bar in less than 5 minutes. We realised later that we can actually hang around the bar area to wait for seats if we do not need to have a table.This turned out to be an advantage to us as although the menu is in english, we still do not understand the dishes. Sitting at the bar allowed us to look at the food that was being served, and we can just let the server know by pointing at what we want, which is a much easier choice for us.They have a wide selection of tapas and we had mussels, octopus, scallops, prawn, mushroom and aparagus, crocrette and also for the first time we tried sangria. The food were good and the server was awesome. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Cerveceria Catalana."
1168,20-08-2017 ,4.0,"We had dinner here on our past night in Barcelona. We arrived at about 6pm which must have been at the right time as we did not have to wait for a table. The variety and quality of tapas here was second to none, though the prices were a little higher than other places. The only negative was that the pace was too fast for us. When we go for a quality tapas meal, we expected to be paced better. The food generally came out within minutes of ordering it so do not order more than 2 dishes at a time. Service otherwise was good as the servers were probably the most friendly in out experience in Barcelona."
1169,19-08-2017 ,4.0,We tried this place late afternoon when it was quiet. We had a couple of drinks and a couple of tapas which were excellent. We came back 8pm later that evening for dinner and had to wait almost one hour for a table. This place was heaving!! Many many people waiting for a table. But it was worth the wait. The food is very good and pretty reasonable compared to many restaurants in Barcelona. Many locals eat there and many tourist. Worth a visit.
1170,19-08-2017 ,5.0,Cerveseria Catalina is most definitely worth the wait. The food and the service is fantastic. The solomillo with foie gras and the tuna are a must.
1171,19-08-2017 ,4.0,Great ambiance and nice authentic food. Friendly and helpful staff - great experience - miss it already 
1172,19-08-2017 ,5.0,First time in a proper tapas bar and what a nice chilled place it is! Has beef tenderloin with foie gras and chicken and ham croquet! Tasted lovely!
1173,18-08-2017 ,5.0,"Oh my! What a great tapas restaurant. There is a lot of variety on the menu, but our favorites are: hamburgers (sliders) with caramelized onions and cheese, huevos Cabreaos (tiny fries with tomato sauce and eggs) and the dessert roscon borrachin (sponge cake with a little bit of creme brulee on top)."
1174,17-08-2017 ,2.0,We have waited more than one hour to have our table..We use to go there very often because I have family in Barcelona..The food wasn't so good..This restaurant is same owner than Ciudad Condal..
1175,17-08-2017 ,5.0,"Spent 2 nights in Barcelona, on both nights went to Cerveceria for dinner! It is SUPERB, trust me. First time there we had to wait, but we hung out in the bar before getting a table (took around 40 mins, not too bad).Our server was Alanthony, THE VERY BEST. He was so nice to us (one of the reasons we went back there), he treated us very well and helped us a lot with the menu!My friend's favorite was the pimientos padron (or something like that) and mine was the potato chips with egg and jamon (don't know what it's called). Not to mention the sangria, we had at least 2,5L per night lol.It is worth it to go with a friend and order many many tapas and just share, so you get a taste of everything. The only things we didn't like was the foie gras and the cod croquette. Also, don't forget the dessert! Get as many as you can!!"
1176,16-08-2017 ,5.0,Very good!!Amongst the (way too) many tourist traps around this area this was a great authentic experience. Deserts are a great highlight. Must leave room for them!!
1177,16-08-2017 ,4.0,"We arrived the restaurant at around 3pm and there were so many people waiting. So make sure you don't go there if you are too hungry :p Food was good and quick! Service was great , staff was attentive! Price was reasonably too. "
1178,15-08-2017 ,5.0,Excellent tapas with very friendly staff and reasonable prices. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
1179,15-08-2017 ,2.0,"This was suggested to us by our hotel as 'traditional' tapas. I think what he meant was traditional tapas dishes, so patatas bravas, padron peppers, iberico ham etc.First of all don't be fooled into thinking the hour and a half wait means the food will be fantastic as you will be disappointed. The reception area with hostess taking names for your table doesn't work it just means there are lots and lots of people there and I can't imagine it is very enjoyable for the people sat trying to eat at the bars either side.Then there is the food which is just okay. Very average tapas."
1180,14-08-2017 ,5.0,"This place was recommended to us by a local who said it was a sure good experience. Well indeed, the place is a hit. Rather large but still full. There was a 30 minute wait but definitely worth the wait. The tapas are of good quality and portion. Everything was fresh. Service was good. The huevos estrellados were exceptional because of the string fries which was a first for me. Try the little hot dog with bacon. The padrón peppers were awesome. Overall an excellent experience"
1181,14-08-2017 ,5.0,"Saw this recommended online so wanted to try it. We ate early (6:30pm) because we had a very early flight the next day -- as a result the line was short and we only waited 10 minutes for a table. The tomato bread and mixed tapas plate was a great starting point and then we ordered additional things we liked (garlic clams!). The waiter recommended the egg and chips so we tried that, also the bread pudding dessert -- both excellent. Atmosphere was bustling at that hour, lots of families with children. We had a tucked away table, so it was relatively calm and quiet where we were. A very enjoyable meal."
1182,13-08-2017 ,4.0,"A staple for our annual visit to Barcelona! We've been coming here every year and it's where we have our first lunch each time to remind us why we love Barca, and Catalan food! Superb Iberian ham, potato bravas and garlic shrimps. Great service and a favorite of locals. "
1183,13-08-2017 ,5.0,"This is my fourth time in this restaurant. Everytime I come it's always a great experience. Same his time. Fresh and great food, excellent atmosphere and helpful/friendly staff. We had enjoyed excellent tapas: mini burgers, beef terderloin, spanish omlette, etc.. all great. Recommend big time."
1184,13-08-2017 ,3.0,"The food is good, as always. The service on the other hand is terrible... the waiter was not helpful at all, murmuring in spanish... if they do not like tourists the best thing to do is change their occupation!"
1185,12-08-2017 ,5.0,Best food ever. I tried it today and i will return tomorrow. Delicious. Seafood was extremely fresh. You should wait at least 30mn to have a place but wait and you will not regret.
1186,11-08-2017 ,3.0,"After spending two weeks in Barcelona and surrounding cities I can truly say that this is an average place at best (I struggled with whether this was a 2 or 3 star ratings). Most of the patrons were tourists, and the food was just, 'OK'. There are a lot of really good places (some in more touristy areas than this) in Barcelona. The seafood seemed average, and none of the dishes really stood out -- with a party of 7 I tasted several dishes, so it wasn't just because we had some bad luck with a couple of tapas. The service was just fine. I'd recommend going elsewhere."
1187,11-08-2017 ,5.0,"We visited this ""little simpler"" restaurant spontaneously during a walk in the city and became very pleasantly surprised. The food was way above expectation, very good. The staff were friendly and we were very pleased! "
1188,10-08-2017 ,5.0,"Amazing Tapas experience which was well worth the one hour wait.The restaurant was so busy making a superb atmosphere in the process.The service was fantastic and the food was beautiful. I personally recommend the ""Cabreaos"" eggs style and the beef tenderloin both were out of this world.I must take this opportunity to thank Michelle, the young lady who was front of house. Despite having to put up with rude people who were unwilling to wait an hour, she smiled throughout and was very friendly. We enjoyed the experience so much that we actually went back the next night for Round 2.An absolute must for all of those tapas lovers heading to Barcelona. "
1189,10-08-2017 ,5.0,"Visited Barcelona for a romantic get away with my boyfriend. We wanted to try some traditional tapas and read about this restaurant on a blog. We waited 1 hour & 45 mins but it was completely worth it! So much so that we came back the next night (and only had to wait 45 mins)! Food was incredible and delicious! We had 5 dishes between us. Definitely recommend the 'huevos' egg dish - a combination of fries, eggs, and ketchup - tasted unbelievable! Beef tenderloin was particularly nice too, as well as the ham plate with bread and tomato! Waitresses, waiters and front of house were very friendly and welcoming. Prices were great too. Overall a fantastic experience - would recommend to everybody! "
1190,10-08-2017 ,5.0,Everything here is great! Worth the wait. You will not be disappointed in the tapas and prices are very reasonable. Service was also great. 
1191,10-08-2017 ,3.0,"To much tourist, we expect tradicional and was full for foreign nerds, and the food and service are good"
1192,9-08-2017 ,5.0,"Visited with our three teenage grandchildren....their first tapas experience. They (and we) loved it! The beef tenderloin, the prawns, the mixed plate...all delicious. The wait was 20 minutes, but well worth it. Would go back again. Enjoy!!"
1193,9-08-2017 ,4.0,"We've arrived there at 8pm. It was beginning of October, so just after tourist season ends. There were reservations but without them, we had to wait for a free table 30 minutes and we were signed in the notebook, so no couldn't get in front of us. Also, we have the time to walk around. The restaurant was fully occupied, crowded, but that just made the atmosphere of a local restaurant. The prices were around 20-30% higher than in other tapas bars which we visited. About dishes, well they were just great"
1194,9-08-2017 ,5.0,A hotspot that you definitely need to pay a visit when in Barcelona. Loved the tapas variety and uniqueness in taste!!!
1195,8-08-2017 ,5.0,Late night dinner in this fantastic place. They offered various types of tapas which were unique and delicious! Friendly staff too! The place is extremely crowded so we had to wait around 30-40mins to get seated. Found a spot in the bar and ordered the food directly. 
1196,8-08-2017 ,5.0,"As soon as you get close to this place you can tell is one of Barcelonas hottest spots. There is always a queue to get in and it's packed with locals and turista alike, for a perfect good reason, this place serves some of the best tapas in town! It is not over rated, I've never had anything but amazing tapas in here. I do believe is a bit of the expensive side but it's well worth it"
1197,8-08-2017 ,5.0,"If given a chance to visit Barcelona again, will definitely eat in this restaurant! Busy? Yes, but worth the waiting time. Everything we ordered was delicious, the sangria superb!But the most hit was the huevos cambreros! Burger was great too!"
1198,7-08-2017 ,4.0,During my recent trip in Barcelona i was brought here by a friend of mine and all her stories about this place didn't disappoint. Everything was delicious and you can choose different kind of tapas from their rich menu. Be expected to wait*. We were a large group of 7 people and we waited for about an hour. Will definitely be back here.
1199,5-08-2017 ,5.0,"This is our top pick whenever we visit Barcelona - on our latest weekend break there, we visited this restaurant on no less than three occasions. It was just as we remembered it from last time - amazing tapas (in particular, we loved the fried anchovies, the steak/foie gras dish, the mini hamburgers, and all of the pinxos which are on display). It's really busy, so has a great atmosphere - worth booking a table, though!"
1200,4-08-2017 ,5.0,"Perfect for eating traditional tapas at a good price. You do not feel that they have stolen you. They serve quality food and good portions. Perfect to go in family or with friends. They do not only have good food but also the have an extensive menu of beer. It is needed to say that the staff is very pleasant. The local has a modern air but it does not lose the essence of the tradition.I recommend to go in the evening for having dinner, share a nice time, enjoying. "
1201,4-08-2017 ,5.0,"This restaurant is great! It is very popular, so you may have to wait a few minutes, but it is worth the wait! The Sangria is the best I have ever tasted. The food is incredible as well. What I was really impressed with was that there was a woman who has Down Syndrome working as a waitress. This impressed me because I have not seen this in America yet in my travels. I have worked with people who have Down Syndrome and others who have special needs, so this really made me excited to see that this country has encouraged such a great work environment. All of the other staff were helping her and she was doing an awesome job waiting on tables and cleaning the tables for more customers. I suppose I shouldnt have been surprised and so impressed, I should hope and expect to see that more often, but sadly I do not. Overall, this restaurant was one of the best experiences on our honeymoon!(we were there November 2015, not September 2016, it just wasnt an option on the drop down menu)"
1202,2-08-2017 ,5.0,"Every time we come to Barcelona, this is the very first place we go to. Tapas are excellent, every single one of them, the staff is very professional and welcoming and the atmosphere is very nice and casual."
1203,2-08-2017 ,4.0,"So we arrived without a reservation but early enough to secure a table for two. Not a leisurely meal as the service was almost too efficient. However it was enjoyable the menu was not extensive but we chose the mixed tapas (which in hindsight we wouldn't do again) nothing wrong with it just not very adventurous on our part. Tasty food, nice wine, good service and reasonably priced. What's not to like. "
1204,2-08-2017 ,3.0,"The tapas are not top-notch, and the list of specials is shorter and less original than it used to be. However, the food is still pretty decent, and it comes out fast. Prices are reasonable. Furthermore, it is open all day, so it's popular with all customer segments. It is either full at 'normal' hours with foreign customers, and at Spanish eating hours there is a long queue. Service staff are like the place - efficient even if lacking charm."
1205,2-08-2017 ,5.0,"This was my first stop in Barcelona on my Tapas indulging and I was not disappointed. I had heard this was THE spot to first try, which I was hesitant to wait for a meal on my first evening there. We went to place our names on the list, waited the 45 minutes then were seated. The restaurant only has one bottle of red to serve by the bottle but the value met its need. I enjoyed everything on the menu I could have, though the Creme Brulee brought a tear to my eye, was so savory that I ordered a second !! Please go and enjoy!"
1206,2-08-2017 ,5.0,"What else is there to add to the other reviews, this place is great, the food is fantastic and the service is quick but polite. Great for both lunch or dinner. One night we went pass the restaurant on our way home, it was a Tuesday night and the place was still buzzing at 11.30 at night....fantastic "
1207,2-08-2017 ,5.0,"This place is very popular and there is no question why it is. even on a monday night when we arrived at 8pm we had a 20 min wait (this is quite early in Spain for dinner!) Get there a little before you're hungry as its worth the wait. The sangria is very tasty, and lethal if you haven't eaten anything. The food comes out so quick and has a very extensive menu for a very reasonable price. we walked out very full without feeling our wallets had been emptied. Beef tenderloin and potatas bravas worth a mention."
1208,2-08-2017 ,5.0,"This place was immense. My wife and I loved the food. The restaurant has a busy vibe and a great atmosphere. We were recommended to go by a friend and it was that good we went back a second evening. A must visit.Please note it is very busy so when you arrive speak to the lovely ladies who are taking the bookings and they will tell you how long it will be until they can seat you. Both visits we were told an hour wait so we put our names down then left to enjoy a stroll nearby. We returned about 45 mins later and were seated right away. The staff were all very friendly and helped make suggestions when ordering as well. Lastly the price is very reasonable as well, my wife and I ate like royalty and still left with change.We will be back!"
1209,2-08-2017 ,5.0,"We were here early Sunday evening and everything about this place is just ... magically relaxing! You can see the raw materials for the tapas and order from the bar and sit outside on the street. The food was so fresh and tasty. We enjoyed the razor clams greatly and they were so fresh that they tasted sweet!! Another favorite is the wild mushrooms with a raw egg on top. And all the dishes are extremely inexpensive! We completely got relaxed after full day of walking, with some cool sangria and amazingly tasty and beautiful tapas! I must say the Spanish know how to enjoy life!"
1210,1-08-2017 ,4.0,"Another tapas place with great food. it all goes super fast and is super super busy and noisy so maybe better for groups, friends and family than a romantic dinner! "
1211,1-08-2017 ,4.0,We found this restaurant though a review on TripAdvisor. It is not far off the Avenue Diagonal and is quite large but with few outside tables. However the road is not much to be sat next to so we choose to eat indoors. Even at 1830 the restaurant was busy and although we did not have to wait for a table for 2 bigger parties were having to wait up to 10 minsService was very quick - they clearly like to get you through and out but you did not feel rushed to leave. Staff were attentive and quick. Food was good - we had tapas and enjoyed all the dishes we tried. Sangria was potent (more so than the others we had)Good meal and we were pleased with the restaurant. Suggest that it probably gets very busy later in the evening and don't think you can book so get there early or be prepared to wait
1212,1-08-2017 ,5.0,"We found this place on google maps when we were in the area and we luckily got a table for lunch, it was very crowded but it is a big place. The staff was welcoming and friendly and the food was delicious! We were happy to find salad! The patatas bravas, coquettes, octopus and some egg dish (I can't remember, but it's one of their main ones) were very good. You could also go and pick tapas from the bar that were on display. Great place!"
1213,31-07-2017 ,2.0,"I was just about to post this review with a 3 when my husband and I came down with serious upset stomach !!! Let me start with the positives! Clearly the place is buzzing and has a huge fan following. There were queues when we reached around 8.15 pm on a Monday and expected waiting time was 1.15 - 1.30 hrs. But that didn't deter the enthusiast! Plus if you aren't dying with hunger there is a lot to do around with many fashion brand stores on the road next door so an hour can easily be managed. The lady who was making the reservation, I think her name is Michele was really professional, polite and wonderful. Even though she would say and 1.30 hr the way she said it made it seem much lesser. We went back around 9.30 and were taken to our table after hanging around for 5-10 mins more. The server were helpful, we don't know Spanish and the lady who took our order, explained to us many dishes on the 'today's special menu' translating to English (very rapidly though) she was playful and sweet to my 4 yr old. We ordered many things as expected from a tapas! Mostly recommendation from the staff : garlic prawn, croquette, aubergine pepper and goat cheese, bravas, some fish, fired green peppers, asparagus and mushroom and sangria jug. The food in taste was ok, though the croquettes and asparagus mushroom was good. But please nothing to die for like some claim. The rest was pretty flavourless but it could be the cuisine itself , I'll hv to see after I try it at a few more places. After we finished, the total amount for all that food and drink was like 50 € which I would say was decent for the ambience of the place. The trouble started when we reached home, both my husband and me came down with upset stomach and I can tell u mine is pretty tough one. The only thing we ate all evening was the food here and an ice cream an hour before at 8 from Hagendaz. So I would say, totally avoidable. Or may it was our bad day. "
1214,31-07-2017 ,5.0,The Sangria was fantastic. The grilled prawns and Andalusian baby squids were unforgettable. There was a 45 min wait even though we arrived at 3pm. It was worth the wait though.
1215,30-07-2017 ,5.0,"Really lovely tapas - fast service - the obvious plus more interesting, like mushroom with asparagus, plus ""chips with eggs"" - gorgeous! We shared our tapas, however, when our desserts arrived - beautifully presented - it was heads down, no sharing - yummy!"
1216,30-07-2017 ,3.0,"We waited for 1 hour as we got high recommendations on it, it was nice while the service was like in a food factory.I think can find better.Some of the food was excellent and some average."
1217,29-07-2017 ,3.0,The place was very big and crowded. The food was just OK. The staff was terrible. The sangria was less than OK. Not worth the money. 
1218,29-07-2017 ,5.0,"I've visited 4 or 5 times over the last few years and always been impressed.If you're in Barcelona and want good tapas and wine - this is a really solid option.Not too expensive and great variety of dishes.Be prepared to show up and put your name down to wait for around 45 mins (i.e. plan ahead!), staff are always super helpful."
1219,29-07-2017 ,4.0,"The best tapas restaurant in Barcelona for each time and each wallet but beware of the queue! Good service, modern interior. "
1220,29-07-2017 ,5.0,"We were looking for authentic local tapas. Asked a local bartender for ideas and she recommended this place. Once we arrived could see how popular it was, we reserved a table and waited. Once in we ordered so much to choose from. Every dish that arrived was incredible, so tasty and full of flavours. If only our bellys weren't to full we would of eaten more. The best tapas we have ever had, topped off with a jug of champagne sangria. The service was outstanding. Would highly recommend, we would certainly visit again if in the area. "
1221,28-07-2017 ,4.0,"Family of six ate a very nice meal here. Have been here several times the last years and still amazed of high tapas quality vs. affordable price. Only drawback was long waiting for table (1h for 6 persons), so the tip is to be early if your're more than 4 persons. Recommended!"
1222,28-07-2017 ,3.0,Friendly and efficient staff.Fast food quality tapas when they try to sell an upscale concept...Food was definitely average but priced as upscale.You can get better taste and quality for less money.
1223,28-07-2017 ,5.0,"One of my favorite tapas restaurants in Barcelona. I try and snag a seat at the tapas bar so I can see what they offer and spy on other peoples dishes as they come out and try those too! But the dishes are very good across the board. Quick service. Can be hectic at the bar area as the place stays extremely busy, especially for lunch hours. Pretty large dining area as well. Good beers and sangria. Must try while in Passeig de Gracia area."
1224,27-07-2017 ,5.0,Really nice food! Very busy and many people! But the staff was really fast and efficient! The food and sangria was nice and very simple! I would definitely recommend it! 
1225,26-07-2017 ,5.0,"We enjoyed the tapas here very much. Again, the bravas were a hit, along with the potato with the egg mixed in. The sangria was better here. We waited 1.5 hours, arriving at 2:30. "
1226,25-07-2017 ,4.0,"When it comes to Catalan fare and mood nothing beats this place. Service is frantic, food shows in no time, all of it is genuine and most of it is good. Don't expect too much sympathy or empathy since catalans are very moody and grumpy about tourists "
1227,25-07-2017 ,3.0,Food is delicious but don't go too late with a little child. (We were told to wait around 45min) but it was so busy we waited more than 1 hour (not sure if some people cut off line but we do see people arriving later but got seated before us...)
1228,24-07-2017 ,4.0,"Visited this restaurant 2 times, the result was good both times.Very busy place, but to be honest with no particular reason.Has a nice sitting area, always full, nice bars where you can sit and enjoy your meal there, and like i mentioned above, it serves nice tapas, good variety, tasty but feels like is fast / mass produced but without stepping our of providing quality meals.If you are close its a good place to eat, but do not bother to travel in order to visit it.I am sure that you can find evenly good places to eat tapas in the neighbourhood you are staying."
1229,24-07-2017 ,5.0,Hands down the best sushi you will have in your entire life. Usually a very long cue to get a table but it is so worth it. Everything on the menu is delicious. Have been here on every Barcelona trip and would not miss to go here anytime I will go back.
1230,23-07-2017 ,4.0,Lovely lunch - lucky as we didn't have to wait to get a table! Fresh seafood and lovely dishes - asked for some recommendations from a local seated next to us :) recommend the tomato bread (pan con tomate) and fish!
1231,22-07-2017 ,5.0,A big selection of amazing traditional Spanish tapas and great atmosphere! The place gets very busy at times so be prepared for a short wait before you get seated. 
1232,21-07-2017 ,5.0,"I am not sure what I can add that has not already been said before. I will say, go for the fries with eggs. It was like the best breakfast hash browns with a spicy (not real strong) ketchup. We waited 40 min, told 40 min and 20, told 20 min. The hostess is spot on and knows what she is doing. Too bad we went there the 6th day in our 9 day stay in Barcelona or I would have gone 5 times instead of twice. "
1233,20-07-2017 ,3.0,"We came here with a group of friends and we found the servers to be a little pushy and very rushed (as in, you could barely tell them what you wanted before they got impatient and wanted to run off). For example, our server just suggested that we wanted a liter of sangria and took off... My boyfriend had to Flagg him down to explain that we did not want sangria. The food was very good and had a lot of flavour but was pretty pricy and the experience​/atmosphere was only so-so. "
1234,20-07-2017 ,5.0,"I would suggest you book a table as this is obviously a very popular restaurant. The queue was very long outside on a Wednesday evening and as we hadn't booked a table we decided to return a little earlier (6:30 pm) the following day. This time we were seated quickly and attended by a friendly waiter who was happy to suggest items from the menu upon our request. We chose the fillet steak on crisp bread, deep fried cod balls, pork and pepper sandwich + potatas bravas and everything tasted absolutely fantastic. The sevice was quick and friendly, and although the queue had started forming outside by the time we were finished, we were not rushed at all by the staff. We highly recommend this restaurant for tasty and authentic Spanish tapas. Will definitely visit again!"
1235,20-07-2017 ,5.0,"i loved this place, the food was very good, but we were lucky to get a place at the bar, but i saw some people waiting for long to get a table. it is worth it i guess!"
1236,19-07-2017 ,5.0,"Though the place is usually crowded, you can get a spot if you go early -around 19:30 is a good time. There is a great variety of tapas and I would specially recommend the gump brochette and the beef montadito. But, actually, almost everything you can eat is very nice."
1237,18-07-2017 ,5.0,"Went on hot summer evening. Had to wait a bit (YOU can't book) but we we went elsewhere for a quick drink. Once installed, friendly and efficient service (the waiter even advised us against ordering too much !!). The food was simply magic. The desserts are worth a visit too. You won't be disappointed. "
1238,18-07-2017 ,2.0,"The prawns were overdone and not freshly cooked. The steak was tough. The sangria was so sweet that I couldn't even get through a full glass so I left a full pitcher on the table. The Greek salad and croquettes were ok. The one redeeming feature of this very busy but very mediocre tapas bar were the very kind and very hardworking waiters. Unfortunately, still cannot recommend."
1239,18-07-2017 ,5.0,"Excellent restaurant that deserves Michellin stars! You have to arrive early because it's so full always, but you always get the opportunity to eat. Delicious tapas, delicious mini hamburgers, delicious mini lamb!! And spectacular Spanish tortilla! Excellent attention too! In the 9 days in Barcelona we went three times!"
1240,18-07-2017 ,4.0,Lots of people and really busy when se where here. Decent wine list and good food. Although got a feeling of foodchain rather than good restaurant. 
1241,17-07-2017 ,5.0,This place has the best tapas we have ever had. We stayed in Barcelona for 7 days and after eating there went back another 2 times cos it's really that good. Tips:- it's busy... all the time. So go late. I mean after 10pm. Don't worry your in Barca so everything is open late. - there is always a long wait for a table so ignore the crowds and press on through to the desk just inside the door. Put your name down then STAY and mill around the bars and try to get a seat there. The menu is exactly the same and you'll end up getting better service. - Rusty works at the bar on the left (facing in) and is a legend. Fast service and some great suggestions
1242,17-07-2017 ,5.0,*Best things we tried there was the fries with the egg (I believe it's their most popular dish) get it!! It's so goodThe patatas bravas is okay. The aioli that is on it is kind of too strong in my opinion.The server helped us choose other tapas because most of the tapas that were not on the actual menu were all in Spanish. They were okay. *The beef tenderloin and hamburger are delicious as well (only gives you one piece) *My favorite dessert we ordered was the bread pudding. *drools
1243,16-07-2017 ,4.0,"Crazy crowds even at 1030pm (they close at 130am)- Good value for $$- tried their prawn skewers, beef, eggs, calamari, croquettes, anchovies- for all 10 dishes or so & 0.5l of sangria it came up to 64euros which left us full & satisfiedDefinitely recommended to anyone making a trip to Barcelona!"
1244,16-07-2017 ,4.0,"Went for dessert crema catalan and was packed so got a takeaway. Wanted to see what the fuss was about so went for breakfast the next day... brilliant food and lovely service. No reservations ever so go early for no wait or be prepared to wait. Had the crazy eggs (must have), and the mini hamburger, smoked salmon montaditos. Super fresh good quality and very reasonable. "
1245,15-07-2017 ,5.0,"We wanted to try Catalana after seeing reviews on Google. Our first attempt to try it out was Saturday night at 10pm; it was way too busy that we knew we'd be waiting a long time, so we decided to skip it. Sunday morning, we went back to Catalana around 11:30am and were seated right away at a table inside. There plenty of options on the menu, as well as a daily special menu that's only printed in Spanish. Have the server translate the specials for you because there are tons of great options on there. We tried the iberico ham, fried cuttlefish, croquette, beef tenderloin on bread, and sangria, and everything was so delicious. Save room for dessert because they have these wonderful little desserts for about 2-3 euros that are rich and decadent. We loved the food so much that we went back for lunch another day, trying some other items from the menu. If you're looking for authentic tapas in a nice atmosphere, visit Catalana. Skip the wait by going for lunch."
1246,15-07-2017 ,3.0,We went here after we saw all reviews and after 2 hours queue to get a table we expected something incredible. In the end it's an average place which you can find elsewhere in Barcelona without having to wait that much..
1247,15-07-2017 ,5.0,"A former colleague said we couldn't miss this place, and how right he was! A bit off the regular tourist route, but packed with people, so we knew it had to be good. The options were varied and delicious. Prices very reasonable. We enjoyed it so much, we went back a second time, at 10:30, pm, and still found a (shorter) wait."
1248,15-07-2017 ,4.0,"As much as I love this place the wait for a table is ridiculous. I got there at 7pm thinking it was early as most locals don't have dinner till late. Waited over 1 hour for a table. I was ushered inside at about 8:30pm, ordered the food and drinks quickly all of the staff speak English. Make sure to keep checking the waiting list as sometimes if they call out your name and you didn't hear it you'd be crossed of the list. I love the food I go to this place every time I'm in Barcelona it's a shame about the wait though. This place is also usually full during lunch time as well. "
1249,14-07-2017 ,5.0,"My dad and I decided to come here for dinner after this place was recommended to us. It did not disappoint. The wait was long (40 minutes), but you don't have to stand in line. We ended up exploring the surrounding area for a while, and we found a few interesting things. We came back and by that point we were the first name on the list. The restaurant is large and has plenty of tables both outside and in. You can get your name on both lists if you want. Once you are inside, the servers are very nice and attentive. They speak both English and Castellano. You can order as many tapas if you want; if you're not full you can always get more. They are very quick to come out after ordering, so you can have a quick meal if you want. Overall, this restaurant is a nice place to get authentic and enjoyable tapas if you're willing to wait for a while.I strongly recommend you arrive about 45 minutes before you actually want to eat."
1250,14-07-2017 ,4.0,"45 minute wait for a table, bedlam out front but the maitre d' did a good job at herding the masses. Great tapas, excellent cava sangria. Recommendations - bacon and roqueforte sandwich, the hotdog with caramelised onions and the anchovies. Bueno. "
1251,14-07-2017 ,5.0,"Nice place with good service and good variety of tapas. The food was very good. In the evening you probably need to wait some time for the table, but it is worth it."
1252,13-07-2017 ,5.0,"On our last full day of being in Barcelona, we wanted to get more tapas so we stumbled across this place. I believe we arrived around 5pm in the late afternoon and didn't think there would be much of a wait but we were slightly wrong. Fortunately, we were seated in less than 10 minutes. When we were handed the menus, my friend and I were having deja vu because it looked SO similar to the previous tapas bar we went to the other day, Ciudad Condal. Found out it is the sister or counterpart restaurant! I guess we should have done more research on our part but we made it all the way here so we decided to stay and eat regardless.Tried our best to order different items this time around to avoid having the exact experience. We wanted more iberico so ordered a plate where we got to try different types. Very delicious, with my favorite being the chorizo-type of iberico I believe. We also ordered the fries with egg: now THAT was my absolute favorite tapas. There is just something about eggs and potatoes that I love so dearly. In summary: highlights of our meal includes the fries with egg (cabreaos egg style), beef tenderloin flauta, and cripsy Camembert (fried cheese similar to Brie with fruit jam spread on top). Everything we got was good though but those aforementioned were my favorite.Dessert was also delicious! I got something like a fried donut with cream inside and chocolate you can pour over it (""xuzo"" or ""zuxo""? Forgive me, I may have it totally wrong). It was so simple yet the perfect ending to my meal. If you're unable to go to Ciudad Condal, this is another place you can try to have essentially the same experience. Waitstaff was extremely friendly and attentive as well, brought out food and cleared our plates quickly. They stopped by to chat with us as well, which was nice and added to our time there. We spent a good 1.5 hours there and enjoyed it just as much as Ciudad Condal. I recommend coming here and getting to try good tapas!"
1253,13-07-2017 ,5.0,"It's on the 3 day guide but we were in the Regia perfumeria and salesman recommended it also. OMG!!! Great tapas!!! I have 3 daughters and each loved what they had. Upscale look but affordable prices. We had grilled cuttlefish, baby squid, squid malagueña style, manchego plate, great sandwiches: mallorca, sausage and cheese, bacon and cheese, grilled pork loin with cheese, and bravas. All were excellent. Great service and everyone spoke great or passing English. Must do if you are near avenue Diagonal region (few blocks off Red and green lines of hop on/hop off bus). "
1254,13-07-2017 ,4.0,"Great place with good variety of tapas. The sangria was tasty on a hot day. The wait was long for an outside table but worth it. Beef tenderloin was my favorite tapa, so tender and cooked perfect! Be sure to have dessert too. "
1255,11-07-2017 ,4.0,"There are some iconic restaurants in Barcelona, and this is one of them. Cervecería Cataluña and its sister restaurant Ciudad Condal are unashamedly tourist traps, with a twist... the food is very good and not a complete rip-off. Sure, you can find cheaper alternatives, or more ""authentic"" alternatives, but this restaurant truly delivers a tasty, quality tapas menu with blazing fast service (yes, they are trying to rush you... be warned, there is almost always a wait). Stick to traditional tapa menu items and avoid more intricate plates. This place is ideal for couples and groups of friends. Families will need to wait for a proper table in order to enjoy."
1256,11-07-2017 ,4.0,Great restaurant. The food is great and the desserts are amazing. It often packed and for a good reason.
1257,11-07-2017 ,5.0,We sat at the Tapas bar for lunch and enjoyed a variety of Tapas. The service was great and we spoke to very nice locals who gave us great recommendations on dinner spots. Recommend you wait for a seat at the bar. There was a separate bar for seafood that looked very good. 
1258,10-07-2017 ,5.0,"No reservations so you need to get there early, get on a list and then wait amongst the melee of other people waiting. Our wait was only around 30 mins and I was glad to see the restaurants has far more tables than when I went there a while back so turnaround is very quick. Bizarrely you can order and eat tapas whilst waiting from the same menu so the only value of waiting is to have a slightly more civilised seated experience!Tapas excellent though and very attentive staff - good price"
1259,10-07-2017 ,4.0,"Popular and for a good reason! We went here twice during our trip (once for lunch, once for dinner). Definitely know there will be a line, but very friendly service and really good with kids. Will walk through the menu and recommend different things. Sangria was excellent, as were the croquettes."
1260,9-07-2017 ,2.0,"We went there around 11:00 pm for a drink, after having great tapas and drinks at Ciudad Condal. It looks like a nice place, with good food and drinks, but some staff were not so welcoming. We finally got to order some drinks, and they were cheap, but we had to drink them on a corner close to the garbage, the host didn't allow us to go to an empty part of the bar, because we were not ordering food."
1261,9-07-2017 ,4.0,"Ok so the place sells an excellent Tinto de Verano and the food is crazy. It is crowded and the reason why is not a 5 it's because the staff is a bit rude, they just won't pay attention and doesn't matter what language you speak Spanish or some other one.Overall I think its good place to spend an afternoon and then just head to the Gaudi's houses or the beach. I would recommend it. "
1262,9-07-2017 ,5.0,"TOP TIP - put your name in the list. This place is always packed, you will no doubt have to wait at least half an hour for a table, so make sure you put your name down in advance. This place is widely recommended. There is a large range of dishes to choose from, all of which are amazing! The price is very good too. We went twice and ate plenty for ~15€ each. All the food is fresh and tasty, our favourite dishes were the beef tenderloin with pepper, the cod (literally amaxing) and the mini sandwiches - particularly pork and pepper. Would happily go back again and again! "
1263,9-07-2017 ,5.0,"Great selection, but gets real busy so go between 6-7 after that there is usually a wait. All the selections were fresh and tasty. French Fies with eggs very good"
1264,8-07-2017 ,5.0,"Back again every day for 4 days why experiment whether you have breakfast/lunch/dinner in the bar/restaurant/terrace you can not loose.Brilliant tapa/food and service, not expensive the only catch u will have to queue any thing from 15 minutes to 2 hours but u can do that with a drink in your hand.Recommended D"
1265,8-07-2017 ,5.0,"Recommended by friends who met us there around 12;30 for lunch. (Any later, it would have been full. The menu is extensive with daily specials. all dishes were excellent and the wine is inexpensive as well. Highly recommended."
1266,7-07-2017 ,5.0,"I was recommended to visit this place and showed up about half past eight in the evening. There was a huge line and the place was busy, but since I was alone I was asked to wait for a seat at the bar. I quickly got a seat. The food was very delicious and the service was very good. I will come back next time I visit Barcelona."
1267,7-07-2017 ,4.0,"We didn't have any reservation when arrived and was told that there was a waiting list for about 30-45 minutes which we would understand from the huge line from other diners who were also waiting ( reminder that we went on a Thursday evening ), so we opted to sit at the bar instead which actually turned out to be even better!All the tapas that we tried was amazing, especially the foie gras which was just to die for! It melted in my mouth and I could not have just only one. The house wine served was also great and the atmosphere was fun and lively.Highly recommend the place and highly recommend to sit at the bar if you're not in a big group as I found it more fun and interactive with other diners, chefs and staffs :)"
1268,4-07-2017 ,4.0,"I was told that you couldn't make a booking at this restaurant and was advised to get there early. We arrived at 6.30pm but we had a 45-min wait for a table. We took a walk and returned at 7.15pm. After a 5 min wait we were taken to our table.The restaurant has a great vibe about it and clearly very popular.The food was really good, service efficient but didn't ooze much charm.Would have liked to have seen more dishes on the menu. Portions were on the small side - my husband, who has a larger appetite, ordered another 3 tapas dishes after we'd finished the first round.In a nutshell, I'd definitely go back as I really enjoyed the food but if I had to make any recommendations, I would say bigger portions and more choice of food."
1269,4-07-2017 ,5.0,Came here following TripAdvisor reviews. The wait was short even it was packed on the weekend.Our favorites are octopus on yellow puree and razor claims. Razor claims are very fresh !
1270,4-07-2017 ,3.0,"This place has the vibe in town with huge lines waiting and a chaos thatcomes when you are running hot. I am afraid we found it rushed., there is an unsaid pressure to order and hurry things along and that's coming from a writer who likes to get in, enjoy and get out. The food was a 3. Look hundreds a people lining up can't be all wrong and you may enjoy it - we didn't."
1271,4-07-2017 ,5.0,"first meal in Barcelona, and awesome in spite of a long waiting line and too many tourists... (maybe this is the most popular restaurant to Chinese? I found so many) You can choose assorted tapas (5-6 dishes the restaurant chooses) but better choose tapas on your own. They have a kind of 'tapas of the day'."
1272,3-07-2017 ,5.0,We arrived just before the lunch time rush and got a table straight away. Within ten minutes the queue was out the door. And that's saying something because this place is huge! Great food. Wide range of tapas and very friendly and helpful staff. The patatas bravas with fried egg was the ultimate in comfort food
1273,2-07-2017 ,5.0,"One of my favorites at Barcelona. Maybe you cannot find a seat easily but keep trying. The only problem we had was the language, the waiters were not able to speak english except one. So we couldn't order our meal easily, but the taste of dishes and the deserts were excellent. Especially the sangria was really the best I had in Barcelona."
1274,1-07-2017 ,5.0,Really enjoyed this place.Great food at a good price.I recommend getting the potatoes and the beef tenderloin.We ordered a lot of food and we couldn't fault any of it.
1275,1-07-2017 ,5.0,"Great food, great service. Try the Flautas with Iberian ham, the tenderloin tapas or the artichoke tapas. Really nice atmosphere."
1276,30-06-2017 ,5.0,"So many yummy foods!Take a look inside, if you aren't sure what's on the menu, to get an idea of what you might like. Their fresh sardines are delightful. "
1277,28-06-2017 ,5.0,"This is a classic place you can't miss. Sometimes is a bit crowdy, but deserves to stay and wait a bit for eat there, because everything is great there: the food, the large list of tapas, the quality of the food and the kind way the waiters treat you. For me is one of the best places to eat at anytime."
1278,28-06-2017 ,5.0,"This is the second time we have visited this restaurant. The first was three years ago. You have to queue and will be told what time to come back, it is usually around an hour. Trust me it is worth it. We were told to come back in 45 mins and were not kept much longer than that. It may not looked organised but it is and they try and get you seated very quickly. We ordered drinks at the bar whilst we were waiting, be prepared it is free pour, my goodness they were strong! We ordered a couple of dishes at a time as we had seen the locals do this, think we ended up ordered approx 10 dishes in total, all delicious and a jug of sangria. Our bill came to under €40, bargain for such lovely food, the staff were very helpful and attentive considering how busy it was. We wanted to eat here again the next night but thought we should try other restaurants too, but should have just gone back here, one of the best tapas restaurants we have tired. So worth the wait of queuing. My husband does not normally queue or eat late but was happy to do both here."
1279,28-06-2017 ,5.0,"Actually went here twice while in Barcelona. It does get packed here during dinner time and it can be tight by the bar area. We waited an hour each time. We ended up going down the street and getting a drink and coming back and were promptly seated. Once seated there was plenty of room and the service was both fast and good. They have a great staff here. Always polite and attentive. The food is excellent and there is a large amount of choices, and you can order as you go. I left completely full both times. Will be visiting here should I come back to Barcelona on my travels."
1280,27-06-2017 ,5.0,"This is by far our favorite spot for late night Tapas. They have everything, They know what they are doing. The food is excellent. The wine is inexpensive. Note: Plan on waiting an hour. If you can grab stools at the Tapas Bar for the full experience. It is less crowded after 11:30pm. Have fun"
1281,26-06-2017 ,5.0,"We loved this place so much we went back a second night. The queue can get a bit chaotic (ie. a line-up out the door with people desperate to get seated) but it is worth it. Highly recommend the potato (sticks?) with egg, the tenderloin with foie (absolutely delicious), and the borrachim (I think it's rum cake). This is the stuff I would love on a tasting menu at a fancy restaurant it was just so good. It was also very reasonably priced. A must-go. "
1282,25-06-2017 ,3.0,"Really enjoyed the food, the people working there just acted like they didnt want to be there.Me and my wife shared two starters, when the check arrived they tried to charge us for two of each. When i called the waiter and asked why they sighed and rolled their eyes before they said that they was going to correct it.Probably wont return due to service, even though the food was good."
1283,25-06-2017 ,5.0,"This was not my intended restaurant for the evening we visited but I'm so pleased we were unable to get a table at my first choice as Cervezeria Catalana turned out to be my favourite tapas restaurant on our trip. If you are able to book ahead, do as it is extremely busy, however, we didn't have to wait more then 20 minutes for a table which was no hardship as we had a drink while we waited. There are two counters where you can eat but for a more relaxed meal I would recommend the restaurant area at the back.The staff were extremely efficient and knowledgeable about the food. The food was delicious and such good value. We had a huge selection of tapas, 6 glasses of wine and two deserts and the bill was under €65. I really can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Highlights were the huevos estrellados and the Camembert. "
1284,24-06-2017 ,5.0,Definitely recommend. Definitely would come back. 20 euros for two glasses of wine and way too much tapas than I could actually eat. Assorted platter was great. 
1285,24-06-2017 ,5.0,"We were on our way to another restaurant when we walked by the crowds waiting for a table here. Thinking it must be great, I popped in to see how long the wait was (1.5 hrs) but to my shock they said if our party was ready to be seated they could take us now - OK! The food was really good but I am curious if they are owned by the same folks as the tapas restaurant Vinitus because many dishes were the same - even the serving dishes were the same. We had eaten there the night before so we tried some other dishes - everything was good but the desserts were the most fun - for 2.75 eu each, we tried 5! Don't judge - you will want to try them all. The coconut pudding was my favorite. The staff was helpful and explained all the specials in English. The service is quick too! Best of all - the price was very reasonable as was Vinitus- For 4 people with 2 glasses of wine, water (which you pay for) 2-3 dishes each and 5 desserts it was only 67 eu. I think that's a great deal!"
1286,23-06-2017 ,5.0,"Went there twice during my week of holiday and plan to go back tomorrow ! Yes you have to wait a long time for a table but you can also order a drink at the bar and wait until someone is leaving to grab a seat and eat at the bar and in this case you don't have to wait for your name to be called. The two times we went, it's what we've done and had an amazing experience with the food, the staff as you're seating at the bar and the ambiance. I'm French and I've got a restaurant myself in Scotland and yes I could agree that the staff is not the most friendly but it's something quite general in Barcelona they're not the most smiling people but they're not rude and will answered any of your question. The gentleman at the door (security) is very nice ! All this to say go !! It's a very nice tapas restaurant and Do not pay attention to the bad reviews"
1287,23-06-2017 ,3.0,"Well, I was here years ago and it was stunning. This time we tried a selection of Tapas but some 4/5 were not available anymore, and most of the others were pretty average. Maybe we chose wrong (we had sea food like clams which was good but nothing special). The fried potatoes with egg were pretty tasty, though. Maybe one should have a look at the Tapas before ordering, and not choosing only from the menu. Average price (some 40 euros each)."
1288,22-06-2017 ,5.0,"My boyfriend and I came here and fell in love with the fresh seafood tapas they offer. We went to many tapas restaurants all over Spain and by far this is our friend, We loved eating at the bar and to have the opportunity to speak with the chef/waiter.The Seabass with tomato was great, any of the fresh clams were deliciousOn the way home, I stopped at the restaurant alone during my layover definitely worth the visit."
1289,22-06-2017 ,5.0,"One of the best restaurants, certainly for tapas. The place is almost always full, but I still recommend coming and waiting, it is worth it. Make sure to try the franchise fries with the egg, and the beef tenderloin with foie."
1290,21-06-2017 ,5.0,"This gem is always full! Get there early and be ready to stand in line. If you are willing to forgo the line for a table, then stand by the bar, ready to grab a seat as soon as someone finishes. The tapas here were so good that we came twice in our 4 day weekend. I liked this place and the food way way way better than ciudad comtal.We had a grilled shrimp skewer, mini burgers, an amazing mix of mushrooms with an egg on it, and a very weird dish that was so incredible... but I'm not sure what it's called ... it's a plate of thin French fries, with a tomato sauce and a friend egg on top. Before they serve it they cut up the friend egg in front of you and mix it all up! It was amazing!The deserts and sangria were also great and it wasn't expensive.Definitely worth the wait!"
1291,21-06-2017 ,4.0,"We ate here a few nights ago. The wait for a table outside was lengthy, I can't comment for inside but it looked rammed. The food was truly exceptional, and a good price. Definitely recommend the huevos cabreos which are really skinny chips with fried eggs mashed into them and a spicy tomato sauce.The waiting staff were efficient and very busy, but don't expect a warm welcome or friendly service as we got neither!"
1292,21-06-2017 ,5.0,"I have dined at this restaurant three times now on two different trips to Barcelona. I love the variety of food you will find here and I am appreciative that the menu is also in English so I can determine what I am ordering! The atmosphere and staff are wonderful, also. And I like that you can eat a little earlier here than the traditional Spanish restaurant."
1293,19-06-2017 ,4.0,"One of the great tapas restaurants in Barcelona. Always packed with both locals and tourists. Huge selection from which to choose. No doubt about it - a must visit! P.S. Because it is so darn good, it is always busy so please be prepared to wait a bit more than you may be used to. It will be worth it."
1294,19-06-2017 ,4.0,"This place is very hyped and therefor very crowded and difficult to get in without a long wait unless you go early. We tried twice to get into this place and finally went before 7pm to get in. While the food is delicious and lives up to the hype, the wait staff are really curt and barely attentive. This is beyond the usual indifference that one encounters with many waitstaff in Spain and beyond what is excusable in a very busy establishment. Its like they know that regardless of their performance, the place will always be full due to the popularity and so they don't even bother trying. So, if you go, go early and don't expect friendly, helpful or attentive service."
1295,18-06-2017 ,2.0,"Below average, and highly over rated, if you consider yourself a foodie, you will be disappointed. Every dish lacked flavor and had very little depth or development of the ingredients. It all just felt thrown together​ without any real preparation. Saving grace was the price...pretty inexpensive, €55 for 2. "
1296,18-06-2017 ,5.0,"We use to ask taxi drivers about restaurants, the driver recommended this tapas restaurant. It was our 4th time in Barcelona, no one friend suggested it for us.We went there and the first impression was very good for a tapas restaurant.The beer, the cava (sparkling wine) the tapas, the lobster paella (not every day) and the 3 ways chocolate cake, everything was so delicious we've repeated the next day and again: everything so tasteful. The price is low considering the quantity and quality we've eaten."
1297,18-06-2017 ,4.0,"This restaurant had good reviews and the long line waiting for a table was a testament to that fact. It was 45 min to an hour’s wait at 9pm on a Thursday first week of June. We added our name to the list and took a walk around the corner for a glass of wine. An hour later we were seated at our table. In the bar area it was still a zoo with all the people still waiting for tables. We got a table in the room adjacent to the bar which felt less hectic. At 10pm waiters were hustling placing orders in hopes of turning tables fast. Ordering a bottle of wine indicated we would stay longer than others. We had several waiters taking our orders but they took time explaining the dishes when asked.We wanted to try the octopus but it was sold out. They suggested cuttlefish (calamari)Grilled cuttle fish Andalusia style: Tender and very tasty with a mild garlic flavor. Score 5*Gambas aioli, a special tapas of the day, it was superb, about 5 Gambas in spicy garlic sauce. Score 5*Mushroom sauté, a day special. Wonderful mix of various mushroom . Score 5*Fried calamari with aioli: Nice mild taste, best with lots of aioli on. Score 3*To accompany all of this and for sauce scoop up: Toast with tomato and garlic oil.La Catalana “biscuit” icecream and La Catalána flan. The portion size are large enough to share. Both delicious. Score 4*We had a nice long chat and shared photos with 2 locals at the next table, regulars at this restaurant. We asked for recommendation to a few other places in the city. Generously they offered us a special coffee to share, Carraj Mascaro (unsweetened brandy).(* We rate the dishes we try on a scale from 1-5, 5 being outstanding.)"
1298,17-06-2017 ,4.0,La cervecería is always packed and they do little to nothing to accommodate you. The first time I visited them I was lucky to find a spot in the bar. The food is delicious and budget friendly! The ambiance is also good! Once you passed the horrible hostess and the other guy at the front door the experience is totally worthy. 
1299,17-06-2017 ,5.0,Based on a locals recommendation stopped by mid Saturday afternoon. We were LUCKY LUCKY LUCKY. Landed a spot very quickly ( there is often a wait involved)Absolutely fantastic food and very reasonably priced. 5 very edible serves plus 2 drinks each for a touch over 30 Euros is we think good value!This place stays on the bucket list!
1300,17-06-2017 ,2.0,Unfriendly staff! In rush to get our order and get rid of us. Plain and tasteless tapas. I can't understand how they managed to have all these excellent rating. 
1301,16-06-2017 ,5.0,We had no idea what or how to order. The friendly staff asked us what we liked and showed the way. Fresh tapas came out and amazing flavors and food. Been there twice now since we have been here three days and other tapas places we're not as fresh. 
1302,16-06-2017 ,5.0,Went with another couple (childhood friends) who had lived in Barcelona before. We were staying in the same hotel where the restaurant was too quiet and they suggested this would give us a better idea of Barcelona and they were right. The place was extremely busy but we managed to get a table within a few minutes and the whole evening went very well service/food/drink.
1303,15-06-2017 ,3.0,"We have been coming here every time we visit Barcelona for the last 9 years. This was probably the worse experience we have had. Food items forgotten, then brought out another 20 minutes after they remembered and we were about to leave. The quality on some products is still good but others just seem very oily and greasy. The Tortia was a highlight. "
1304,15-06-2017 ,4.0,"I used to work just across the street from la Cerveceria Catalana. The food is great, the staff are friendly and there are always lots of people, so you feel like you've come to a good place.If you want to go, but don't want to feel like you are with all the other tourists waiting to get a table, then try going in the morning for a late breakfast. They serve la bocata del dia (the daily bread roll) - you can choose from one of three and a cafe con leche for around 3 euros. You will see lots of locals coming in any time from 9am to midday to sit around a table with their colleagues for a twenty minute break. Great alternative to having a coffee at your desk. Off course you can splash out and enjoy more exotic food. And you may be tempted to make it part of your daily routine."
1305,14-06-2017 ,5.0,"The small cerveceria on Carrer de Mallorca is more than another beer joint. From the moment you step on the sidewalk in front of the Catalana, you are greeted by two very busy camerero/ra. They still manage to make you feel welcome and take your order subito. The food is good and varied and the price is great.Effective service with a warm attitude."
1306,14-06-2017 ,5.0,"Great food, quick service. We went for tea around 7pm so got in early and beat the queue otherwise you probably have to wait around for a table. "
1307,13-06-2017 ,5.0,"This place was so good I forgot to take a picture, because we ate it so fast! MUST try the bread pudding for dessert!!!"
1308,13-06-2017 ,4.0,"Went there to get dinner, and we loved the place.Perhaps a tad high pricerange for some, but the food quality was nice."
1309,13-06-2017 ,5.0,Went our first night in Barcelona. At 10:00pm had to wait 1hr. Seemed to be a lot of local people eating. Service was okay. Food was great tapas. We loved the Spanish omelette and vinegar sardines.
1310,13-06-2017 ,5.0,"Great staff, very good Tapas, beer selection and wines. We noticed that many of the patrons were locals who really know good Tapas... Jordi, the outside manager and our waiter Joel were prompt and attentive... Great Barcelona dining experience.."
1311,12-06-2017 ,5.0,"Amazing restaurant, always busy but busy for reason. Worth to wait for your table! Amazing food, really friendly staff. I picked this restaurant for my 30th birthday dinner and it was just perfect. "
1312,11-06-2017 ,5.0,"We had a wonderful night at Cerveceria Catalana, we sat at the bar and were able to ask questions and order wonderful food. We went at 7.30 pm and didn't have a problem getting in. Highly recommended."
1313,11-06-2017 ,1.0,"At the end of my meal the waiter stole an item of mine off the table. I didn't notice he was the one who took it off the table at first and thought it was a mistake so I asked him in English to see if it was taken by accident. He then stated he didn't speak English even though he had spoken English throughout our meal, so I asked him in Spanish if he saw my item, he said he has no idea what I was talking about. It was then that the people at my table saw him holding my item behind his back trying to hide it from me. I have always brought my friends to this restaurant when they visit Barcelona but will not anymore."
1314,11-06-2017 ,5.0,Very good tapas in a beautiful restaurant. We went at 11:30 on a Friday and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. Everything we ordered was fabulous and the wait staff was helpful in explaining the dishes to us and being careful as one in our party has a shellfish allergy. Would highly recommend!! 
1315,11-06-2017 ,4.0,"Ok let's go straight to tips section:TIPS:1) If you are not sure on what to order, ASK what they recommend. We did and our server did not fail! The tourist couple beside us ordered what they were familiar with (typical calamari, fried stuff) and they regret it as they kept saying how our food looked better (and tasted better too!)2) The line gets really long... so come early if you can.3) No Wifi here!"
1316,10-06-2017 ,5.0,"Very popular restaurant, and when you eat there you will see why,. Excellent food and very reasonable prices. The down side is you can't book, you turn up and put your name on the lists, one for inside and one for outside. We arrive at 8:30 and were told the wait for 2 people would be 90 min! But we stayed on, had a couple of drinks at the bar and in the end waited about 40 min, worth it. The food was fantastic service fast (once you got your table), and I was pleased to say when the bill turned up, even including a bottle of wine, very reasonable. The fact we arrived during a Catalan holiday weekend probably didn't help as it is very popular with the locals as well as tourists. Go for it but be prepared to wait."
1317,9-06-2017 ,1.0,"We came here for the good looking food and reviews. The bad experience started by the entrance. There was a queue, the wait ok was around ten minutes. But the lady at the door taking down names was just beyond rude. She wrote down our name and then ten minutes later she called our names but refused to acknowledge it was us. She insisted the names were of another couple and was incredibly rude to us. After calling around with no response, she finally let us in with no apology and still acting as if we were trying to cut the line. The service was slow and one waiter was just rude for no reason. We tried to order one glass of Sangria but were told WE COULD ONLY ORDER A LITTER. And when we tried to order other drinks and ask for the drink list, we were told that there is only wine and beer. No need to look at the list. The 1.8. € tapa bread were also horrible.don't come here if you want your trip to Barcelona to stay beautiful."
1318,9-06-2017 ,5.0,"This is a VERRRRY popular restaurant that does not take reservations. However, you can put your name in and they will give you an idea of when you will be seated so you can amble off and have a drink elsewhere if you desire. On our first visit, we were not seated until after 11, but besides a few of their more popular dishes not being available, the restaurant was at full steam. The kobe burger was a standout, and as most restaurants in Barcelona do, the gambas and peppers also did not disappoint. For the quality, a very good value."
1319,7-06-2017 ,3.0,"This restaurant is highly recommended, and I don't understand why. The quality of some of the tapas and other dishes offered was basic and not flavorful. There were some that were good. I also thought the restaurant worked very well and efficiently to handle the large crowd. However, what could've been a very nice dining experience in Barcelona was ruined by the awfully inattentive and non responsive wait staff attending our table. Very minimal response when questioned about certain dishes on the menu and we literally had to flag him down to get additional dishes ordered and to get the check at the end. The food was good, but not great. Overall experience was mediocre and not living up to the hype."
1320,7-06-2017 ,4.0,"Good atmosphere, nice staff, nice food. There are some vegeterian options. Looks like a popular place at evening time."
1321,7-06-2017 ,4.0,"The restaurant was extremely busy and crowded the entire time we were there. I thought we would have to wait a long time to get a table, but my colleague had arrived about 15 minutes before I did and she grabbed a spot at the bar right as I got there. The service was good but not excellent. The food was terrific. The absolutely best thing was the Crispy Camenbert. So mouth-wateringly delicious! My friend wanted a Sangria and they gave her something they called Summer Wine, which she thought was fabulous."
1322,7-06-2017 ,5.0,The service the food all excelent. However we needed to wait to get a table but it worth it . I highly recommend.
1323,7-06-2017 ,5.0,Best chipirones in town!!! Delicious sea food plates! Great humourous atmosphere. Beware they only serve paella at specific times. I would stick to sea foos tapas. Other food is average
1324,6-06-2017 ,5.0,"Ran from the Monument Hotel to catch lunch before heading to BCN. We were so happy we went to CC! Put our name in, but hopped up to the bar when 2 spots opened up. Great place to view the wide array of fresh tapas and also to watch food prep and ask questions of the friendly staff about their recommendations. Had the grilled shrimp, baguette with Brie, blue cheese and puréed olives, and split a brunch item of shoestring potatoes, peppers and poached eggs, lightly doused in a red sauce. It was all superb. Aside from the delicious, fresh tapas, the prices were reasonable, and the ingredients as fresh as they come. Can't wait to go back and try so many other dishes I saw in passing. The food is amazing! "
1325,6-06-2017 ,1.0,"Food was bland, and hot dishes sometimes came out luke warm. To top it off, something I ate there gave me a stomach ache. The staff were rude as well. Don't waste your time with this place. They might as well put a sign out front that says ""suckers are welcome"".I sure was a sucker for going. Would have been happier eating canned tuna."
1326,6-06-2017 ,5.0,"So we LOVED being her, the waiter was awesome, the food spectacular. What a wonderful catalan place to eat. Do go, do eat seafood and savor the flavors of the people and food!!"
1327,5-06-2017 ,5.0,"Travelling as a couple, we got seated immediately.Boy oh boy tapas were great.We had shrimp, so fresh. Prawns.Sangria.Potatoes.Very reasonably priced for everything."
1328,5-06-2017 ,3.0,Arrived later for some tapas and cervesas. It's a great spot on the square to people watch which is what you would stop for. The food is fairly average in quality and price but the service is fast and friendly. 
1329,5-06-2017 ,5.0,"I really loved it. The food is amazingly good and the crema catalana is just wonderful. Great ambiance, friendly bartenders."
1330,4-06-2017 ,5.0,"WOW! What a fantastic restaurant. You need to go. There is always a wait if about 45 to 90 minutes BUT it is worth it. The service and the food were outstanding. The price is extremely reasonable. A suggestion, after you give your name, order a drink at the bar. Stand by the bar, you will probably be lucky to get a seat sooner than being called."
1331,3-06-2017 ,5.0,"Excellent food, excellent staffTapas bar right in the middle of the city; flew in from London with a few snags on the travel arrangements. The resto , the food, the beer and the wine saved the dayTruly hit the spot ! "
1332,3-06-2017 ,5.0,"Great tapas, best we've had in Barcelona so far in the city center. I'm sure there are other places but the food was great, fast service and good pricing. 5/5"
1333,2-06-2017 ,4.0,"This is quite a busy restaurant. The wait was approximately 30 minutes during mid-afternoon on a weekday.Tapas are good - such as patatas bravas, shrimp brochettes, croquettes etc. Service (hostess and server) was friendly."
1334,1-06-2017 ,5.0,everytime when my friends coming to town we HAVE TO GO to the cerveceria catalan. It is still one of the best options for high quality Tapas and Drinks. No reservation possible and always FULL. Go in small groups and enjoy your waiting time with some wine or Sangriafresh and high qualityveggies and meatYOU WILL LOVE IT <3
1335,1-06-2017 ,5.0,You should definitely make a reservation before you go there otherwise you will have to wait for a long time. People are coming at 1:00am to eat these delicious tapas...!!!
1336,1-06-2017 ,5.0,"Truley excellent tapas, we went after reading the reviews on this website and they are defiantly true, the tapas is delicious, I recommend the prawn skewers, potato bravas and the chicken and ham croquettes, although everything was fabulous. And the price is very reasonable too, especially compared to some of the other tapas bars around the area. We went at around 9:30pm and were told they're was an hour wait, we got seated within 45 minutes however and were expecting a queue so didn't mind too much. I'm not sure when the quite times are to go if you don't want to queue however as we left the restaurant at around 11:30pm and people were still being told there was a 40 minute wait for a table!"
1337,31-05-2017 ,5.0,"This restaurant is not to be missed! Due to its location, I combined it with my visit to Casa Batllo. There was a long wait for groups larger than 2, I was by myself and got lucky with a seat at the bar. Excellent pinxtos and tapas. Definitely worth the TA hype. I also recommend strolling along Rambla Catalunya which seemingly doesn't get as much traffic as La Rambla is immediately parallel to it."
1338,31-05-2017 ,5.0,"So glad we found this place. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. Good wine too, the white wine sangria was a revelation. Service was great (with the exception of one rather grouchy waiter) and our servers spoke great English. Be warned, this place gets very busy and doesn't take reservations, on each visit we had to queue to put our name on a wait list and then return 45-60 mins later....but it's well worth the wait. "
1339,31-05-2017 ,5.0,"Price performance wise this place was the best meal we had in Spain so far. Half a litre of sangria for 11 euros and some great food, would definitely recommend "
1340,30-05-2017 ,5.0,"Very nice selection of Tapas, try to avoid the rush of hrs of lunch and dinner so you avoid the queues. One of the best In Barcelona for sure."
1341,30-05-2017 ,5.0,"We have been here many time, all our friends - also already know - where to get proper tapas place with friendly and fast service and great atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable, the only problem - you can't prebook it - but service is really super fast - worth to wait 10 min.."
1342,30-05-2017 ,4.0,A little pricey but food was good. We went there for brunch and has the tapas assortment and few other stuff. Recommend the mushroom and asparagus. There is also vinitos which is nearby with much nicer food! 
1343,30-05-2017 ,5.0,"Got a Gin and Tonic that was all Gin, great food and we stayed as long as we liked. Really liked the artichokes and ham"
1344,29-05-2017 ,5.0,Well... eat good full and spent almost €80 for 2 of us. Great shrimp and squid grills. Salad potato and few other things. I forgot to take pictures. But give it a try. 
1345,29-05-2017 ,5.0,"Came here in 2011 and couldn't get enough of it. 6 years later, this place still serves the most delicious dishes. The seafood tastes fresh and the veggies are cooked to perfection. The wait wasn't as long as expected and it's definitely worth the wait. "
1346,29-05-2017 ,5.0,It was a very good restaurant with many choice of all delicious foods. The price was very reasonable and the staff were very friendly. I went there four times for dinner during my 7 nights stay in Barcelona
1347,29-05-2017 ,4.0,"We were recommended here by the hotel concierge and so we tracked it down on our last day. It looked packed from the outside with people seemingly standing in a queue but we ventured inside and were able to get an inside table instantly. The food was great, service to match and priced very reasonably. Paella, Steak sandwich, beer and bottled water for <15euros. Can't fault it for somewhere to pop in for lunch. Reading other reviews, it appears to be really popular at night so reservations are probably advised. It is just away from the busyness of Passeig de Gràcia as well so you don't feel you are eating in a shop window, which is nice!"
1348,29-05-2017 ,2.0,We went at 10:30 and waited til midnight for a seat at the bar! It was so crowded and the food was just ok. They forgot my husbands orders and we gave up bc it was so late! 
1349,28-05-2017 ,4.0,"This is one of the best places to eat in Barcelona! Everything we ate was delicious. You can expect a wait but you can always go for a walk while waiting for your table. We at fried squid, octopus, assorted meats and cheese, tenderloin with fois, anchovies, pan con tomate and 5 desserts! So yummy. That being said we were misusing a knife at our table, our waiter forgot two of my drink orders both wine and dessert wine, so we only ended up getting one drink each. I highly recommend this place, and chalk the forgetfulness up to a busy restaurant."
1350,28-05-2017 ,5.0,"Even on a bank holiday Sunday we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table, and when we could drink sangria while we waited we hardly noticed! The place was busy but well staffed and the food was absolutely fantastic, especially the octopus and the patatas bravas. Not unreasonably priced either."
1351,28-05-2017 ,3.0,"This place is PACKED. Trip advisor has blown this place (and thier Egos) up. We tried for 3 consecutive days to make reservations, put our names down, and were consistently offered a chance to eat after 1.5 hours at midnight."
1352,28-05-2017 ,5.0,"Food was delicious. Tapas are really good and desserts too. Try crema catalana is a must!The place is well located, you can miss it."
1353,28-05-2017 ,5.0,"Even the pickiest of eaters can eat something amazing here. No reservations - the 3 of us came around 3pm and the place was packed, we were seated in about 20 mins. Sangria was good- almost too good that you could drink too much too fast! Great excuse for a siesta. The specials (croissant with cured meat and cheese), the fried croquettes, grilled cuttlefish, huevos on what looked like thin french fries and a few other selections set us right to keep shopping all the little boutiques the surrounding blocks had to offer."
1354,27-05-2017 ,4.0,This place on Mallorca 236 has been recommended to us by several friends so we went together with a few friends to explore. We all ordered different tapas and none of us were disappointed - especially the seafood selection is big. Although it is also a very popular and busy place and we stayed there for almost 3 hours the waiters never once put pressure on us to speed up in spite of the line of people waiting to get a table.
1355,27-05-2017 ,5.0,"Although we did not have to wait, we would wait to eat here as the food was so divine.We went for tapas (Patatas Bravas, Jamon Iberi, Solomillo con, Huevos Cabreaos and Pescadito Frito) with a pitcher of Sangria. Service was excellent. Quality of food was incredible. I had some of these tapas at other restaurants and was forever spoiled by eating here."
1356,27-05-2017 ,5.0,The best casual tapas place in Barcelona.The food is excellent and the service is very good.Quite hard to get a table so I recommend to sitting on the bar.The prices are very reasonable so I recommend to try one from everything.Don't miss it while in Barcelona!!!
1357,26-05-2017 ,4.0,"Not crowded in February and I was able to quickly get a seat at the bar in front of the massive display of tapas. (I heard that there are very long lines in summer.) I ordered some wine, a type of salad, seafood tapas and octopus - three large tentacles on top of three huge hunks of potato. It was good but I found myself trying to ignore the suction cups! They also had a tapas menu for additional hot items. Best food? Probably not. Fun for lunch? Absolutely! I would go back if I was in the area and would probably ask for the menu for something different."
1358,26-05-2017 ,5.0,"I come to Barcelona every year and I make sure I come here for nearly all my lunches. Its simply delicious. Fresh produce, efficient and fast staff, and most importantly, it's consistent. I couldn't recommend it high enough."
1359,25-05-2017 ,5.0,"food was dwlicious, its a busy place and thwre was a 45 min wait, but was worthed. we had greay experience"
1360,25-05-2017 ,4.0,"Recommended by friends who visited before, so since we had time on our last day we went for lunch. The tinto verano was delicious and the food was nice. I wouldn't say I've not had better paella but the place is buzzing. I don't mind that as it makes the restaurant lively. Had to queue for about 20 mins but worth the wait. Nice place to go with friends. The bread pudding is not to be missed !"
1361,25-05-2017 ,5.0,When in Barcelona tapas and Paella are a must and the Cerveceria Catalana is located not far from the Casa Battlo so we have it a try. First off the lineup appeared really long and we almost turned away but the restaurant itself is huge and we did t wait long. The food is good and you should order a few dishes and then order some more if you are still hungry. Enjoy!
1362,25-05-2017 ,5.0,"Recommended by two friends who visited at different times.We were sightseeing in the area and stopped here for a late lunch. The place was extremely busy and we were told the wait would be 20mins. After 8mins we were seated. The waitress was lovely & made some great recommendations in particular the hake & baby asparagus, the paella and the vegetable dishes. The food was the best tapas we have had, the cava was so good we had 2 small bottles. Definitely worth a visit "
1363,25-05-2017 ,4.0,"We sort out this restaurant based upon the 3 Days in Barcelona Guide on TripAdvisor. Initially all seemed well, a great buzz at the front with people queuing for a table etc. (Tip - don't just join a queue you need to go in and add your name to a list and wait to be called). When you are finally led to your table you realise you are in a very nice but some what soulless space - a tapas producing machine built for a fast turnaround of tables. Having said all that, the food was lovely, but no better than some other more authentic bars we had already tried. This place is a victim of it's own success!"
1364,25-05-2017 ,5.0,Perfect place to eat famous Tapas. All kind of tapas are available. Bar and restaurant parts are always crowded. If no reservation for restaurant then you can wait about half an hour. Bar is open to sit when someone leaves place. Try to eat slowly and order more as you finish your plates. No regrets. Is a must if you are in Barcelona. Prices are very reasonable.
1365,25-05-2017 ,5.0,"It does take a bit to understand the way to navigate the tapas restaurant, but once you have mastered the process it is totally enjoyable. Just try one of everything! They will all amaze! Fish and seafood and ham and chorizo with all types of accompaniments! The vegetables in season (artichokes, asparagus) are incredible. And the Spanish wines and cavas are a must to wash it all down!"
1366,24-05-2017 ,4.0,"We heard that this place was very popular with locals which seemed to be true. We went early for dining in Spain so we didn't have to wait. We enjoyed trying several tapas and everything we tried was very good. It was really fun to eat such a variety of tasty items. The olives were so delicious. I've been looking for olives that tasty back home, but I have yet to find any as good."
1367,24-05-2017 ,5.0,Loooove their Menu! Place is always busy and lively. Food is Muy Bueno!Seriously everything on their menu tastes amazing. Shrimp skewers are a fav!
1368,24-05-2017 ,5.0,"Our last trip to Barcelona brought us here and this trip we went twice. Yes it's very busy ! However also full of locals which tells you it's good ! Don't make the mistake of getting a table , wait behind people sitting at the bar and take their seat as soon as they pay. Seeing the good in front of you and interacting with the bar staff is part of the experience. The food is to die for as are the desserts which we only discovered this time round. Be adventurous, order some wine , people watch and listen to all the languages around you and enjoy wonderful food! Can't wait to return !"
1369,24-05-2017 ,5.0,"This restaurant is perfect it,s always bussy ,in you want a tablet you have to wait , but somebody gave us a tip .! Just pas the waiting in en go to the bar first you can't sit but you can't order drinks and tapas (a lot of choice) and after `10' min you can't sit at the barevery body I told about this place loved it"
1370,23-05-2017 ,2.0,"We had to wait almost an hour in a very crowded small foyer. However, this wait allowed me to see how some of their tapas were prepared. Awful !!!For example, instead of cooking the calamari with garlic and parsley, they were done by themselves, served onto a plate and then, sprinkled with a mixture of garlic, parsley and oil.The place is very crowded, the service slow and very little friendly, the selection poor and, the prices, outrageous. There are many better places were to enjoy tapas in Barcelona."
1371,23-05-2017 ,5.0,"Really good quality food, amazingly fast service. The only minor disadvantage was the tapas (carne con pimientos de padron or sth like that) with the steak which was not that tender."
1372,22-05-2017 ,4.0,"Advised to arrive early or there'll be a queue. Got there at 18:45 to be told there was a twenty minute wait for a table. Although it only turned out to be a ten minute wait. Food was good & good value too, tapas for two, bottle of wine & two drinks are the bar all for under £40, that's probably why it's busy! When we left they were queuing on the street."
1373,22-05-2017 ,5.0,"We called in for lunch - as we had not booked we had to wait at the bar for 20 minutes but the wait was well worth it. We put ourselves in the waiters hands and he brought us a fabulous tapas lunch - starting with Catelonian ""egg and chips"" and then going on to plates of gambas, beef, calamari etc followed by three deliciuos sweets. Portion sizes just right and the bill for food drinks and coffee was a very reasonable Euro 140 for four."
1374,22-05-2017 ,3.0,"The restaurant was a block from our hotel and we saw the line of people waiting to get in. Also our guide told us it was fabulous. We had an early dinner thre so we didn't have to wait in line and I'm glad we didn't. The food was fine, but nothing outstanding. The service was so-so - she treated us like it we should be honored to be able to eat in their restaurant."
1375,21-05-2017 ,3.0,"Often I hear lots of tourist it is a fantastic restaurant and in fact it used to be a great one. I used to work near it and I often ate at Cervecería catalana but for the last years it has become just a touristic place, with no customer service, where they treat customers as numbers and food as pieces of a puzzle that needs to work perfect. Avoid it if you think you will be tasting catalán food. It is just a touristic average price place to eat fast and in an uncomfortable way."
1376,21-05-2017 ,5.0,"Tapas were very delicious, try especially four cheese and grilled green peppers. White sangria is too sweet if you don't want to have a too sweet drink. Ambience and food is nice though"
1377,21-05-2017 ,5.0,"We stopped here for a late lunch and had a fantastic meal. The croquetas, spanish omelette, and fried anchovies ""andaluz style"" were especially delicious... An extensive menu (printed in 4-5 languages) and attentive service definitely make this a winner. "
1378,20-05-2017 ,5.0,Wait and do the line.Few times you find a traditional place so good and so good price. Quality quantity are excellent.The house wine its delicious. Been ther more than ten times. Wait no matter the time.Its the best tapas ever in my opinion. By the way Beer too.
1379,20-05-2017 ,5.0,"As much as possible, try to book a table ahead as it is packed almost round the clock. Everything was delicious and don't forget to fit in dessert at the end and would highly recommend the Torrija Cremada de Sta. Teresa (creme brulee in cinnamon pastry). "
1380,18-05-2017 ,5.0,"Good Sangria, loved the small sandwiches! Assorted Tapas and Assorted salads were tasty. Visited this Tapas with 14 other friends for lunch. They divided us into to adjacent tables. They had English menus. Great atmosphere!!! Totally recommend it!"
1381,17-05-2017 ,5.0,Wow...what a great food they have! Next time I will definitely go again :)You will probably have to wait a couple of hours to get a table in here...but it's also fine to eat at the bar! It's full of people all the time. But it worth to go and taste all the specialties. 
1382,17-05-2017 ,4.0,"Go during the afternoon, when the crowds manageable. 1 to 1.5 hour waits at 10 and 11 pm at night! Tried on a sunday and monday night and gave up. Its good, but just not worth it. Great tapas. Jamon is great, as are gambas (shrimp). Croquetas good. All comes out out the kitchen hot and freshly made. Staff and waiters super friendly."
1383,16-05-2017 ,5.0,"Lucky me, no reservation needed. Had a mixture of different Tapas, very fresh & delicious ... loving padrón peppers. Very creative way to present the desserts, Attentive service... Go there and make your choice, it's worth visiting."
1384,16-05-2017 ,5.0,"During our entire visit to Spain, I never really saw people waiting for tables. On a Saturday night, the wait was 90 minutes and probably 30+ people waiting outside. Quite chaotic. Coming back on a Sunday, it was much easier to get a table. I also noticed a fair number of locals and regulars dining here. The service staff was not friendly and just seemed to want to turn over tables. They also weren't helpful. There was no drink menu and when asked, they just said they had ""wine and beer"" as if there were just one option in each category. A bit annoying. The food was really worth it. Creative tapas and montaditos of the day. Desserts were also artistic and tasty. "
1385,16-05-2017 ,4.0,Great place. Be there in time as you can't make any reservations. Typical Spanish bar/bodega. The food is really delicious. Only tapas but all great. Try the shave Artichoke fried. Crispy and nice. Also the Solomio is fantastic. When you are with a group better be complete because the won't give you the table if you aren't. Buzzling place.
1386,15-05-2017 ,5.0,"Best tapas in town! This is the restaurant that put Barcelona on the culinary map! Being popular, I came here at 7 PM on a weeknight only to find that there was a 30 minute wait. Luckily, there was bar seating so I didn't have to wait after all, but expect to wait at least an hour if you come after 8 PM when the locals start their dinner. Prior to that time, you'll see mostly tourists who eat their meals during ""normal"" times. I had the mini burgers, Spanish omelette, shrimp and crap mix with their bread with tomato paste, patatas bravas, some egg hash dish, beef tenderloin, and calamari. The only thing I thought was over-rated was their patatas bravas, which just tasted like potatoes. It wasn't crispy to my liking. But the other things....oh my gosh, you can't get any better than that! I was full but couldn't stop eating. The tenderloin was tender and oh so flavorful, the egg hash dish was like eating a good morning breakfast, but the best part was the shrimp and crab mix with their bread with olive oil and tomato paste. It was the first time I had that kind of jam, and it was absolutely delicious.This place may run you about 20 euro per person, give or take a few depending on how much you eat and drink, but they do accept credit cards. Each tapas plate was about 3-6 euro each.I think eating here ruined me because no other tapas place in Spain paled to Cerveceria Catalana, except for the sister restaurant, Ciudad Condal. This is a MUST-TRY if you're ever in Barcelona, and if I ever come back, this will be my first stop."
1387,15-05-2017 ,4.0,Came here for dinner on a Monday evening and were very lucky to be seated within 10 minutes. This is a very popular establishment and you can see why. Food was delicious; try the assorted Tapas if your struggling to make up your mind from the wealth of choice on the menu. The Cava is good too. Overall excellent value for money. 
1388,13-05-2017 ,5.0,"This place was absolutely rammed with well over an hour wait and we were lucky to squeeze ourselves into a tiny corner of the bar to try some of the best tapas we found in Barcelona. Some of the highlights were Octopus with pork belly and prawn, artichokes, razor clams, stuffed scallops, and anchovies. Everything we tried here was good. The freshness of the food was evident, and the food was prepared in a manner which highlighted the quality of the ingredients. We came here on the recommendation of our host, a local of Barcelona, and I will pass on his recommendation to others with confidence after enjoying a great meal here myself."
1389,11-05-2017 ,3.0,"Always busy for lunch, 15 minute wait for a table, which is not to bad. Selection of tapas was superb, and presented well. The only down side is the dishes have far too much salt, the cuttlefish was almost inedible.Waiting staff very attentive. "
1390,11-05-2017 ,5.0,The tapas were very tasty and the Sagria was lovely. It's very busy so make sure that you book a table if you are more than 2 people.
1391,11-05-2017 ,5.0,"Since it is a very popular restaurant, the waiting times are long (about 30-45 minutes most of the time) but the wait is totally worth it. The food is delicious and they have a great variety of plates. We had sangria which was delicious, not too strong but sweet in flavor. We ate some tapas (whole plate) and montaditos (sold by unit). For dessert, we ate the crema catana which is something you need to try when you visit Barcelona. I will definitely come back to eat here if I ever came back to Barcelona and recommend to anyone travelling there."
1392,11-05-2017 ,4.0,"We went there on an evening after getting back from Montserrat. We already expect the wait will be very long even at 10PM. In the end - instead of putting our name on the list, we waited for the bar instead which is also equally long and torturous. *But at least we can see the food during the wait. After an hour of waiting, we finally got our seat and we started to think that the food is not worth one hour wait while standing. However, it all changed after tasting the huevos cabreados and their mini small little cute grilled squid (*that I forgot the name). Secretly thanking my friends who recommended me to this place. Eating on the bar is also nice because we can coverse with the people working behind the bars which are very friendly.All in all, we left at 1 AM with a stomach full of good food and smile on our face and our wallet because it was not as expensive as our expectation."
1393,9-05-2017 ,5.0,Despite the wait (about half an hour at lunch time- helped by half a litre of Sangria) Cerveceria Catalana is amazing. The staff were great and the Tapas was delicious! And great value as well. We were stuffed by the end of our meal and only spent €25!
1394,8-05-2017 ,5.0,We stopped by for drinks & tapas after a great walk in the market. They were delicious and the drinks were very good as well. Only downside is I left my sunglasses there. Not their fault. Lol. But it was a fun exciting place!
1395,8-05-2017 ,4.0,"Despite long waits, the staff is friendly and try to accommodate all locals and the tourist with their special wishes. Lots of options in regard to the variety of tapas, accompanied with good local wines. Our waiter spoke several languages and gave us very good recommendations in regard the daily specials."
1396,8-05-2017 ,5.0,"It was our second time in this place and I wish I had time to go again & again. Great food. One of the best places to eat in Barcelona. No reservations and yes there is a long wait, but truly worth it. Will eat there each time I visit Barcelona :)"
1397,7-05-2017 ,5.0,"This is one of the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona, when we entered we saw a big waiting line with min waiting time as 60 mts. We were very lucky to find a place at the bar!! The food is really worth the wait. There were lots of vegetarian options we well. Highly recommended. Even the desserts are amazing. This tapas bar is definitely a MUST VISIT place in Barcelona!!"
1398,7-05-2017 ,5.0,"We arrived at about 9.45pm and were told there would be an hour and half wait, it has a very small bar area just inside the door and there were people sat at the bar drinking so there was no room to wait inside, so we had to wait on the pavement with the other people waiting for a table. We would have gone elsewhere but the waitress told us that a table hadn't turned up so we were lucky to only wait 30 minutes. It was worth the wait. I would suggest getting there earlier so if you do have to wait you are not waiting too late.There was 9 of us in total and we ordered a couple of starters to share then we each ordered two tapas and it was more than enough. We also ordered two jugs of sangria to wash it down, All the dishes were well presented and all very tasty. The atmosphere was fantastic and the service was very good.I would definitely go back but just make sure I arrived a bit earlier."
1399,7-05-2017 ,4.0,"It's chaos. If you want to sit outside you have to find the person who looks after the outside list. If you want to sit inside it's a different person. We sat inside. We waited about 15 minutes for seats (which a couple who walked in and sat straight down in as we were walking over, and we had to tell them to move). The service was not with a smile or in anyway helpful. My Spanish isn't great but I've not had a problem until here. Abrupt and dismissive and generally rude. However, it's totally worth that because the tapa is delicious and not expensive. We had the assorted tapas, calamari, potatas bravas, a glass of wine and a beer and it was €34 and we were full. All cooked perfectly and really yummy. I would return despite the chaos. "
1400,7-05-2017 ,5.0,"We came here on a recommendation from a local. We did have a bit of a wait, but the food and sangria more than made up for it. If we had been staying in Barcelona a few days longer, we probably would have come back for dinner here again.From the croquettes to the clams to the prawns and the sangria, everything we tasted was excellent."
1401,7-05-2017 ,5.0,The queues are long but worth it. The food is fantastic. Definitely go back soon. Highly recommended.
1402,7-05-2017 ,5.0,"No pre-booking, turn up and put your name down for a table. Often the wait is short then that quoted as people don't want to wait. Go grab a beer from a nearby bar and go back and check your progress of name on the list.Main tapas menu available in English, specials menu in Spanish (download a free google translate app that you can use off line). Food excellent, wines reasonably priced and service excellent.Save room for a desert these are excellent and you could order a few to share to make the most of the menu."
1403,6-05-2017 ,3.0,"Called in on Thursday evening and joined the queue of tourists to get a table. By the time we sat down they were quoting 90 mins waiting time. Place is much bigger than it looks from outside and modern style, and the food was very good at an ok price but it felt a bit like you were on a conveyor belt as they tried to cope with all the people wanting to eat. Although they were all good we had 4 different waiters serve us and I missed the friendly interaction at smaller places. We were surrounded by American and Japanese tourists (yes I know I'm also a tourist) and I think unfortunately it has become a victim of its own success. Go for good food but don't expect an authentic experience."
1404,5-05-2017 ,4.0,"This restaurant was highly recommended for sampling Spanish cuisine and close to our accommodation. We were warned that there would be a wait and we were prepared to do so.It was well worth it! The choices given for Tapas were great and we ordered a wide selection and some recommended dishes. All tasty . Service fast and friendly. Reasonably priced food and drinks. We all thought it was cheap when comparing to prices in Australia. Approximately 8 Tapas plates two shared Desserts , beer and bottle of wine, for two couples = € 70. Good value for us. "
1405,5-05-2017 ,4.0,If you like fish this is a must great food great prices open till lare.rasy accessible would go again
1406,5-05-2017 ,5.0,"Wow, this was a little gem. We had travelled to Barcelona for meetings with our Spanish office and this place was a block or so away from their office. We let our Spanish hosts order the food and it was amazing. The Iberico ham was truely wonderful but what stole the show for me was the beef with foie gras on top - OMG! Would recommend this place but if you're eating outside make sure you have your valuables hidden as apparently it has been known for people to dash and grab your phone/wallet off the table and run off, but don't let this put you off!"
1407,5-05-2017 ,5.0,"My wife, daughter and friend visited this restaurant on Wednesday evening at about 7.30pm to find a queue of around twenty people waiting outside an already full place.My daughter had the presence of mind to approach a 'Mature' waiter who instructed her to place her name on the waiting list and a table would be free soon. I recommend that anyone visiting this place does not just wait passively at the back of a queue but places their names on that list which in turn is scrutinised by the waiting staff. We were approached by the same waiter and seated within ten minutes. I should imagine in 'High Season' this place might resemble the Pamplona Bull Run when trying to get in?The service was friendly and informative and we were warmly greeted despite the demands of the heaving masses being dealt with by the staff. Over the length of the meal we ordered a beer, three glasses of very good wine and a bottle of Cava Brut which was very good (apparently). We ordered around a dozen different Tapas dishes between us and three sweets at the end of the meal. All of the food was delicious, well presented, innovative, and extremely well seasoned. The puddings?, sweets? not sure really because one of them was a Catalan creme brulet, another was a bread pudding and another a deconstructed apple pie, all puddings in my book!, were all to die for too.We had a fantastic meal for four with drinks in a beautiful city for the princely sum of 82 Euros total, the bill was almost as sweet as the Apple pie!"
1408,4-05-2017 ,1.0,"First off, we chose this place because of the 4.5 star rating of their Paella and Tapas. We tried to make reservations, but apparently they don't take them, so when we arrived it was absolute chaos and ended up waiting for 45 minutes to be seated. Upon being seated, we ordered their Sangria - it tasted just like fruit punch, (specifically Hawaiian Punch for those familiar with the brand) so super sweet and unlike any of the other good to average Sangria's we tasted during our time in Spain. Next, we tried to order 2 of the special's of the day including their Paella, and they were sold out of both. As for the 5 tapas dishes we did order, they all lacked basic flavoring , came without sauce, were undercooked and highly overpriced. In our two weeks traveling around Spain, this restaurant, most glaringly the food and drink was by far and away the worst. "
1409,4-05-2017 ,4.0,"I ve been living in Barcelona for 2 years and I still go there, even though i know tons of other tapas places, it just never disapoint ! "
1410,3-05-2017 ,5.0,"Best Tapas in town, with affordable price, very good food, good ambience, The tapas is so nice, foie grass best"
1411,2-05-2017 ,5.0,"Simply delicious tapas restaurant, apparently THE tapas place to come!Given the reputation it is obviously super full, though I'd recommend you to go, leave your name on the book and ask how much would it normally take to get a table and go for a drink around or even a small walk! Works all the time :)"
1412,2-05-2017 ,5.0,The food was delicious!! I ordered all the seafood dishes and it was all so tasty. The price was affordable! The wine and beer was good and cheap. The service was friendly and fast. I came here 2x during my 3 days vacation. I would recommend this place when you're in Barcelona.
1413,2-05-2017 ,5.0,"Still as busy as ever and the food quality, service and drinks are still very good. You will more than likely have to wait for a table, however, it has a good crowd so you won't be bored and can have a drink whilst you are waiting. I tried the Bread Pudding for dessert and it was extremely good."
1414,2-05-2017 ,5.0,"I go to Barcelona many times when I want nice tapas I go to this restaurant is the best in tapas, the quality is very good and you can feel the fersheness of the product the service is very quick, the price good, I totaly recomend this place. the only bad thing they have sometimes you need to wait for table more than one our."
1415,2-05-2017 ,4.0,"Good food, good tapas but too crowded even at noon in the middle of the week. We ate at better tapas bars in bacelona but less crowded "
1416,2-05-2017 ,5.0,"Family dining, affordable, attentive staff, quick food delivery, other families present, both tourists as well as nontourists. If there is a long line, it is because they are awaiting a table/ the maitre d' to call out their name. Meaning, put your name in and then stand around. They won't seat you unless your entire group is present."
1417,1-05-2017 ,5.0,"Stopped mid-afternoon for a light lunch and found an amazing menu of traditional tapas as well as some specials of the day. It's hard to recall all the options, but I would suggest you go and ask your waiter for some ideas. They have a wonderful selection of wines too!"
1418,1-05-2017 ,5.0,"We popped in here for brunch during a day of walking exploring. We grabbed bacon and cheese baguettes and a drink each. It was really good food, service was speedy and it only cost us around €8 all in. Bargain! "
1419,30-04-2017 ,5.0,"Yes, there was a wait, but the busyness was because it's good! The place is large and modern and was slammed on the evening we were there but the staff were efficient (but didn't rush us) and we were seated pretty quickly. We had an assortment of tapas among us (mostly seafood) and loved trying them all. If your hotel is close by, don't miss the fun and good eats!"
1420,30-04-2017 ,5.0,"Stopped for lunch on Sunday around 12:30 not bad 15 minute wait when we left it was 1hour. The tapas were very good and the servers friendly,we ate outside which seemed an easy place to get a table and the price was right."
1421,30-04-2017 ,5.0,"Picked this place out of a guide book and was very glad we did. A fantastic menu of freshly cooked dishes, all of which you can see being cooked in an open prep area. Fast and friendly service and very reasonably priced, especially considering how popular it is. You can sit at the bar and snack or be seated at a table and enjoy a larger meal. Well worth a few visits. "
1422,29-04-2017 ,4.0,We ate here by accident. Our hotel concierge recommended it and we thought we would pop in -- not ones to wait in long lines -- we had been warned there would be a wait and it would be crowded. We were offered a table after a very short wait 20mins. We decided to walk around the block and return for our table. Worked perfectly. The food was delicious and worth the wait. The flavorings subtle and on point. The service was a little disjointed but added the atmosphere. We had dinner the next night with friend who lives in Barcelona and he mentioned Cerverceria Catalana is one of the top places for locals to eat tapas too. 
1423,27-04-2017 ,5.0,"A friend who lived in Barca 30 years ago recommended this restaurant, which was confirmed by the more recent reviews of others. We went at 8:00 pm on a rainy Tuesday eve and it was out the door with people. Managed to squeeze a spot at the bar. House Tinto was excellent and helped to wash down the several tapas we sampled. Shrimp were excellent particularly the dish where they swim in hot garlic butter. The mushroom and asparagus was a delight but the mixed mushrooms served with an egg on top are not to be missed. The squid were sublime and the beef tapas was a nice hot but. My wife had the Greco salad which on top of the mushrooms, asparagus and others, show the range of dishes vegetarians can also enjoy. Could not eat or drink anymore and the bill was 30 euro. Had tapas for lunch but the offerings here were different and all delish. Great spot. Worth the wait. Reputation is well deserved. "
1424,27-04-2017 ,3.0,"Yes, this is modern, clean, convenient, large variety of tapas and is very popular.Having said that, there are many other tapas restaurants throughout the city offering better."
1425,26-04-2017 ,5.0,"This was our first tine here. They came with such glowing reviews we were excited to try them out. We waited a but for a table but it was more than worth the wait. The service, the selection and the price were beyond excellent. Everything we ordered was delivered at precisely the perfect time. One plate after anothert. Everything cooked to perfection and service secoond to none."
1426,26-04-2017 ,4.0,"Very nice lunch with great tapas for me and my companion. A very pleasant experience indeed. It is a very popular restaurant, but it seemed we beat the que by coming for lunch at 1230."
1427,25-04-2017 ,2.0,"Myself and my partner had both been recommended this restaurant by a few friends and were impressed by the positive reviews.We initially attempted to eat here on Sunday (St Jordi's Day) but the queue was well out of the door, we expected a queue but put the extra busyness down to the holiday. We visited again today and after a few minutes of trying to work out the system, a waiter advised my partner that we should speak with the lady inside the restaurant to put our name down. She advised the wait would be 45 minutes - 1 hour.Upon our return we waited another 10 minutes and accepted a table outside, they had heaters so this wasn't a problem. We'd been for our first Tapas experience the previous day so had an idea of how much to order. Although we were given an english menu, the specials weren't translated and they were not explained to us. We ordered a few items (iberian ham, mini hot dogs, green not-so-hot peppers, fried camembert, fried cuttlefish, pasta salad, chicken and ham croquettes, pork loin with black pepper) and were sadly disappointed. Most of the dishes were over oiled or just generally bland (given the reviews, this was not what we were expecting at all). The service was okay but not very personal. I wonder if this restaurant is so busy, just because it's busy. Despite not enjoying the food too much, the sangria was lovely."
1428,25-04-2017 ,5.0,"We came across this place while walking around on our first day in Barcelona and it was packed with locals. We thought we had to give it a try...and we did, three times. For breakfast, the croissants are amazing! I loved it with Iberian ham while my wife couldn't get enough of the Nutella variety. For dinner we tried a variety of tapas and all were wonderful. My favorite were the prawn skewers!"
1429,24-04-2017 ,4.0,"Go before 8:30 PM as the restaurant gets packed!! Loved the steak tapas with charred pepper and the mushroom tapas was also excellent. Have to try the Jamon (ham) on bread is very good,"
1430,24-04-2017 ,5.0,"A great place where we had tapas and drinks. Busy but a good atmosphere and fast professional service, food came quickly. We had about nine tapas dishes and a drink each (3 of us) for about 60 euros. Tasty food, definitely worth a visit."
1431,23-04-2017 ,4.0,"THis big restaurant give you value for money. It is a big restaurant and have a lot of guests. You might have to queue to get in but it is worth waiting. You get a good choice of differnt dishes and drinks. Since the restaurant is rather big you may think that the service will be slow, but that is not the case. The service is very efficient and the serving is quick.The food is also of good quality and well prepared. This is a berwery and the beer of this house is very good and can be recommended. The noise inside is no problem and we found everything pretty good."
1432,23-04-2017 ,5.0,"Excellent food, stylish place, go early (noon) to avoid queue. We sat at the bar with a good view of all the tapas "
1433,22-04-2017 ,5.0,"The service was both friendly and professional. The food was great, we had 5 dishes and enjoyed every one of them. Very friendly to vegetarians. Highly recommended."
1434,22-04-2017 ,4.0,"Prepare to wait in line...this restaurant is super popular and most people have to wait at least 20-30 minutes before getting a table outside or inside. I learned the hard way that you must put your name inside with a person and outside with another person. They have someone else in charge of outside seating. It was worth the wait. The food was very very delicious. You must get the pitcher of Sangria, it was one of the best I've ever had. One dish that's a must try is the one with a fried egg on top of thinly cut potatoes, they mix it up and there's a tomato sauce which is soo good."
1435,22-04-2017 ,5.0,"So, so good. Every time I go to Barcelona I go here, and recommend the restaurant to my friends that are visiting. Don't turn up when you're hungry as the queues are usually pretty lengthy, but it's one of the only restaurants that I will wait for. Love it, great selection and absolutely everything is outstanding."
1436,20-04-2017 ,5.0,"Very nice Tapas restaurant, no queue during lunch time, very tasty small courses. Not expensive one but highly recommended. "
1437,20-04-2017 ,3.0,Nice place..clean...good service...good food...just small portions (but I guess this is tapas style) and I found it expensive...be ready also at queuing at the entrance! :)
1438,20-04-2017 ,5.0,"Huevos estrellados are a must! And the montaditos of jamón ibérico, grilled artichoke and torrija were also outstanding. "
1439,19-04-2017 ,5.0,"So we researched this place and I must say the ""STARS"" are honest. The food is so good, the service excellent, and the location perfect. I totally recommend this place. Although I can't remember all that I ate I know that if it looks good, it is good. Just do it like I did, look at your neighbors table and see what they are eating. I pretty much copied them and it was great. GOOD PRICE!!! that was the best part so my family and I over ate."
1440,19-04-2017 ,5.0,"We were recommended to visit here by a friend and what a fab friend she is, this place is incredible! The dishes are fresh, tasty, served promptly, and with enthusiasm. We were given some sound advice regarding what to choose from the menu (and there's plenty of choice!) and even ended up ordering extra portions as everything was so delicious! The atmosphere is vibrant and authentic and the sangria was excellent. We got here fairly early (7pm) and did not have long to wait for a table but by the time we left at 8.30 the queue was building outside....but I can see why people flock here, its just fab!"
1441,19-04-2017 ,5.0,One of the best tapas restaurants that i ever visited in Barcelona. Highly recommended! good foods and services. Restaurant still crowded even when we arrived about 11.30pm. Please reserve to prevent disappointment. 2 thumbs up!
1442,18-04-2017 ,5.0,"Our daughter put us on to this place, where she and her husband dined several times in Barcelona. It is in L'Eixample, a block or two or three from La Pedrera, Casa Battlo, Casa Amatllo and many more. If you're into the Modernistas, you should make this your go-to for lunch, snacks, or more. It is traditional Catalan, tapas and more, very reasonably priced, but very popular. Our first visit, we waited 40 minutes, but were very happy we did.. Two other visits were earlier in the day, so not so much a wait. Service excellent, too."
1443,18-04-2017 ,5.0,this is another excellent experience we had at this restaurant that is a a sister restaurant to the great Vinitus. This and Vinitus are a must and they both share almost the same menu
1444,18-04-2017 ,5.0,"When my wife used to live in Barcelona (10 years ago) we used to eat here often, and 10 years on, its still as good as it was back then! Every time we visit Barcelona, we stop by this restaurant, and the service and the quality of food is always exceptional. It is always crowded and busy, but that just adds to the atmosphere. The selection of food is huge, and everything on the menu is incredible. Will definitely be coming again next time we visit the city!"
1445,17-04-2017 ,5.0,Great food!!! Excellent prices but very long queue time during peak hours. Wide selection of tapas and pinchos on the bar. 
1446,17-04-2017 ,5.0,A wonderful & yummy tapas meal with fresh seafood. It was crowded when we arrived & we were lucky to be able to find seats at the counter. Service was fantastic.
1447,16-04-2017 ,5.0,"This place is extremely good! Recommend it to everyone! Had to wait more than an hour, but we expected that, since I've read that it's very popular and there's lots of people. The prices are ok, sangria was a bit expensive. But the tapas are simply delicious!!! We had a big plate mix, with big shrimps, fried calamari, fried jalapeños, some oysters and some fried diced fish. Everything was amazing and we were craving for more! Also order a little sandwich with tenderloin steak. It had salt and a jalapeño on the top and wow!! Can't describe how good the meat was, tender and juicy, delicious! Nice staff and all. Would be back for more."
1448,16-04-2017 ,3.0,Came here for dinner and ended up not sticking around for the hour-long wait. We returned the next day for lunch and the wait was 45 minutes and we decided to wait it out to see what the hype is about. The food was good but didn't live up to the expectations. The place we ended up going to for dinner was much better and without the wait.
1449,16-04-2017 ,5.0,"This place was extremely busy, we had to wait over an hour but it was well worth it! Had all the traditional tapas and they were all cooked perfectly. We sat outside and had a lovely waiter. Would definitely save this place to eat at again!"
1450,16-04-2017 ,5.0,"Cervecería Catalana is about fresh, fresh ingredients prepared just right. This place is a mix of travelers and locals. Go early or late (think ""going at 8 and I will wait!!!""). I am not pastry or desert person, but their version of Creme 'Brulee just nailed it. Writing this on our first night here, it is a place we will return to on this trip. The Pardon peppers were perfect."
1451,15-04-2017 ,1.0,"We loved everything we ate but 10 hours later at 5 in the morning was a different story. We tried to discount the fact that it was here. We had a light breakfast at the Hilton, which digested fine. Then ate a late lunch/early dinner here and nothing after. My body rejected it. The flavor of what we had was great but something got us. Me worse than my newlywed wife, who didn't eat as much. Unfortunately I think this place gave us a foodborne illness"
1452,15-04-2017 ,5.0,Best Razor clams ever and you pick what you want and they cook it and serve it hot to your table. I went at 9p with my family of 5 (2 elderly parents and 2 young kids) and we lucked out with a table because the wait was 1 hour right after we got our table and it was packed. Definitely worth a wait and visit. Tapas. Service was fast and efficient it appears the staff is used to large crowds and wait
1453,15-04-2017 ,5.0,"Arrived there at 3 something, there was a Long queue in front of the restaurant. The staff advised us to wait 45 mins. So, we had a drink at the restaurant next door first. When we back, we were invited to the reserved table immediately. Interior design: modern , but it's quite packed ; not much space between tablesService: nice, all the dishes introduced by the staff were excellent Food: great with reasonable price. Love the baby squid and the garlic prawn. "
1454,14-04-2017 ,5.0,"If you want tapas, go here. But be prepared to wait for quite some time since it is not possible to book a table (or at least we couldn't figure out how to). As two people, we were asked to wait between 30 and 60 minutes for the two times we went. In reality, we only waited 20 and 45 minutes but we might have been lucky. I can imagine a long waiting time if you are more than 4 people. Practical advice/""How to"": 1) enter the restaurant and head to the counter where you will ask for the table. 2) They will then give an estimated waiting time and ask for your name. 3) Take a drink at a nearby place or go shopping. 4) Come back a bit before the waiting time. 5) Enjoy fabulous food. "
1455,14-04-2017 ,5.0,"I came to this place by the recommendation of my hotel. Apart from lots of people visiting this place, which proves, how delicious the food is, the meal was excellent. You can also sit at the bar and have a view of what you want to eat - the food is directly in front of you. I've tried lots of different meals there and each one was mastered to perfection. Seafood, cheese, spanish jamón, chorizo, meat, salads and much much more. The combination of the ingredients is really fantastic. Besides that, they serve delicious local wine and beer. Apart from this, they offer desserts, which are so lovely that they are the perfect ending of this wonderful meal. I absolutely recommand this place, but be careful, during rush hours be prepared to wait a while for a table. It's definitely worth it. Finally, the prices are really ok, I was shocked as I expected a far higher price of my meal. If you want an excellent tapas for a reasonable price, this is definitely a place for you"
1456,14-04-2017 ,4.0,We visited this restaurant after reading the good reviews and we were not disappointed. We couldn't get in the first night as too busy but went back (before 7pm) the following night. The food was amazing and inexpensive- the service speedy and great atmosphere. We went back the following night!
1457,13-04-2017 ,5.0,"We stayed in Barcelona and ate out everyday. This was the best restaurant we went to. The host was warm and polite. Our waiter, William, and the other staff were friendly, fast and we ordered everything he recommended. The shrimp skewers were divine. I don't like fries but they had something similar to it with eggs and we got the spicy option. It was truly memorable! We also had the steak sirloin tapas, the pasta, and the gambas al ajillo. For dessert, we ordered the apple tart. Everything in this place was great! We will come back here on our last day to celebrate our vacation in Spain. "
1458,13-04-2017 ,5.0,One of the best tapas restaurants. It is always crowded and with a long waiting line but it worth a try and you will want to come back alwyas
1459,13-04-2017 ,4.0,We had lunch and after 15 minutes waiting we were seated. All dishes were tasty especially the fish paella. Even though we had 6-7 dishes the price was only Eur 48. Definitely recommended.
1460,13-04-2017 ,5.0,"You have to wait in a line, however the line moves very quickly. And it's worth waiting :) every single dish is delicious, one of th best, if not the best, tapas bar I have been to. During 4 days stay been there 3 times ;) foie, artichokes, calamares mmmm bonitos :D"
1461,12-04-2017 ,4.0,Nice restaurant with good tapas.A wide variety of tapas. You will find something tasty for sure.Its always full of people. You need to be early or queue up for a long time.Its a must if you visit Barcelona.
1462,12-04-2017 ,4.0,"This restaurant has a fix preset menu with almost ready items displayed to order , always waiting time minimum of 20 mins.All food is fresh with good quality and good portion Good value of money; a must visit in Barcelona Desert was so good as well"
1463,11-04-2017 ,5.0,"I believe this is the best place in BARCELONA to have a delicious ""brocheta de langostinos"" their SAVOIR FAIRE is just incredible. I used to go very often when visiting Barcelona. Best time to go aftef midnight taking a place on the ""barra"" on my own testing the new dishes. My top 5 are :brocheta de langostinoscuatro quesosmini hamburguesitaesparragos a la planchahuevo estrellados/pan con tomateI cannot wait to get there sometime very soon."
1464,11-04-2017 ,5.0,"Without doubt the best Tapas ever - Cerveceria Catalana was highly recommended to us prior to our visit, and exceeded expectations.I was a little weary that it would be as good an experience as we were hoping for, having read the odd negative comment around service, and cramped space - but we experienced neither - indeed the service was welcoming and not rushed (despite queues building up outside) - and the food of course was glorious, with the waiter's recommendations tailored to our tastes, rather than simply pushing that days specials, and the staff's English much better than my Spanish.The Patas Bravas in particular proved to be the best we would eat during our stay in Barcelona, the Camembert and Beef Tenderloin were also outstanding - and I would recommend leaving sufficient room for dessert - the fried bread pudding in particular - all washed down with their rather agreeable Sangria.Lots of choice on the menu to appeal to all tastes, even a fussy 'tween-ager'...Yes, it gets very busy, and the later you get there, the longer the queue, as you can't book - we got there at 7pm, and only waited 10-15 mins"
1465,11-04-2017 ,5.0,A great restaurant that takes the basic Tapas food and upgrades it to high levels. I have been there several times during the past years and it always maintains its products and food's quality. it's a pity you cannot reserve a table in advance and have to hold the line to get a place.
1466,10-04-2017 ,3.0,"Good, but seems a little overrated relative to some other tapas we had in Barcelona. Could have been that we sat outside because wait for a table inside was so long. Table are pretty close together outside and other diners smoked between courses. Just got the feeling that a little more care and finesse could have been put into the food. Beef tenderloin was excellent though. "
1467,10-04-2017 ,5.0,"Very nice place in a great location. It offered a big variety of tapas in small portions, so we managed to taste quite a lot. I highly recommend the spanish omelette and the crispy camembert. It is great value for money, it is big, open during the whole day, and is very cosy! "
1468,10-04-2017 ,5.0,"Food is fantastic whatever you try ( crispy camembert, tenderloin, foie gras on sirloin, shrimps, clams etc. Service superb. Highly recommended."
1469,10-04-2017 ,5.0,Great place for tapas but always fully booked be it lunch or dinner. Lots of tourists and noisy but all worth it. Came back 2 nights in a row and definitely wil be back for more
1470,9-04-2017 ,5.0,Worth the wait! This place has excellent food and service to boot. No wonder there are always long lines.
1471,9-04-2017 ,5.0,"Everything is super delicious! We've got 4 different tapas, salad and Sangia... amazing! For the desert 3 of us ordered the same coconut cake that was fantastic! Nice friendly stuff. The only thing is that you need to book in advance, because the place is extremely packed!"
1472,8-04-2017 ,5.0,Was told about this place prior to us arriving. Great food and atmosphere. Kid friendly to...Deffinately revisiting before we leave !
1473,7-04-2017 ,4.0,"Torilla de Patata and Brocheta de Langostinos, at noon they serve tapas del dia. Try them all, great place and great food"
1474,7-04-2017 ,5.0,"A wonderful experience on a hot Sunday evening.Great food and a nice wine list. Thriving atmosphere and be prepared to wait, once you have listed. Luckily there are street bars around the corner. Great tapas experience."
1475,6-04-2017 ,5.0,This Tapas restaurant was definitely one of the best places we ate at during our holiday in Spain.Extremely popular with numerous people always waiting for a table !Tapas were excellent and the deserts were equally very good.Service was also very quick and pleasantDining services are also available outside but beware the traffic can be noisy.
1476,5-04-2017 ,5.0,"You must go to this restaurant. The food was great! The sangria was incredible! And the service was exceptional, they really took care of us. We didn't want to leave!!!"
1477,4-04-2017 ,5.0,This is a must try when you are in Barcelona. Beware of the long lines during Spanish time lunch or dinner. Your best bet is to come a bit before Noon for lunch and 8pm for dinner.
1478,4-04-2017 ,5.0,"we were told that this is one of the best tapas restaurants in Barcelona and it is.our hotel was nearby so we saw it at different ours, the place is always packed and the food is excellent. we had dinner, not at traditional Spanish hours (we sat at the table at 19:30).the best time to get a good dinner without having to wait in queue is from 6pm till 7:30pm, after that, there is a queue."
1479,4-04-2017 ,5.0,"We came to the restaurant on a monday evening and found out that we have to wait 40 min for a table. It was so worth it! Wine for the waiting was super cheap and we got our table in exactly 40 min. Service was really nice and attentive. The waiter recommended a few things and we ended up having 4 tapas each (3 normal ones and 1 dessert). Goat cheese with red peppers was amazing! Also the asparragus with mushrooms really took our breath away.When the bill came, the surprise was also really positive. 50 eur for a dinner for two including a bottle of wine."
1480,4-04-2017 ,5.0,My husband and I both find the food are value for the money. The seafood dishes are fresh and delicious compare to other restaurants. We visited twice during our trip.
1481,4-04-2017 ,4.0,"Visited two times - the location is very handy. You have to be prepared to be rushed to order your meal though, but the selection was good... the alcachofas was heavenly! You get the menu opened to the tourist section, but you might take your time to look through the whole selection. Check out the Tapas del dia (specials of the day). I can`t believe I had a glass of Rosè for under 2€ here in the city; not too bad either. There is a huge amount with plates of Tapas on display all the time which makes it easier to pick your favourite nibbles..."
1482,3-04-2017 ,5.0,A cracking Tapas bar with an absolutely delicious and delightful menu of small plates to die for. Go there and enjoy. 
1483,3-04-2017 ,5.0,"The good is off the carts for flavor. The beef and foi gras montadito was one of the best things I've ever consumed. Followed by the shrimp in the olive oil, garlic, and peppers, you have to order some pan to dip into the flavorful oil. While the wait may be a few minutes, the food is worth it. Outside seating is limited, but there is ample space inside. "
1484,2-04-2017 ,5.0,"We've been to Cervecería Catalana on countless occasions. During our last trio to Barcelona we visited it three times, twice for tapas in the evening and once for breakfast. Staff is friendly and attentive, food is top notch and their tapas are our favorite in the Eixample area. Don't leave without having a sangría made of cava, their montaditos of the day (ours was premium tuna, red peppers and anchovies , and it was delicious), bravas, ensaladilla rusa and fried fish with green peppers. Their Iberian ham sandwiches are very pricey but worth every penny. We visited with a baby, they have high chairs but no changing tables, toilets are upstairs. Terrace has heaters. Very comfy with children, though. "
1485,2-04-2017 ,5.0,"Little wait to get a table but worth the visit. The food was perfect and fast, the service was fast. "
1486,31-03-2017 ,5.0,We started and finished our holidays here. We tried several others restaurants in between but glad we went back for a great goodbye. Me my wife and my 3 years boy paid about £50 each time always with a few beers and 5 tapas and all of them were delicious. Pretty crowded but great atmosphere and friendly staff. Muchas gracias 
1487,30-03-2017 ,5.0,"Whenever I am in BCN I am going to this place. It is very lively and the variety of typical Spanish/Catalonian food is excellent, in particular pimientos al patron, alcachovas, Variaciones de balcalhau y mucho mas. Tambien los vinos son bien selecionado."
1488,30-03-2017 ,5.0,Gastronomically delightful. A friend recommended this inner city place. They don't take reservations but if you go before 8pm in Barcelona you're ok usually. Delicious orange juice too
1489,29-03-2017 ,4.0,"This is one of the top places to eat good Spanish tapas in Barcelona. I liked this place better before they changed the furniture, so I rather go to their sister restaurants Ciudad Comtal or Vinnitus. They are top tapas to very good prices."
1490,29-03-2017 ,5.0,Very good tapas. I passed the restaurant for a few days and it is every day a full house.Be early or make a reservation!Very good value for money.
1491,29-03-2017 ,5.0,"You will have the best tapas in Barcelona in this restaurant. The waiters are incredibly helpful with the menu (the daily specials aren't in English), attentive and their service was immaculate. We left at 8:30pm and the queue was out the door, so definitely arrive early. We had our fill, with a litre of sangria for €55, which is extremely reasonable for dinner for two people!"
1492,28-03-2017 ,1.0,"I came here with my sisters based on the great reviews on yelp! The food was great but the service was horrendous. We were served potatas bravas that had a piece of a man's hair stuck on it. We're not that picky so it wasn't a big deal. However, what happened after was pretty upsetting to all of us. The waiter gave us a replacement and after we finished eating the replacement he came back to us and said ""Again, we are so sorry about the hair before. Would you like to have another one?"" He didn't ask us this question for any of the other dishes we had finished or any of the dished we finished after that. He definitely said it as if he was going to give us one on the house because he was apologizing for the hair. We replied with ""Are you sure?"" He said ""Yes"" So we said ""Okay, only if it's okay with you."" We would not have ordered or asked for his permission to order if it wasn't complimentary. Then, we asked him about it after because it said we were charged for two orders of potatas bravas and he said he asked us if we wanted another one and we said yes. He was very rude about it as if we were the ones who were causing a problem. It wasn't a lot of money so we just paid for it but it's the principal of the situation that upset us. After we paid for it, we tried to tell the manager what had happened but he reacted in the same way and even added that we got THREE dishes. It's sad that this is the way we were treated after getting food with hair in it served to us but I guess that's the standard the restaurant has for itself. If that is the standard they are happy with, I'm okay with that! I will enjoy the rest of what Barcelona has to offer :)"
1493,28-03-2017 ,4.0,We went to this on our last day and the food was great. Service was very quick and the restaurant is very popular. Definitely worth a visit. 
1494,28-03-2017 ,5.0,"We popped into this extremely busy restaurant on a Tuesday lunchtime and were very fortunate to get a couple of seats at the bar. This was our first experience of a tapas bar in Barcelona so it was great that the staff were so helpful and attentive. We chose the mixed tapas, to give us a basic grounding in tapas but in truth there were so many dishes that we could, and would have liked to try. In any case what we did have was wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the seafood croquettes and the cuttlefish. This set us up for our visit of the Casa Batllo, which is quite close, and the beginning of a wonderful visit to this fascinating and lovely city."
1495,28-03-2017 ,5.0,"I must start by saying how good the lady at front of house was for this restaurant! This place was super busy and she was incredibly good at her job. Without her i don't think it would have been well oiled like it was.The place was busy, but i can see why now. The food was awesome and the service was great. I loved the hustle and bustle of the evening, it really added to the night. A great evening with great food and drinks x"
1496,27-03-2017 ,2.0,"Our group of 2 was recommended this popular tapas place by our hotel in the neighborhood. It's just too popular, with lines even at 7pm! Was it worth the wait? Quality of tapas - anchovy tempura, garlic prawns, grilled razor clams, pimentos padron, goat cheese on eggplant: average, not up to the reviews, and not worth standing in line. Sangria: disappointing. Desserts: fried bread pudding was creative, crema catalana was just ok. Ambiance: way too cramped. Service: this was the worst part of our experience, with a surly waitress who clearly didn't enjoy her job. Pricing: average. We won't return here. "
1497,27-03-2017 ,5.0,The most delicious tapas. Good cocktails and sangria and wonderful service. I come back every time I'm in Barcelona.
1498,27-03-2017 ,5.0,"This restaurant excells in ambiance, service and of course food.We had tried to get into the restaurant once before but no hope, but persevered the next day and we weren't disappointed. We had a 2 hour slot as even on a Monday lunch they were busy and you can't book a table in advance. The staff were very attentive and guided us through and ordered for us an array of wonderful tapas. Very prompt service too. I'd definitely recommend going if you are in the Rambla de Catalunya area."
1499,27-03-2017 ,5.0,"We love the fact that this place is open through out the day. Even so, it is extremely busy. We first time went there around 7pm and the waiting time for two was about 30 minutes with a long line at the door. Second time was around 4pm and we didn't have to wait for a table. Service was fast and friendly. It serves different daily special menu each day, only in Spanish. The quick and fun way to order is to get the table number from your server and just walk over to the bar area. Whatever looks good to you, you can just ask for your table. I was really impressed with everyone from the cooks behind the bars to the restaurant manager, all very friendly and helpful. We loved everything except the sandwiches. The desserts are excellent too, especially the bread pudding which is to die for. Highly recommend. "
1500,27-03-2017 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is my preferred restaurant in Barcelona. In my visits to this restaurants over the last 3 years, everything I ordered was good. I always order the cod dish, which is delicious. Recently I tried and fell in love with their bread pudding.Although the lines to get a table for dinner are discouraging, it is totally worth the wait. I usually go for lunch, when the restaurant is much less crowded."
1501,26-03-2017 ,4.0,"We really enjoyed having tapas here. Great value, lovely food and good service. It can get busy here, but this is a must in the Passeag De Gracia area."
1502,26-03-2017 ,5.0,We had a very authentic lunch here with an assortment of montatidos. Excellent sangria too. Reasonably priced and of good quality!
1503,26-03-2017 ,5.0,"This is a different type of tapas experience when compared to the smaller informal places that you will find around Barcelona and the food was exceptional. Don't be put off by the fact that it is busy and bustling - they will tell you how long until a table is available and you can wait inside if you wish. We had a table which meant we could take the advice of our waiter and waitress (who were helpful) about which dishes to choose but you can also sit at the bar. Perfectly happy for us to order one or two and then order more. Fiduea (a local paella type dish but with pasta not rice) is also served here and looked amazing. Desserts are also served tapas size and the menu is displayed within a chocolate box. We ate at lunchtime, as did lots of locals, and if we had had the opportunity we would have definitely gone back to eat in the evening."
1504,24-03-2017 ,5.0,"So glad I researched trip advisor for an excellent Tapas Restaurant. You will not be disappointed. Sadly neither of us can speak Spanish, however staff looked after us and we choose with our eyes. Try as many dishes as you can. Very reasonably priced. Delicious tapas bar which I have recommended to many friends already."
1505,23-03-2017 ,5.0,"The wait in line is worth it, the food is fresh and delicious, the staff is attentive and had great recommendations.I would go back again and again."
1506,23-03-2017 ,5.0,"A great place for tapas in Barcelona ! Service is quick and professional. Our waitress was amazing, with really good advices and she even speaks French ;) I recommend it ! "
1507,22-03-2017 ,4.0,"Visited twice.One time sat on a table, second on the bar.Nice beer, very good atmosphere and great tapas."
1508,22-03-2017 ,2.0,"Going to very touristic restaurants should not mean a bad service, and every time I go back to La cerveseria catalana I have the feeling they treat people like animals. We were still on desserts and ordered another bottle of wine, and they kicked us out cause we have been longer than we should, and they had a huge waiting list. The location is very good, but the good is just ok anf it's not worth it the service and the food for the price you pay. I don'ty think I'll be back soon"
1509,22-03-2017 ,4.0,"Arrived Tuesday evening at 7pm. No queue but busy, the service was slick and fast. Great choice of tapas and nice atmosphere. Good value for a very popular place, there was a queue when we left at 8:30pm"
1510,21-03-2017 ,4.0,This restaurant had great food. I just wish I would have been able to understand the menu better. Most of it was in Catalan and the English version didn't really translate it all for us. We basically ordered off of other people's table. But good food none the less. 
1511,21-03-2017 ,4.0,"Very interesting and tasty selection of tapas and larger plates. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The aubergine and miel special was noteworthy. Iberian ham was superb; langoustine likewise. Their desserts deserve special attention, including their unique menu presentation. Come before 8 or be prepared to wait in line on the sidewalk outside. We didn't eat at the bar but the plates of tapas arrayed there looked great."
1512,19-03-2017 ,5.0,"Since I first had lunch at Cerveceria , I have made sure that every time I returned to Barcelona I always have, at least, one meal there.The staffing is nice, but mostly the food is really amazing and they are pretty creative with the tapas. You can eat at a table, at the tapas bar or outside.It is usually pretty full, so I should either make a reservation or show up early (which is what I usually do) - since locals eat a little late, you will probably be able to find a table (without reservation) if you show up a little after 12:00 or around 20:00. They have in the recent years extended the restaurant to the adjacent space (kinf of doubling the space) but still it is regularly full. There is not a lot of free available parking nearby, but you can easily take the subway to Passeig de Grácia and then walk (should be 5-10 minutes walk)."
1513,19-03-2017 ,5.0,we went there in the evening and it was very crowded but there is a waiting list and you can take a drink at the bar waiting to be called by a smiling lady. Big choice of excellent tapas.
1514,18-03-2017 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to me by two friends who lived in Barcelona. It did not disappoint. My partner and I were in Spain for a week and we went to the restaurant twice. Be prepared to wait for 30 minutes to 1 hour (or more if you have lots of people in your party), but it is definitely worth it. Food is affordable, delicious, and great quality. They move very quickly at the restaurant (take orders very fast, so be prepared to know what you want or to slow them down if necessary). "
1515,18-03-2017 ,4.0,Well located and large selection of tapas. Average prices but consistently good food. Loved the fresh marinated shrimps best. Very glad we came 
1516,18-03-2017 ,4.0,Hard to get a spot here. Went by myself to reserve a table for six for a bd and they didn't allow me to sit anywaysWhen we finally sat ordered a few specials and tapas. All delicious
1517,18-03-2017 ,1.0,"Came here based on a personal recommendation from a friend, and after reading reviews, we couldn't wait to try it. It is clearly a popular place. The waitress told us a table would be ready in 20-30 minutes, so we went for a rushed drink only to come back and wait for another 45 minutes. While the waiters were nice, the food was BEYOND AVERAGE. Literally do not understand the hype. The prices are stupid - €5/6 for some green peppers which tasted like oil. The fried artichoke was also overpowered by oil. Everything was totally average and you would literally have to spend 100s of euros to be remotely full up. The tapas didn't feel authentic in any way, both in terms of ingredients, presentation and atmosphere. We were so unimpressed that we left after our first round of tapas and went to eat pizza because we were so hungry! And that bill was already £50! Please do not buy in to these amazing reviews because we were completely underwhelmed"
1518,17-03-2017 ,5.0,We went there with my wife on friday evening so had to wait a while for a table but its worth it. Delicious traditional tapas plus big variety of wines. Very tasty sangria. If you are looking for a place to taste Spanish tapas go there. 
1519,17-03-2017 ,5.0,"Loved this cerveceria so much we ate here twice during our city break. Theres a great atmosphere and the food is so delicious! It gets really busy at dinner time so be prepared to wait, it is definitely worth it though.I would recommend the cabraeos (fries with spicy sauce and fried eggs) OH MY GOD these are the tastiest fries I've ever had. Add a creme brulee for around 2.5 euro and you just cant go wrong."
1520,17-03-2017 ,5.0,This is the most famouse taparia of Barcelona. It's known for the variety of tapas. Probably you will need to wait for a table but it will worth it. 
1521,15-03-2017 ,5.0,Fantastic food atmosphere. Food is fresh and service what you expect from a real spanish cerveseria.
1522,15-03-2017 ,5.0,"This place GETS PACKED! I think we went around 5-6pm on a Friday and the wait for a table was an hour or more. Thank god for the lovely lady working at the bar on the left side of the entrance for gesturing my boyfriend and I to come sit at 2 empty chairs right in front of her! So we technically only waited for 5 minutes. SCORE! This was our first ever meal in Barcelona and we were so excited to try anything and everything!We didn't even look at the menu, the lady at the bar just recommended a whole bunch of stuff that sounded appetizing and since we were hungry we said YES to everything. We had prawns, razor clams, squid, patatas bravas, paella, jamon, and a whole bunch of stuff I don't even remember.... what I do remember is that everything was bomb! (Now I just wanna book a flight to Barcelona just so I can eat razor clams again) Also had their version of sangria (sorry I don't remember the name) and got myself tipsy after 3 glasses. I also love the fact that they had desserts, the chocolate cake was soooo gooood. And I'm very picky when it comes to chocolate cake. Everything was delicious, I don't remember not liking anything (ok maybe this was also because I was starving) but I would go back in a heartbeat :)Sitting at the bar was probably the best because you see all the different tapas and you can just point at stuff you want to order. We actually ate here twice during our 2 day stay in Barcelona. And if time permitted we would have gone a 3rd or 4th time :)"
1523,14-03-2017 ,5.0,"Amazing food amazing atmosphere! The best calamari I have ever had! I recommend the tenderloin, prawn skewers, calamari and the Camembert in particular but all dishes were lovely! Definitely worth the wait! The queues speak for themself! Great food combined with reasonable prices makes this place a go to that you don't want to miss! "
1524,13-03-2017 ,5.0,"Very good, high quality food, good service and nice prices. Staff is very friendly. Nice atmosphere. Every time when we're in Barcelona we pay cerveceria Catalana a visit. "
1525,13-03-2017 ,5.0,"Had dinner here. First clue that it was geared towards tourists was that it was fairly crowded at 19:00. Still, we only waited 5 minutes for a table for 5 but were told by the friendly hostess we had a two hour limit (plenty of time because food was served quickly). Menu came in English except the daily specials. Everything we had was delicious. Beef tenderloin, fried calamari, tomato bread, patatas bravas, all were delicious. Service was quite attentive; plates were swapped out between every few tapas. Dessert menu was really cute, like an elongated box of chocolates with the menu printed on transparent paper and each compartment below having a little origami piece. Chocolate xoxo (like a pastry cream filled churro with warm dark chocolate cream to dip in) was outstanding as was creme brûlée and diced strawberries in OJ and sugar. All in all a fantastic meal. "
1526,13-03-2017 ,3.0,"Prepare for a queue of an hour or more... tapas are OK. Overpriced for sure, nothing particularly special. Very touristy, but people seemed to enjoy it. Better tapas in Madrid. Go to Madrid !!!"
1527,13-03-2017 ,4.0,"Came here with a big group of people, but fortunately we were able to get a table right away without a reservation (which was amazing since they are busy almost every night). They served great tapas and sangria, but I wouldn't say it was the best tapas place in the city. Still great quality, great taste, and a great time! Highly recommend!"
1528,13-03-2017 ,5.0,Great food. We had nice tapas and of great quality. As tapas and good quality food don't expect burger king portions because if you do you are in the incorrect place. I preferred outside and expect to wait around 30 minutes. Out your name inside and outside as there are different lists . 
1529,13-03-2017 ,5.0,"Restaurant fun eating. Excellent cuisine, great atmosphere, reasonable pricing. We sat at the bar and enjoyed every minute"
1530,9-03-2017 ,5.0,"Our first real tapas dinner in Barcelona and it was excellent. Short wait for a table for 4 around 19:00, but well worth it. Recommended dishes include prawns on skewer, garlic shrimp, calamer, Iberian ham plate, chorizo plate, manchego plate, pimientos al padron, asparagus & mushrooms, tomato bread. Some dishes were only on the daily menu like cod with mushrooms & shrimp, very good. We had a local rioja (crianza), also great. Excellent value, ask your server for recommendations from the daily menu, prepare to eat until you burst for less money than you expect."
1531,8-03-2017 ,4.0,"If you wish nice tapas in a nice area, its ideal. But it gets crowded sometimes. Price is not the cheapest but it is worth it. I prefer to sit at the bar rather than a table, its more like the spanish way of tapas."
1532,8-03-2017 ,4.0,"This place gets great reviews and we are not sure it lives up. First, it is really a HOT SPOT. We arrived after the Opera at 11:00 PM and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, but it was a fun place with everyone talking and all the beautiful food coming out of the bustling kitchen. However, the food was just ok. We began to wonder when we saw ""sliders"" on the menu. Really? Sliders for tapas? Maybe that's new but I get that home in the South. Overall an experience, but we probably won't go back."
1533,8-03-2017 ,4.0,Great food and great atmosphere. Very busy would recommend booking a table as the line of people waiting for a table can be crazy waited 45 mins for a table but was worth it and that was on a monday
1534,7-03-2017 ,5.0,My family and I were in Barcelona last week and we tried several tapas restaurants. This one is the only one we ate twice at and that already says it all.We went there for lunch and the wait was reasonable (5 minutes to eat outside and 35 inside). It is not possible to book.While waiting I took pictures of the various delicious tapas that were being served around me and used the pictures later to order. NO I don't speak spanish :-(The service was friendly and efficient although the waiters are under some pressure.All tapas were really delicious and I might fly back to Barcelona just to eat there again.My kids loved the interpretation of french fries with eggs and a sauce to die for. And the best is yet to come : not even 100 euros for that excellent lunch (no wine though) !It's gonna be hard to keep it a secret ;-)
1535,7-03-2017 ,5.0,this tapas joint is so cool you cant make reservations and the lines outside are evidence that this is a hot spot with the most amazing tapas great atmosphere and great service
1536,7-03-2017 ,2.0,"First of all, I would like to mention that I am Spanish. We came to this place as our friends recommended it to us. We arrived quite late, or actually a normal dinner time in Spain, but we had to wait an hour to get a table. So I became excited, that must mean that it is good right? I do understand that it is a fun place to go, full of people, everyone seems happy, you can see food everywhere, a lot of variety and very cheap! When we finally ordered we got our food extremely fast but omg I understand why it is cheap: poor quality :( It is what to expect from a fast food restaurant serving tapas."
1537,6-03-2017 ,5.0,"If you ever wanted to immerse yourself into Barcelona tapas scene, this is the place to go. A wide selection of well portioned tapas and other dishes of amazing quality, efficiently served to a constantly popular restaurant that is buzzing and highly engaging. Its modern, contemporary vibes are complimented by its menu, while its wine list offers excellent value for money. Get there early - it does get busy. One can always reserve a table and have a couple of drinks as they wait (they usually place you in 30 minutes or so)...but for the most enjoyable experience get there earlier and try and get a seta at the food bar by the entrance."
1538,5-03-2017 ,5.0,We had dinner here and arrived at about 7pm and it was packed but we managed to get a table pretty quickly.The food and service was superb so you can't go wrong with this place. We stuffed ourselves with sangria and the bill came to €40 which I thought was great value considering the quality of this place.
1539,5-03-2017 ,4.0,Have been here before with my husband but this time we came with a group of colleagues. The food was as great as ever and there's a great variety of tapas available. We had persons in our party who don't eat red meat or fish and everyone came out full and happy. Highly recommended! 
1540,4-03-2017 ,5.0,"Very nice restaurant, fast service , too many people for the poor waiters who have too much work to focus on you. Vert nice though, service and not too expensive"
1541,4-03-2017 ,5.0,The place is always packed and your way to the bar high seats is a literal war. But the food...oh the food...I could eat there all day.
1542,3-03-2017 ,5.0,"I been there for the first time I find great atmosphere, great staff and great food with great drinks I see all customers are where happy"
1543,3-03-2017 ,5.0,"After searching for a good tapas restaurant for noon, I searched Tripadvisor for one close-by our long walk back to the city centre. I can only agree with the best reviews on the website.This restaurant is GREAT!Every single tapa we ordered was made with great care, good presentation and really tasteful!Luckily we arrived around 1pm to take a last available table outside: perfect location to enjoy to local tapas! If you want to be sure to go, do reserve in advance, this place is crowded!Prices range mid-range to expensive for some, but totally worth it!"
1544,3-03-2017 ,4.0,"The food here is very good, and I have total respect for what the staff has to endure with the crowds and long wait times. (There are no reservations.) I can see how word of mouth might snowball and everyone wants to say they've been here. However, there is so much great food in Barcelona I see no reason to wait 90+ minutes for a table at this specific place. That's time I could have spent exploring and finding new places instead of following the crowd."
1545,3-03-2017 ,5.0,"Recommended to us by our hotel - lines were out the door every night (~20 min wait, but no problem's with a beer/prosecco). all tapas were delicious (especially calamarcitos) and the puddings were great too. recommend Helado de biscuit. Efficient staff - good English."
1546,2-03-2017 ,5.0,"The food was superb! We loved all the food we ordered, especially the steak and foie gras! My daughter loved the mini hot dog. Expect long line, but you don't have to stay and wait. you put down your name and come back within the time frame the receptionist tells you. We went for a drink in near by bar. The total wait time was about 90 mins for us a family of 3."
1547,2-03-2017 ,5.0,"Excellent in every sense, I won't spoil the surprise I can't remember if reservations were possible or not, it's worth the wait anyway, but still try to go as early as you could cause you get stay in its queue for hours and everybody's waiting which tells you that it's an exceptional place."
1548,1-03-2017 ,4.0,"The food is good quality and taste, if you like tapas. You can rely that if you remember a dish you specially liked, the next time you go, it tastes exactly the same. You should ask for the recommendations, specials which are not on the menu. sitting outside is more comfortable, inside it can get pretty hectic and loud, too, the light is too bright and not very cosy inside, and the tables are too close to each other. Prices are ok for what you get. Service, food, wines."
1549,1-03-2017 ,4.0,When in Barcelona you have to try tapas one night. Don't be dissuaded from experiencing this due to a wait for a table or a seat at the bar. It's an experience I'm glad my husband made me wait for. It's good having a diligent husband that was standing near the hostess do she didn't forget us!
1550,1-03-2017 ,5.0,We waited almost an hour but once we were seated each bite we had made us forget the wait - food was incredible. We loved it so much we had to return a second time before we left Spain. My suggestions is to share a little bit of everything and leave room for dessert! The second time we returned we already knew what we loved and doubled up. 
1551,27-02-2017 ,5.0,This was recommended to us and certainly didn't disappoint. We got there early evening and were lucky to get a table - outside under a canopy - with heating.Great selection of tapas and very reasonable.
1552,27-02-2017 ,5.0,"In beautiful surroundings, and with a suitably-gothic vibe, this is a great value find fro veggies and vegans alike."
1553,26-02-2017 ,4.0,Visited this place on recommendation from hotel - what we did not appreciate it is run by the same people as Cuidad Condal and has exactly the same menu!!Although it is larger than Cuidad so easier to get a table stick with Cuidad if you can.
1554,25-02-2017 ,3.0,"Expensive, small portions, depending on your luck smaller or longer queues. The day's choice of tapas is really good, but there are equally good and much cheaper places to eat."
1555,25-02-2017 ,5.0,Great tapas! Excellent quality and variety of many different servings. A bit crowed but definitively the Cerveceria deserves a visit! 
1556,25-02-2017 ,5.0,"The food here is fantastic! I am a foodie. I went to Nacional one night (fabulous ambiance and place) but the food was seriously barely edible (i.e. one cod tapa that was so smelly I had to send it back). Anyhow, we have only wanted to eat here and in another location with either same owners/brothers (Ciudad Condal). Ciudad Condal is on the main drag and even busier. I am not a huge meat person and my daughter hasn't eaten meat in 10 years, but the little hamburger tapas with cheese and caramelized onions were the best burgers I have had in my life...and she ate one! Everything in these places is unbelievable, and I think they have 3 more places in the city as well. They really know how to prepare their food. It is evident that the quality of the ingredients is top notch. We kept going back to repeat so many fabulous tapas. Today we had a cod dish which was so amazing...was loaded with garlic and what seemed to be some sort of raspberry sauce on the side. I can't imagine another tapas place anywhere near this good. (Oh, and we both lived in a Spain too) Oh yeah, and the pricing! It seems like it's an all you can eat and drink place for 30 bucks a head. You keep ordering and drinking, and then when you get your bill...you are even happier!"
1557,24-02-2017 ,2.0,"I am generally unsure why this restaurant is so popular considering what amazing tapas places there are in Barcelona. I visited this restaurant with my partner just last week and it was disappointing. We were happy to get a table as we were told that it is almost impossible without waiting for at least an hour. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. We ordered a handful of tapas dishes and some dessert. The food was completely average, but I did think the Sangria was very nice."
1558,23-02-2017 ,4.0,"This is a very touristic place , the food is correct and also what you pay for it , aervice is good and they hire disable people what makes it even better . "
1559,23-02-2017 ,5.0,"we got a recommendation for this restaurant from some mates back home when they saw that we were in Barça, we rocked up about 7:30-8 and it was rammed. queueing out of the door, we stuck with it because of the recommendation and we got to the hostess within 5-10 minutes.. she told us we could have a table in approx 25 mins so we went over the road for a beer, there is a bar there but as I said it was very busy.. when we got back we were escorted to a table in the rear of the restaurant, which is pretty big.. the staff were great, the tapas were gorgeous, we loved it...."
1560,22-02-2017 ,5.0,"A fabulous place and a real experience. Take the waiter's advice and surprise yourself with some really different dishes. Get there early as the wait can be long. At 630 we waited 5 mins, but there's often a 2 hr wait at 8pm. "
1561,22-02-2017 ,5.0,A fabulous selection of tapas - some local specialities as well as the usuals. Fab prawns - nice veggie selection but not that many. Really helpful staff. Gets very very busy so arrive early.
1562,21-02-2017 ,5.0,"Delicious!!! Big menu with so much to choose from - we ordered a lot of plates. The tenderloin with foie, Iberian ham plate, shrimp skewers, and clam special were my favorites. You can eat at the bar or at indoor and outdoor tables. At 8, there was already a wait for a table for 2, so go a little early. "
1563,21-02-2017 ,5.0,"This is a must go. Yes it is very crowded and yes it may seem too touristic, however, once you have a table and start getting served, you understand why so many, even locals, will want to come and enjoy the food here. Tasty, authentic, creative! And good price value. Around 17:00 we had no wait and a good table immediately. So yes, choose the right time!"
1564,21-02-2017 ,5.0,I love all the tapas dishes that I had here! A lot of locals eat here so the food is very authentic and traditional.
1565,21-02-2017 ,5.0,Ate twice here during our stay in Barcelona.Super coffee and tasty breakfast Tapas!Friendly and helpful staff.Nice quiet part of town and relaxing.
1566,19-02-2017 ,4.0,"we didn't book in advance and there was a bit of a queue when we got there around 1, and it took about 30 minutes to get a seat. the food was nice, though some of it could have used some salt/ lemon juice. The service was good."
1567,18-02-2017 ,5.0,"We had breakfast here every morning of our stay. Delicious coffee, Madeleines and flautas kept us going until lunch. The orange juice is freshly squeezed. We didn't try the beer but even in the morning it seemed popular!"
1568,18-02-2017 ,5.0,"This is the first name that would come up if you search tapas bar on tripadvisor, yelp, etc. so it gotta be good.It happened that it was just down the block from our hotel so of course we had to try it once we arrived Barcelona. There's always a line. We came at 7pm and luckily there were 2 spots at the bat that we could took immediately. Food was really fresh and they got lots of options. I wouldn't say the food was cheap but definitely worth what you paid for."
1569,17-02-2017 ,5.0,"Cervecería catalana is amazing! Besides the local brewed beer, they have a great (and delicius) variety of tapas! I recommend the huevos cabreados y los quesos con marmelada de fresa. Perfect!!"
1570,17-02-2017 ,4.0,"Whilst Cerveceria Catalana did not blow me away, I would definitely recommend this place for what it is. The food is good authentic tapas, and the prices are great, definitely nothing to grumble about there. The service however is quite rushed and not in the slightest bit personable. I think we arrived during their peak time (around 8pm) as we had a 2 hour wait for a table, they originally said 1.5 hours when we first arrived. So we popped round the corner for a drink as the place was heaving both inside and out, I would definitely recommend doing this. The ""Crema Catalana"" was amazing!"
1571,16-02-2017 ,4.0,"I went there for early dinner, but there were already crowded. Staffs were very friendly. Food was delicious. Atmosphere as great. You can ejoy even alone."
1572,15-02-2017 ,5.0,The Tapas dishes were delisious and the service personal and professional. Good atmoshphere and good memories
1573,15-02-2017 ,5.0,"Visited this restaurant last week and would highly recommend it. We ordered a mixture of tapas ranging from calamares, pulpo a la gallega, patatas bravas and croquetas de jamon. I could have ate 20 of the croquetes alone , they were delicious :)Overall: Fresh authentic spanish food. What more can you ask for!"
1574,15-02-2017 ,5.0,"Perfect place for: Lovers of fresh seafood (squid, shellfish) and tapas. Not annoyed by having to wait in a likely noisy and crowded environment, all for great food.Price Point: Not a cheap eat place. Reasonably priced for the quality of food and cooking. Environment: Bar area - first come first serve, more crowded & can be chaotic. Restaurant - nicely decorated, tables close together. May not be able to “hang around” once done eating but waiters are courteous and not too pushy in getting you out. Note: We went at around 2:45pm and had a wait of around 15 mins."
1575,14-02-2017 ,5.0,Stopped here at 1900 on a Tuesday. I was seated immediately and able to choose my tapas fresh. They were the best I had in Barcelona and the sangria was delicious!
1576,14-02-2017 ,4.0,"Always the best Tapas in Barcelona, always the biggest variety of Tapas, but always crowded with many tourists, always to wait in line. Make your own decision: to be or not to be."
1577,13-02-2017 ,5.0,Always busy but worth going to. Bar counters at the entrance are a good spot to be for fast service. Daniel (one of the Dannys) is exceptional and will make sure you have a good time. i think everyone speaks english so easy to order food and drinks. You can order drinks from the bar while you wait. Try the vermouth.
1578,13-02-2017 ,5.0,This was recommended to us and it did not disappoint. Our first go at tapas and we loved it- food really fresh. By the time we left they were queuing to get in. Ordered too much as we didn't know how big the portions were. Deserts were delicious.
1579,13-02-2017 ,5.0,"Simply excellent place to eat tapas. The food was very tasty and fresh, service is just right and very helpful. The only problem is that it is full all the time (which us understandable:-)) "
1580,13-02-2017 ,5.0,"Truly amazing tapas bar, a must visit if you are in Barcelona, menu is brilliant, service is great, we visited on an afternoon and people were queuing for seats tourists and locals which I believe speaks volumes for a establishment. Just a leisurely walk to the top end of Las Ramblas. Will definitely visit again when back in Barcelona."
1581,13-02-2017 ,5.0,Agree with most other reviews that the food here is very good with competent service. Be warned that it gets very busy and as tables cannot be booked waiting is inevitable. We waited for 40 mins on a Friday evening ( from a relatively early 8pm). The system for reserving your position in the queue works well and so we were able to go for a drink elsewhere and return in time to be called to our table. As long as you are prepared to do this the wait is well worthwhile as the food is excellent.
1582,12-02-2017 ,4.0,"Very good and fresh tapas. Great athmosphere and fast service. Walking from Sagra Familia, looked up this place by recommendations. It was worth it."
1583,10-02-2017 ,4.0,Nice tapas. Good place for breakfast and a beer before lunch. Close to paseo gracia and ramblas. Good terrace 
1584,10-02-2017 ,5.0,"Food was good and service was quick. We came around 1PM when the lines were still short. The open sandwiches, which you could choose from the counter, were really good."
1585,8-02-2017 ,4.0,"A good restaurant for ""tapeo"" and a cup of good wine.Prices are towards the high, but the quality of food is adecuate."
1586,8-02-2017 ,5.0,"Classic place to take somebody who just arrived to Barcelona, they serve all the classic catalan plates and they are very good!"
1587,8-02-2017 ,5.0,"Everything is great! The food, the service, the atmosphere. Very vibrand restaurant where you can taste excellent tapas!"
1588,7-02-2017 ,5.0,"One of the best things of this place is the atmosphere, there's a mixture between Catalan people and tourists, it's worth going there at any tine, having breakfast is great, the daily sandwiches are difficult to find anywhere else, having a quick & healthy lunch at the bar is highly recommended, especially if you go alone because you are likely to meet someone, and if you have dinner in the restaurant, the menu is the same as in the bar and you are going to enjoy it !!! The only negative point are the queues to take a seat especially at certain times.... I love this place... and now you have a new and better restaurant called Vinitus....don't miss it!!!"
1589,6-02-2017 ,5.0,"Fabulous selection of tapas, reasonably priced. A busy restaurant had a short wait, but sat at the bar until a table was ready. We had a variety of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes, however the chocolate dessert with olive oil toast was really pleasant surprise.This was our second visit and will return again!"
1590,4-02-2017 ,5.0,"We were traveling with our kids and they are not adventurous when regarding food... but this was a great choice because there were options for them and for us adults... I specially recommend the shrimp skewer and the Brie with berry jam. Make sure you save some space for dessert... they are also WONDERFUL!!! They are not big, so I suggest you order more than one, to try different ones... There were four of us and we ordered 5 different desserts and then 2 more of our favorite ones (so 7 desserts in all)."
1591,4-02-2017 ,4.0,"Everything about this place oozes culture! Its great to experience this kind of dining when in Barcelona, the place is classy, the food is tasty, good for couple of big groups! JUST GO, TRUST ME!"
1592,4-02-2017 ,5.0,Excellent service! love this place ant their waitress are so friendly with the customers :) They helped us with all doubts. 
1593,3-02-2017 ,4.0,Well excecuted tapas in a classy upmarket feel setting. No reservations so prepare for a long wait at peak times. Staff at front of house taking down names for waitlist not friendly w a bit of an attitude. Waiter was helpful in translating the daily specials. Try the grilled spring onions w a delicious nutty tomato dip (seasonal specials!). Desserts (esp the carrot cake) are worth the extra calories too!
1594,2-02-2017 ,4.0,"A very busy place with many efficient waiters/waitresses, so no delay in getting served.A good range of tasty tapas dishes on offer.Worth a visit"
1595,1-02-2017 ,3.0,"This place had been recommended to us as ""the best tapas in Barcelona"" and we were advised that we would probably have to wait for a while to get a table. We walked in and were seated pretty much straight away. The waiter who served us was very helpful and translated those items on the menu I could not understand.The food was average, nothing special. Sangria was weak and watery. All in all, a bit of a disappointment, we found much better places which were considerably cheaper."
1596,31-01-2017 ,4.0,"If you are looking for some tasty local food with a local atmosphere, go there. We visited twice in one city trip doesn't that say it all ? Fresh food, max 15 minute wait before you get a table, friendly staff and fair prices. pika pika njam njam :) !"
1597,31-01-2017 ,5.0,This restaurant is fantastic. Definitely the place to go to get tapas while in Barcelona. There is a huge variety and great drinks! Make a reservation because thing place gets busy for dinner. Definitely worth the wait. 
1598,31-01-2017 ,5.0,"You know this place is good when even the locals bother to queue up for a table even at 10pm. Our first meal in Barcelona and we absolutely love it. Staffs were okay but professional. Seafood tapas was fresh, the rest of the was fantastic at a reasonable price as well. Highly recommend to this restaurant if you are in Barcelona"
1599,30-01-2017 ,5.0,"one of the best places that i had lunch.great food great service and fast.we didnt make reservation but find place to seat directly.we had prawns sticks calamares fried,croquettes and tapas with oil and tomatoes and 2 glasses of wine and for dessert,ice cream with waffles and.....an orgasming crem with bread.dont know the name...i remember tha taste....the best dessert in spain!just try it!we paid just for 33 euros.i loved the prawns.i say prawns and have the taste in my mouth!!everything was excellent"
1600,30-01-2017 ,4.0,Was there for lunch and their cod is amazing and the mushroom mix was also great. The mushroom ham risotto is also very good. The octopus is so so.
1601,28-01-2017 ,5.0,"One of the best Tapas restaurant in Barcelona. But it takes some time to come in, for normal you need 1 hour or more if you have not reservate. Nevertheless the food is unbelievable delicious, really fresh and it takes no longer then 15min before you get the first pieces. The prices are ok for the quality you receive. Highly recommended. "
1602,27-01-2017 ,5.0,"Popular tapas restaurant amongst the locals and visitors. Really fresh seafood, cooked to perfection. Good wine selection to boot. "
1603,25-01-2017 ,4.0,"Little to find fault here. You may have to wait a while if you want to sit at the bar.

1605,22-01-2017 ,5.0,"Our friends living in Barcelona took me and my wife for dinner in this wonderful place. Ambiance is very nice, very cozy and perfectly designed. Food was amazing! We tried many different tapas, one better than the other! I recommend Pulpo a la Galiciana! Enjoy! "
1606,22-01-2017 ,5.0,"We were staying a 5 minute walk away from this very popular tapas restaurant and tried twice to eat there at 7:30pm but the wait was 1.5 hours+. So, we came earlier (6:45pm) and got seated in less than 30 minutes (a Wednesday night). The hostess told us that they are busy from 7:30pm til 12MN every day 7 days/week (no reservations accepted--you have to put your name on the wait list when you get there). The food was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed all of our plates with a pitcher of red wine sangria. Highlights: Iberian Jabugo ham, tomato toast, fried green peppers, razor clams, prawns in garlic sauce, lightly fried calamari, pulpos (octopus), asparagus & grilled assorted mushrooms. High quality tapas for the price. We were in Barcelona for 6 nights (November 2016) in the Eixample area and this was one of the best tapas places."
1607,22-01-2017 ,5.0,"If you are in Barcelona you should visit this perfect place. Waitress are so nice- food is so delicious!!! Try baked camber with sweet jam - it's paradise, small calmari and mix tapas. The prices are not cheap, but fine. Perfect place to have drinks. It's nice to sit near the bar ich have not big company with u. "
1608,20-01-2017 ,5.0,Really amazing place with amazing food amazing stuff and great concept .I recommend to sit on the bar and experience the taste and art of food in front of u
1609,19-01-2017 ,4.0,"Great Tapas, but pricey but quick service before going to Gaudi's Casa Batlló 10 minutes away.Garlic prawns and Iberian ham were good!"
1610,19-01-2017 ,4.0,Visited here twice and do not regret either visit both times the restaurant was full but the service was faultless and the food excellent the waiter Reul expertly guided us through the mysteries of tapas to first time visitors to Barcelona
1611,19-01-2017 ,3.0,"We went there around 9pm in night, it was super busy, loads of people waiting for table. We were lucky, just 20 mins waiting. The tapas is okay not the best one in Barcelona. A little expensive. "
1612,18-01-2017 ,3.0,"Simply average, its a great spot to get introduced to the Tapas scene in barcelona. Nice little spot to have your first meal in Barcelona and meet the famous Place. From here thou. Start venturing into the city and finding great spots to eat better and better tapasHave the Patatas Bravas, must have the huevos estrellados and have some of the bite size bocatas. Enjoy a nice Caña or a nice House wine and start your dream trip in Barcelona"
1613,17-01-2017 ,5.0,This place has a very nice selection of tapas . The tapas are awesome . The service is very good and fast. The place gets crowded with locals . The prices are a litle higher but this area is higher end and not so crowded as the Ramblas. It is not a tourist trap.
1614,17-01-2017 ,5.0,"Best tapas place in town. The prices are a little bit high but the quality is high as well. They don't take reservation but be there around 7pm easy to find place. If it is full, give your name and wait, it definitely worths. Suggest to visit and have nice dinner."
1615,17-01-2017 ,5.0,"In the beautiful area of gracia is this beautiful place. No reservation. No safe tables. With a big amount of luck we got a table for 9 in this amazing restaurant. Even if it was crowded, we felt super comfortable. We started with excellent wine followed by these incredible delicious tapas- It made me speechless!!! - mini Burgers. Fried fish. Vale Filet. Green Peppers. Pulpo.... We tried it all. The cutest thing in the end was the desert card. YOU HAVE TO GO THERE!!!!!"
1616,17-01-2017 ,5.0,"This is a good, traditional Spanish tapas bar. Food is lovely and just off the top of Las Ramblas. An ideal spot to get some refreshments and watch the world go by."
1617,17-01-2017 ,5.0,"The place might look super crowded from outside (maybe it is) but hop in and ask for a table. There is plenty of space inside so the queue may not be long. And the wait is worth it! Have a look at the bar to have an idea of the bocadillos (small sandwiches) and tapas they have. They look and taste great! The sangria is good way to spend time while waiting. I recommend the sirloin bocadillo, it's just amazing. They speak good English so don't worry if your Spanish is rusty. "
1618,17-01-2017 ,4.0,"I went alone to Barcelona, staying at Eixample. I wanted to try tapas and tue hotel host recommend me this one, and the experience was amazing, must try the huevos cabreados and montaditos de lomo. Prices are fair. Is very concurred so probably you have to wait to be seated"
1619,16-01-2017 ,5.0,Fantastic food - great atmosphere - authentic Spanish tapas with excellent service. In the center of Barcelona so it gets busy but you can reserve 
1620,16-01-2017 ,5.0,Visited this restaurant three times on my recent visit to Barcelona. The place is always busy and the tapas and desert are great. To avoid the queues I recommend getting there before traditional Spanish Lunch and Dinner times.
1621,16-01-2017 ,3.0,"good service, nice place. but ordinary food, bad beer.i will not suggest anyone to try. there are hundreds of placas with the same quality in barcelona."
1622,15-01-2017 ,5.0,"3 of us called into this fantastic tapas bar on a busy Friday evening. The restaurant was very busy, filled with locals and tourists alike. Grab a seat at the bar and reserve a table, so you can enjoy a drink and a nibble whilst you wait. The Tapas were so tasty that all 3 of us were delighted we had persevered upon seeing how busy this place was. We enjoyed a selection of excellently prepared and presented Tapas, drinks and a very reasonable bill. "
1623,14-01-2017 ,5.0,"Finally a place worth 5 stars. We went there several times during our stay, and it was perfect every time. We where sitting at the bar, with the food right in front of us. The waiters are friendly, whatever you order arrives almost immediately. Everything is fresh and tasty. And the best thing is: for the quality you get this place is ridiculously cheap!A most go."
1624,13-01-2017 ,5.0,Had dinner there. Tapas. Fantastic authentic and really tasty food. Great portions with a wide variety . Prawns and Razor Clams were awesome . Exactly what we were looking for. Wines are well selected and inexpensive. Overall a really great night out with children and relatively inexpensive 130 Euro incl wine. Totally recommend this experience. Arrive early before 8 pm as we came the night before at 9:30 and the wait for a table was 90 min.
1625,13-01-2017 ,2.0,"You can choose among a wide variety of tapas, there are hot tapas on the other side of the bar.Excelent to go with friends and have a few tapas with a glass of wine or a beer.At certain times it is very crowded and it is difficult to find a place"
1626,13-01-2017 ,3.0,"We went here to eat tapas recommended by friends and we had seen good reviews online. The waiters were not friendly, everything is rushed and the environment is Crowded and noisy. The food is expensive for the quality served. Would not recommend or come back."
1627,13-01-2017 ,2.0,"We were pretty disappointed by the food (all the fish we ordered was frozen). The level of service is low, it seems to be in a fast food with people called on the microphone."
1628,13-01-2017 ,5.0,"This is an awesome restaurant with contemporary setting. The ambiance is nice and the staff efficient and polite. The tapas are fantastic and delicious. They are different from other tapas bars that we have tried. The restaurant is constantly crowded. We have to wait for more than 45 minutes to get a table. But the wait is worth for the tapas and the service more than made up for it. When you get to the restaurant and you can't a place at the bar, leave your name with the staff. They will then reserve a table for you."
1629,12-01-2017 ,4.0,A friend who studied in Spain recommended this place. Lots of choices to choose. Super delicious. Not that expensive i think compared to those around Rambla. Would definitely go back!!
1630,12-01-2017 ,4.0,"As everybody mentions in their reviews, it is always busy and they don't take reservations. That said, you should be able to get a table within 20 minutes, you leave your name and you stroll around until it is time.....nice city to do so by the way.Servers are super fast and knowledgeable, and very friendly. The food is excellent you just have to make sure you understand what you are asking for, hence the value of a good server."
1631,12-01-2017 ,4.0,"We visited this Tapas Bar in January 2017, our comments -Plus# Freshly made tapas (small finger food made of meat, veg or fish) served to you on the table.# Even though we did not put our name at the entrance, the staff gave us a table because we were traveling with an infant and a toddler (big thanks).# service is quick and staff speaks English, and explains everything quite well.# Prices are affordable and compared to other Tapas restaurants spread across the city, it is a good value for money.# The restaurant is lively and full of people all the time. We went around 5 pm.# Delicious tomato breadMinus# No high chairs were available for kids.# Toilets are upstairs, and could be maintained better. Surprisingly there are no male urinals, only 2 toilet seats are there."
1632,11-01-2017 ,4.0,"Got there at 7pm and got a seat right away at the tapas bar (which is a great place to eat btw since you can order directly with the guy and the food comes out super fast). Most of the dishes were delicious with a few misses here and there.The good:*Bread pudding: just get it. Seriously.* Grilled cuttlefish* Razor clamsThe okay:Scallops that was served on a seashell: flavor was goodWasn't a fan of the mixed seafood with mushrooms (wish I ordered the clams instead)Overall, reasonable prices, friendly service and good food. Recommended.When I was leaving around 7:45/8, the place was packed and there was an hour wait for a table. So get there earlier if you can and sit at the bar!"
1633,11-01-2017 ,5.0,Crowded. Got a seat at the bar immediately. If you want tapas without sacrificing quality then this is the place
1634,10-01-2017 ,5.0,"A very busy restaurant with very good food. It is very popular and crowded so it might take some time to get a table, but its worth the waiting."
1635,10-01-2017 ,5.0,"Delicious tapas. Great service. Was told we would have to wait 15 mins, instead waiting 2 mins. Staff are very friendly and happy to help you choose what you select from tapas menu. "
1636,8-01-2017 ,4.0,The food was ok but the whole dinner for 5 persons took less then 50 minutes.The first dishes came 2 minutes after our order. So if you are in a hurry it is a ok place.It is a pity that the waitresses was stressed and did not make us feel very welcomed.
1637,8-01-2017 ,5.0,"Short story: this place is very packed with very few Spanish people, but the food, bar, and service are excellent. Long story: It's no mystery that Barcelona is all about the food. It's also no mystery that the unspoken sport of Barcelona is to find the hidden gems if gastronomic wonder. In that light, many people look down upon the famous and packed establishments like Cervecería Catalana as being too cliche or too popular and well-trodden by tourists. This is a horrible mistake in this case.True that nearly none of the clientele are Spanish, and true that nearly none of the wait staff is either. But it is also true that the service is great, attentive and accurate. Additionally, the food is excellent. My only complaint is that they don't always have the honey bacalao, but that only testifies to the freshness of their fare. Their patatas are incredible, as is the eggplant. The tables are expected to turn quickly, however, so don't come expecting a long sobremesa. Some find this rude, but if you want a great meal done relatively quickly (an American pace) this is the place."
1638,8-01-2017 ,5.0,"This is one of the most famous locations in this part of town and it is always crowded during locals meal time and turists meal time. No reservation. Order slow, don't all at once so you can better appreciate the ambiance and the food"
1639,7-01-2017 ,5.0,We were recommended this place by a local - best tapas ever! Perfect way to spend dinner on NYE 2016.
1640,4-01-2017 ,4.0,"This place is fantastic and has amazing tapas food and environment. It felt festive, vibrant and very local. The portions are smaller than you think so order more than you realize. The wait can be long so though so get there early as they don’t take reservations. If you're dying to try something upscale tapas, this is the place."
1641,4-01-2017 ,4.0,Tapas and sangria here are just amazing! The place is nice but very crowded. i Would advise this restaurant 
1642,4-01-2017 ,5.0,"Placed downtown Barcelona, close to Passeig de Gracia metro station and a few steps away from Rambla de Catalunya, Cerveceria Catalana is one of the eateries you have to enjoy once in Barcelona. It is a must do & a must eat :-) Tourists and Barcelona residents come here alike; the place is pretty almost crowded - during luch and dinner peak hours (around 2 pm and 7-8 pm) be prepared to wait up to 40 min. (I understand it is the same for breakfast, in between 8 - 10 am). Waiting shouldn't be a problem, as this is also part of the Spanish culture and eating experience: relax, grab a beer, a glass of wine or sangria and wait at the bar, socialize, grab some small tapas to go with the drink (like olives, for example). The restaurant serves a vast selection of quality tapas, the fish and seafood is always fresh, they have a large variety of beer brands and one of the best sangria in town. In a nutshell, the food is delicious and savoury!The staff speaks English and it is politie and pleasant. The service is quite quick. The restaurant is quite large, although this is not obvious from the entrance; it also has a terrace. If you need an extra quality reference, the restaurant is included in the Michelin quide. Even if the prices are not exactly low, the rate price quality is very good. Opening hours: weekdays 8 am - 1:30 am / weekend 9 am - 1:30 am. The restaurant does not take reservations."
1643,4-01-2017 ,5.0,"Firstly, this place doesn't take reservations, so try and pitch up at around 8pm. The ambience is fantastic, with people queuing up and others sitting at the bar, with tapas on display. The food itself was just fantastic, from the peppers to the sirloin sandwich, I could not fault this place. An absolutely fantastic establishment, with really tasty food!"
1644,4-01-2017 ,3.0,"same tapas at every restaurant. Any tapas worth to wait for 90 min. I chose other restorants without queue up. There is no difference..Especially i can't understand romantic couples that drink slowly their wines. Because, so many people are watching their bites and sips around the table..you have to hurry, they want to sit and eat after you stand up."
1645,3-01-2017 ,5.0,This restaurant adds a new dimension to what tapas are all about. I am not going to go into the details of what we had...enough to tell you that each of the four items we shared was a delight to the palate and to the eyes. And the cost is unbelievably reasonable!Now the one caveat. Be prepared for a healthy wait. No reservations are taken and this is a hot place for the locals. We hung around the bar and we're able to get 2 seats way before our name came up for a table. Could not have made a better choice to see all the action at this great restaurant.
1646,3-01-2017 ,5.0,"the place is amazing! Always crowded, you will definitely never get a seat when you walk in, but the waiting is worth it every ingle time! I have been here more than 10 times and it has NEVER ever disaapointed me! Better if you come in groups! So you can order lots of things and share them! The rpices are grea!!! If yo uare in BCN, you canot leave the the city without going here! Authentic catalan spanish food !!"
1647,3-01-2017 ,5.0,"From 8 in the morning till late at night any time is good to enjoy gorgeous plates.I suggest you to ask for the "" Tapa del día"", a list of goodies they refresh every day.The "" huevos cabreados "" or the sardines are my favourites. All the staff speak good english. No reservations. Be ready to wait if you show up around 2 or 8 p.m."
1648,3-01-2017 ,5.0,"This place is amazing. We were a group of 8 and were seated immediately ( but the waiting time for 1 person before us was around 40 minutes so it is better to book a table before) The Place is buzzing with people, as you enter you can already see the fresh seefood at the entrance and know that it is going to be a good dining experience. The food was amazing (ordered some mixed tapas plates) but the desert was the best part. I never had this good of a desert before. Will visit again if we are in Barcelona."
1649,2-01-2017 ,5.0,Great spot for dinner just off Passeig de Gracia and near some of Gaudí's impressive buildings! Their huevos cabreaos were one of the many dishes I really enjoyed.
1650,2-01-2017 ,5.0,"One of the best restaurants that we visited in Barcelona,great food, wonderful service!!!!We tried many dishes and all of them were incredible.However the restaurant was crowded, we didn't feel it because is very spacious.Definitly we will go back in our future visit to Barcelona!!!"
1651,2-01-2017 ,5.0,This place is amazing. Every single tapas we tried was outstanding. It is very crowded and we had to wait for like 20 min but it worth it. 
1652,2-01-2017 ,5.0,"This place was recommended to us by a taxi driver on the way from the airport as the best place to eat in Barcelona. The problem is that he must have told others because the place was packed and it isn't possible to book ahead. There were big queues the first time we went but it was well worth the wait, and we've been back another three times. It really is extremely good indeed. My wife loves seafood and regards this as the best place she's been to in Barcelona. The atmosphere is great too, thanks to the benches that tend to be conducive to chatting with your neighbours at the next table. A very cosmopolitan clientele: French, Japanese, American: we have annoyed them all by interrupting their lunches. But great fun and the service is brilliant."
1653,1-01-2017 ,5.0,"Every single tapa we tried was outstanding, some of the best in Barcelona. The specials for that day, which included creamy seasonal mushrooms and thinly sliced artichoke, were fantastic, as were the gambas from their regular menu and the croquetas.Although the place was crowded, we received prompt and personal service. Don't miss this place, if you can find a table!"
1654,31-12-2016 ,5.0,"this tapas bar has been around and it is still wonderful. try the seafood bar and order what you see and like. the camembert skewer is different and good. the chipirones or small squids are amazing and so are all mushroom, asparagus and pimientos dishes. do not forget to keep some space for the delicious strawberries served with orange juice or the tarta de whisky a real treat. then finish with a shot of hierbas served frozen to digest the feast."
1655,30-12-2016 ,5.0,"When we arrived there for lunch at 2pm, there was a huge crowd. We nearly decided to leave after we learned that we might have to wait 45 mins to be seated. However, the restaurant is big and we only waited for 15-20 mins. Everything including the dessert was amazing, really nice tapas place, a must go in Barcelona! "
1656,30-12-2016 ,5.0,Classic tapas place with good food and reasonable house beer. Would order tapas one by one instead of getting the mixed plate. Quality was high and service was prompt. We went mid afternoon toward the end of the lunch period (around 15:00) not too busy. When we walked by late a night it was very crowded.
1657,30-12-2016 ,5.0,Tasty tapas and great selections. Price is reasonable. Avoid dinner hour u can avoid to queue. Good Wine selection available 
1658,29-12-2016 ,5.0,"This is one of the best tapas bars in the center of Barcelona. Nice atmosphere, various typical Spanish food. Always full, and does not take reservations."
1659,28-12-2016 ,3.0,"After hearing multiple praises regarding this place, I must say that I was pretty disappointed.The service is non existent, they couldn't care less about you. You can't reserve so We waited in line for for 20 min. I didn't mind the waiting yet the food wasn't exciting/special/ creative more than any other average place in Barcelona. And when comparing to the amaizing places that this city has to offer - I would recommend going elsewhere.."
1660,28-12-2016 ,5.0,"I ate here my first night in Barcelona when I had no idea what I was doing. It may have been a little touristy but it was a great way to get into the flow of Barcelona. The restaurant was packed and the waitlist long but we grabbed two seats at the bar and ate there. The food was delicious and the sangria was really good. The place was lively, making dinner fun."
1661,28-12-2016 ,4.0,"Great Location, ideal for breakfast if you're into tapas style + coffee morningsWhenever I'm in Barcelona I visit the place, and it has always been a delightful place to spend your morning in"
1662,26-12-2016 ,5.0,"Great food, excellent service and generally good value for Barcelona. Always one of my favourites to take visitors to in Barceloneta to give them an all around good mix of Spanish dishes. Long queues so don't come between 8.30-10.30 unless you are prepared to wait for at least 30 min (while enjoying beer and wine)."
1663,26-12-2016 ,1.0,Today 26.12.2016 after visiting La Sagrada Familia we decided to have lunch in this place. At the end I asked the bill and the waiter cheated us in the receipt for 1fanta and 200ml beer cost us €10. The bill was €30.25 I gave him €40 and he didn't wanted to give me back the rest ot the money explaining that they are for the Service hi provided. Chips were not fresh. The other waiters obviously are in a clan together cause they tried to send us away and defending that waiter who was trying to steal €10 from us and they tried to hide the bill. Finaly we got the rest of the money but we have to see their grumpy and angry faces and gestures. Theives.
1664,26-12-2016 ,4.0,"Even though the place was packed, we were able to get a seating around 9.. Tapas arrived quick - even though it took us a long time to select the tapas from the long list - better have pictures next to the tapas.. Price paid compared to what we have eaten is well worth satisfactory.. Definitely recommend.."
1665,24-12-2016 ,2.0,"Cerveceria Catalana falls flat from its hype. We have had far better tapas in Barcelona. Cerveceria is over crowded, the ambiance is dull after you pass the store front and go to the seated area, the staff act like paid employees without passion for food or their clientele, and the tapas was ordinary - we had 6 different dishes and 5 were ordinary. The bread with tomatoes was the worst we've had in Barcelona. We will never go back and certainly tell people to avoid Cerveceria"
1666,23-12-2016 ,5.0,I have been many times. I always liked it but my last visit made me like the place more and will continue to support the restaurant. There are many good places to eat in Barcelona. Why do i like it more. I saw a Down Syndrome's woman working there. She was polite and kind bringing out the food and cleaning the tables. I applause the restaurant for employing challenging human beings. I hope this post will encourage the owner to hire more. Now the food was consistent. It was always crowded after 20:00. My advice is go there for lunch or a know early dinner but there will be limited ready to eat tapas. You can always order them.
1667,22-12-2016 ,5.0,"First time here, and wow what a find, very local to our hotel at H10 Cassanova. The atmosphere was great and we eat on the terrace, great menu and value. The Gambas and Seafood were fresh and great quality JUST fabulous, alongside other Tapas on the menu, the green peppers wow ....spicy > we came here twice during our staff as great value and free wine with the Tapas even better and great tasting wine too.We will deffo be returning in January.Staff are great and attentive. Surely is a must visit!"
1668,21-12-2016 ,5.0,"Try the aspargus and mushrooms or the burrata, they´re delicious! It´s always full, but you can quickly sit on the balcons if you don´t wanna wait for a table."
1669,21-12-2016 ,5.0,"Of all the restaurants we have visited anywhere in Europe, the service of this place outweighed everyone. Most courteous staff and well served food and the best part was that not just one or two, all of them. We ordered the tapas and they recommended the dessert which was one of the best bread puddings I have had. We had creme brûlée as well and loved it too. Definitely a marvellous experience!!! "
1670,20-12-2016 ,4.0,Really nice place where you can have a quick tapas with a beer or a complete dinner with great wine. Of course the dinner is composed by taps as and ponchos. Staff is very efficient. Price in my opinion is very good considering the high quality of the food. 
1671,20-12-2016 ,5.0,Amazing fresh food... Brilliant Tapas... Went here twice in 3 nights... Would definitely go back again... Long queue but worth the wait...
1672,20-12-2016 ,4.0,His restaurant was recommended by our receptionist and it was surprisingly amazing. Tapas was amazing and the waiters are attentive. 
1673,20-12-2016 ,5.0,"Came here after reading all the great reviews and boy we were not disappointed! All the food was fresh and tasty and all the staff were polite and spoke English, and they also have English menus too. You will find that there are a lot of tourists here, that didn't bother us as the food was great. We came at about 3pm so we got a table right away, but we walked past here a few times after and it was always rammed. So I'd recommend like the other reviewers do and either come here during non peak hours or put your name down on the waiting list and keep an eye on where you are in the list. No free WiFi sorry. "
1674,20-12-2016 ,5.0,We tried to go to this restaurant early one night at 7.00pm but were put off by the queue of people outside waiting for tables.We returned the next night at 5.30pm and got seating at the bar. This was such a fun spot to sit and be part of the action. We were able to select tapas on display and order drinks from the friendly and helpful barman. He did make suggestions on things we should try and this made it an interesting and enjoyable experience. The food was very good and tasty and very affordable. The only negative was waiting customers tapping us on the shoulder and asking us how long we were going to be!
1675,19-12-2016 ,4.0,"This restaurant is a favorite of mine and my husband's. It is always busy with people from all over the world. The tapas are always fresh and the drinks are refreshing. The service is always on point. This restaurant is easy to find and, like the rest of Barcelona, very accessible by metro. We plan to return again next time we are in Barcelona."
1676,19-12-2016 ,4.0,Love the food here. So does the rest of the world. Count on lines and hectic scenes inside but it's worth it IMHO. Quality ingredients. Waiters are a bit too cocky for their own good but hey it's tough to be popular and stay real ;-)
1677,19-12-2016 ,4.0,"We went there because of the reviews. It's a good place to eat but it's better to make a reservation before. They tried to charge the bill with a plate we didn't command. It was rapidly corrected, but we found that a little tricky. So beware before you pay!!!"
1678,18-12-2016 ,4.0," It was packed with customers when we went there for dinner. However, it didn't take long for us to get a seat, although we had to share it with another couple. The bread with fresh tomatoes was very good; the beef tenderloin was tender and juicy. Prices are about the same as most tapas bars. "
1679,18-12-2016 ,5.0,Great tapas! Tried several of the Tapas offered and each of them was excellent. FInally finished with a Crema Catalan.
1680,17-12-2016 ,4.0,If you don't mind eating 'early' by Barcelona standards and arrive before 7 PM (19.00) you can get a table with little or no wait. By 8 PM be prepared to wait. Food is very good as are drinks. Waitstaff are helpful but try to upsell if you allow them to. The place is busy and crowded and noisy but a lot of fun.
1681,17-12-2016 ,5.0,The quality/price rate is great. The food is amazing. Arrive early to not wait for too long cause the place gets packed every day. Highly recommend. 
1682,16-12-2016 ,5.0,"Large variety of typical Spanish and Catalan tapas. You can not reserve, there is always a queue at dinning hours. But it is worth the waiting. "
1683,14-12-2016 ,5.0,Walked up to this place because of its excellent reviews. I was lucky to find a place at the bar just before it became really crowdy (20:00h). It is not the cheapest one (paid 30€ for 4 tapas and a glass of Rioja) but worth the price. Large portions of excellent quality. Superb !!!Friendly staff as well.
1684,13-12-2016 ,5.0,"Good fresh food, big beer variety, u better order a table in advance in rush hours. Try a big variety of dishes and love all of them.There is a daily market menu who proved to be a success.Will come back on my next visit."
1685,10-12-2016 ,5.0,best tapas I've had in Barcelona! My favorite was the steak montaditos and the sangria de cava is great!
1686,10-12-2016 ,5.0,"This place is certainly talked about a lot one of the restaurants to visit when in Barcelona, if you do visit make sure you turn up early to put your name down on the waiting list if its an evening sitting as there is a queue normally and they don't take reservations. This restaurant is very good, once in service is quick and the staff are friendly, the food is excellent with a lot of tapas on offer, around 18 from my last count, my fav on the night was the ""cabreos"" eggs style which was a lovely dish, other dishes were also great, all finished off with some great sangria and a lovely dessert, Worth a visit for sure."
1687,10-12-2016 ,4.0,"Went to this place after having read reviews on tripadvisor so we were expecting service to be poor. To our surprise, it wasn't really that bad with the exception of one Spanish speaking brunette.We were mostly served by this Filipino lady and she was very pleasant and helpful with recommending dishes. We ordered several tapas dishes:Squid ink rice - yummy Calamari rings - so soSquid tentacles - deliciousPotato bravas - okayBeef steak - nice Creme brulee - delish3 texture Chocolate cake - nice and richApple pie - very goodFood was served fairly quickly too which was great. I went on Friday for lunch and surprisingly, while it was packed, we got a table almost immediately. Absolutely loved the food here and would definitely return for the food. Rating would be excellent if this place worked on the minor service issue."
1688,9-12-2016 ,4.0,Lovely tapas restaurant with a lively bar where you can watch the tapas being prepared. We were there around 4:00pm on a week day and the restaurant & bar were both full but we managed to get a table outside. There was a good selection of Tapas and a great wine list. Service was very friendly and efficient. Well worth a visit!
1689,9-12-2016 ,4.0,"40 minutes waiting for table tells you a story of a popular restaurant frequently visited by locals. Tapas meny was mainstream and wine selection a little limited, but a quick service and an experience from the upper shelves. "
1690,9-12-2016 ,3.0,"The Cerveseria Catalana is considered as a must do in Barcelona, but to be honest they are victim of their reputation. You need to get there around 8 to put your name down and eat around 9. And then they serve you in a blink, throwing the plates on your table and speeding you up so you get out and leave the place as quickly as possible for the next ones to come!The tapas are ok, though generally very greasy and seem of medium quality... to be honest if you are looking for some great croquetas and plates of ham and cheese I would recommend the Andreu chains - you will not be disappointed!! "
1691,7-12-2016 ,5.0,"Tapas and wine for ""solo"" or with friends .Quick and efficient service.Spanish beef is exellent. There eat Spanish. "
1692,7-12-2016 ,5.0,"I loved this place - both the food and the fact that if you go early, you can sit at the bar and keep an eye on the new dishes as they arrive. It's a good way to eat lunch, particularly if you are eating alone. I choose a selection of savoury morsels. Those served on bread were a distinct cut above other places, with the bread thin, crisp and seasoned. The highlight, however, was a desert tapa consisting of a small piece of thin bread topped with an unctuous dollop of chocolate - a cross between a mousse and a ganache, sprinkled with oil and salt - fantastic! It put a big smaile on my face. I shall definitely return. The place also has a very good reputation for its Iberica hams. For six tapas and two glasses of wine, I paid about €14 which I thought was good value, particularly given its very central location."
1693,6-12-2016 ,4.0,"all together nice and tasty variety of tapas, you just can't go wrong if you need to play safe on the culinary front.you need to try them once and then look for the special places"
1694,6-12-2016 ,3.0,i ate in several tapas places in Barcelona. this one was is my lowest rated one. the food was good but not great like Tapas 24
1695,5-12-2016 ,5.0,"Must go to in Barcelona. Get the shrimp, clams, pan con tomate, croquettes. One of the best meals youll have in Barca. I studied food here for 4 months if that helps credibility."
1696,4-12-2016 ,4.0," The food is excellent and super fresh. The people there were very helpful in giving advice about what to pick. There's a large sit down portion of the restaurant, but we sat at the counter where there's more decent turnover, but there were constantly people behind us trying to order takeout or vying for our seats. 5 plates of tapas and a beer came out to 32€. "
1697,4-12-2016 ,5.0,One of the best places to eat in the center of Barcelona. The. Food is excellent and service is good. The problem is that there is always queue and no reservations allowed.
1698,4-12-2016 ,5.0,"Excelent tapas, good quality, very fast service! we loved it and would come back again and again and again...the price is ok for the quality!"
1699,4-12-2016 ,5.0,Busy little spot. Staff as mentioned arent the overly friendly however the food is easily the best tapas in the city!
1700,4-12-2016 ,5.0,"It was a Friday evening, thus...Very busy, and so very crowded. For dinner, reservations a must. But for tapas, stand and wait for a bar seat to open up and enjoy! Delicious food!! But most likely a long wait. Interesting local and international crowd. Away from the bulk of tourists, although the word is out."
1701,2-12-2016 ,5.0,"Some of the best tapas I tasted during my 2 week trip in Barcelona, and I was eating tapas for either lunch or dinner every one of the days I was there.Great spanish food and interesting to see that almost all of the servers come from Philippines. Nice, gentle and hospitable people that make you feel comfortable and wanting to stay and eat more and more with their suggestions."
1702,2-12-2016 ,4.0,Choose from a variety of tapas from the counter and you can also order freshly cooked dishes from the ala carte menu. We had a dish recommended by the waitress - made from fried potato chips covered with eggs and sauce? Unique and delicious. Gets crowded.
1703,30-11-2016 ,5.0,One of the best in town Tapas place plus its ambient is like a bar at nights. Really good food and service. Good to go for business meeting even though it's to crowded 
1704,30-11-2016 ,5.0,After eating out every day for one week this was far the best tapas restaurant. So much to choose from and soooo delicious. Gets very busy especially Friday and Saturday evenings.
1705,29-11-2016 ,4.0,"Yes the service is bad, they don't care about you.Yes it seems you need to wait for ages ...not completely right though. I go to barcelona several times a year and always end up there, because the ratio price/quality of tapas is one of the best in Barca.Simple traditional recipes that never changed over the years, that feels good in a city where a top restaurant can disappear from a year to another. One tip for future clients : dont' get discouraged by the waiting time they tell you, it is usually much shorter (they do so to have less people waiting ;) )Another tip : while waiting, check the people at the bar, who seem to be almost finished (i even ask them sometimes if they are, so I avoid waiting in vain), and stay close to them..because as soon as they leave, you can take their seats (reservations are only for the tables inside and outside, but the BAR is first seated first served). One last tip, don't be shy and while waiting, have a look at the tapas exposed in the window and ask what it is (for the ones you are interested in) from time to time, so when your time comes to order, you are READY and you dont need more explanation (that you won't get because they are too busy :) )Still, for me, the best traditional tapas in barcelona ! "
1706,28-11-2016 ,5.0,A great sea food experience! Must visit in Barcelona! This is my favorite sea food place in Barcelona as it offers a great variety of fresh sea food choices all prepared on the spot. Place is almost always crowded so reserving a table is always a good idea. 
1707,26-11-2016 ,3.0,"Visited for lunch. The restaurant is huge, looks amazing and the staff were friendly and helpful. Ordered a variety of tapas and although the food was OK it didn't blow me away and I was expecting more. "
1708,26-11-2016 ,5.0,"We spent an evening with friends. Waited 30 min in line but was worth it. Everyone were friendly, food arrived quickly but the most important, food was sooooo good. Many small tapas, sea food, meat and more. Great Sangaria and desert. Don't skip the beef! Great experience, great value for their money. "
1709,25-11-2016 ,5.0,We are visiting this place allready 17 years. The first time we went there we were sitting at the counter. and suddenly they replaced all tapas platters that were on display in the counter. And there we knew: here they go for the best and freshest food possible.
1710,23-11-2016 ,5.0,Worth the wait for the authentic dishes and lovely sangria. Great atmosphere whether sharing with friends or popping in for a bite on your own away from the hustle and bustle of the shops!
1711,23-11-2016 ,2.0,Why arrive early-? There are 8 tables for 2 pple. and 14 chairs inside. We arrived 9 o' clock (pm). Two other pple were inside. 4 pple were outside. My husband ordered bacon and eggs (they go with french fries) -(bacon and eggs tasted well) - But the fries were so hard he could even not put a fork in it. I ordered a 'bikini' ( = toast with bacon and cheese) . And...my 'bikini' came 10 minutes later....Bread was very thin and 'hardly' toasted. NO ! Never will go there again. Did not see anyone entering after us......
1712,23-11-2016 ,1.0,We arrived knowing it would be busy but we were not expecting that we would be standing 20 min while later arrivals were seated. The hostess Mabel was Extremely rude. Definitely call ahead if more than 4 people. Never got to the food. Perhaps because we are people of color or perhaps because we had children. Not family friendly
1713,21-11-2016 ,5.0,Make sure you arrive early. My husband amd I went in a low season and this place still had an 1hr wait but so worth the wait. Best tapas place so far for me. We ordered pitcher of sangria and assortment of tapas. Extremely affordable. We went after visiting Casa Gaudi about 10 minutes walking. Must go to place.
1714,20-11-2016 ,4.0,"Always great to go back to Cerveceria. Try to go early so you can be seated straight. Spanish eat late so if you go after 21h the place is overcrowded. Take the Cava Sangria, it's delicious. The Jamon de Bellota just amazing. Compared to many other tapas places, here you get good quality for reasonable prices."
1715,20-11-2016 ,5.0,For me one of the best tapas bars in Barcelona. Usually you have to queue to enter. The price is a bit expensive but it is worth to try their tapas for their presentation and for their quality. The staff is very attentive and kind.
1716,19-11-2016 ,4.0,"An really excellent restaurant offering some really fresh and tasty tapas dishes, very popular with the locals, this is a great place to eat!!!"
1717,19-11-2016 ,5.0,"This place serves all the typical tapas and is a very popular location. I would definitely go here because you get to try all the typical things that you must try while you are in Barcelona in a very relaxed environment. I would suggest to not over-order, order a few things, share and then order more, food comes quick. There is a long wait but you can also walk around a bit in the area while you wait."
1718,18-11-2016 ,5.0,"quick service,very simple place but food excelent, you should arrive very early otherwise you'll have to wait in a line,price very good,i went twice and i deeply recomend,tapas are amazing"
1719,18-11-2016 ,5.0,The food was really good and you felt you weren't in a touristic place. It was very autehntic and lots of spanish people and nice folks. You have to make a reservation because it is really booked out most of the times.the restaurant is bigger than it seems from the outside and price/ quality was totally fair.
1720,18-11-2016 ,4.0,"Tuesday 8 pm you would not expect at lot of people at a Spanish restaurant right? well, the place was jam packed so we put our name down on the list, walked around for 20 min and got a table. So booking in advance is highly recommended. Seating outside very limited. Inside is quite crammed but the waiters are super efficient and our orders came out after few minutes. Decent price and pretty good Tapas, worth a visit"
1721,18-11-2016 ,5.0,"What a great place to eat tapas. Pricing is reasonable, drinks are plentiful and the tapas are delicious. You should only be afraid of overeating. Don't forget to order a crema catalana. It's to die for! It's a busy place so come early. It helps to have a north European schedule seeing that the locals eat late. One address you shouldn't miss while in Barcelona. "
1722,18-11-2016 ,5.0,"Great food, atmosphere and arguably one of the better sangria's I've had in the city! Hidden treasure amongst all the other tapas bars in Barcelona"
1723,18-11-2016 ,5.0,"This tapas restaurant has a huge variety for every taste. This is a big place - more than 200 seats, but the service is very good. One problem - they do not accept reservations. If you arrive at 7 p.m. - you will wait for an hour. If you arrive at 10 p.m. you will have to wait for 2 hours!! Bear in mind that this description talks about mid November- God knows what is the situation during the high season..."
1724,17-11-2016 ,5.0,"After reading so much about this place, we definitely wanted to check it out. When we got there it was rammed! They told us it would be a 45 min wait, so we waited! Man oh man was it worth it.We ordered 3 tapas, beef tenderloin, grilled cuttlefish and a goat cheese veggie dish. All dishes were spectacular and well priced. We also ended the night with dessert which was a type of creme brulee which was amazing! Also the Sangria was delicious!!! "
1725,17-11-2016 ,4.0,We had to wait for about 40 minutes to get a table here. Lots of locals and tourists so it is very well known. The menu is very extensive and needs some time. Probably best to go and have a look at what is on offer behind the counter.Service was very good and friendly. Was worth the visit
1726,15-11-2016 ,5.0,"Great restaurant, exceptional food, decent prices. Was there two times and will go again. If you are in town make the effort to go there. "
1727,14-11-2016 ,5.0,"I was fortunate to dine here twice and sample many mouthwatering tapas and drinks. I was met and greeted by staff personnel Sherwin and Beyde. On my first visit (solo), I was seated at an outside sidewalk table next to 2 young French women who I chatted with somewhat about the food choices. Soline and Elise were charming and gracious offering me the opportunity to try their dishes as well. ""Little fish"" as they called it, was quite pleasing and in ample portions. I would highly recommend the solomillos/filet mignons, shrimp brochettes, patata bravas, bread with tomatoes, and various croquettes with delicious filling. On my second visit, I trusted the waiter, William, to recommend other tapas and wines from the numerous choices offered and they were equally satisfying. I saw Sherwin and Beyde again inside the restaurant and they recognized me and were very pleased that I had returned. Unlikely, I would have gone elsewhere if I stayed longer in Barcelona. Certainly worth the wait to sample one of Barcelona's best tapas bars. All around excellent!"
1728,14-11-2016 ,5.0,The food is terrific here. The asparagus tapa stands out. I was a little dubious whether to believe all the rave reviews. Thought it might be too touristy. But it deserves the reputation. Best tapas we had and we visited another highly rated tapas bar as well as the chain tapas places.
1729,14-11-2016 ,5.0,"Busy place, but wonderful tapas and sangria. Excellent to try many different dishes and share with each other. It is also a beautiful place, perfect to spend few hours talking and having good food and drinks. There is also tables available outside. Price was good too."
1730,14-11-2016 ,5.0,Excellent Spanish tapas and you can see the food display in front if you when you sit by the bar. Great selection and so yummy !! 
1731,14-11-2016 ,4.0,"Fresh delicious tapas in a local atmosphere, can get very busy so be prepared to wait it will be well worth it"
1732,14-11-2016 ,5.0,"Service and Tapas was amazing. We actually ended up eating outside under heated lamps. We waited 35 mins for a table at about 9pm. Food is of great quality and is very reasonable. Service staff vary in friendliness, most are amazing, just a couple of moody waiters. I would definitely return and would love to live closer"
1733,14-11-2016 ,5.0,"Fabulous tapas, great atmosphere, friendly efficient service and reasonable prices. What else could you ask for?"
1734,14-11-2016 ,4.0,"Always eat where the locals eat as they know bestThe food is maybe slighlty more expensive than other tapas bars but boy the food is that much betterHuge choice, quick servcie with a smile and great qaulityIt is always busy but stand at the bar have a drink a table or bar seat will come available . Doesnt take that long or book a table for great table service"
1735,13-11-2016 ,4.0,It is not the typical tourist place - people who come here are actuall locals ... Go for the crab tapas ... It is just delicious.
1736,13-11-2016 ,5.0,"Very busy place, we were told to wait 40 min to get the table for lunch or to hunt for bar seats. Finally it was worth to wait. Tapas are fresh, interesting and extremely delicious. Fried potatoes with an egg and spicy sauce just amazing. Busy but friendly waiters! Great place!"
1737,13-11-2016 ,4.0,Great place to taste all kinds of tapas. Extremely busy place with a long waiting time for a table but the staff seems to be genius and arrange everyone in a timely manner. Service was good and fast. Tapas quality was pretty good and I would definitely suggest it!
1738,13-11-2016 ,5.0,"A fabulous place but be prepared to wait for a table as it is always buzzing with dinners, mostly local with the ‘informed tourist’ thrown in! We enjoyed it so much, we went back twice. The staff are excellent and always happy to advise on the food, don’t expect a sommelier, just get stuck into the fabulous food and ask for a bottle of the local wine of your choice – red or white. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices."
1739,13-11-2016 ,4.0,"Was in Barcelona with my husband recently (Nov 2016) for a 4-day vacation. One way to really know Barcelona is to try their tapas as much as you can. I highly recommend Cerveceria Catalana for it's wide selection of delicious and freshly-made tapas. We dined there twice in a row (on our last 2 nights) and we were never disappointed! One tip, be there early as the line starts to build up around 7. Thanks to the friendly Filipino waiters/waitresses who were very helpful in recommending their best dishes. Will definitely come back in Barcelona and Cerveceria Catalana!"
1740,12-11-2016 ,4.0,"We sampled a variety if dishes, there was only one that we didn't care for. There is a huge selection. Unfortunately we arrived arounf 8pm, was told there was an hour wait. Around the bar was so crowded people were packed like sardines. We ended up sitting at the bar as a spot opened, which was not the best way for a first visit. I'm sure if you had a waiter at a table that could answer some questions and make some recommendations it woudl make the experience much better. We much preferred La Pepita but if ever in Barcelona again we'd probably give this restaurant another try."
1741,12-11-2016 ,5.0,We went this restaurant twice. I have read some negative reviews of non local serving or cooking. I don’t see any problems. They work very hard. I rather have hard working non local than lazy local employee. First we went around 12pm and ordered some tapas. They were all so good. Another time we went around 6pm and counter seats were full (as always) we sat by the table and ordered some today’s special. They were so good and we wanted to order more but we were very full and couldn’t eat more. Some waiters were friendlier than others but for us it was no problem. We just loved the food. Love to come back if we have a chance.
1742,11-11-2016 ,5.0,"Went 3 times to try their range of seafood and vegetarian tapas. A wide range available.Favourite is grilled squid and prawns. Tasty and juicy, not tough.Special Tapas menu only in Spanish. That was a bummer. But waiters are always ready to give good recommendations. Tables filled up quickly.Went after lunch hour about 230pm....got a table right away.Food is always fresh and tasty. Ordered 6 varieties of Tapas for 2 people...bill came to under 40 euros. We were stuffed!Will definitely be back."
1743,11-11-2016 ,5.0,Great Tapas place in Barcelona.No table booking - be prepared to spend up to 1 hour if you plan to get the table. Register upon arrival.Another option to sit at the bar. We got place in few minutes Friday evening (mid November).
1744,11-11-2016 ,1.0,After reading all the great reviews we decided to try this tapas restaurant last week. We couldn't have been more disappointed. I am so amazed at the rave reviews. We were a group of six....we went early... 19:30 on a Thursday night....luckily we didn't have a long a wait....maybe 10 minutes. On entering we were immediately told that we couldn't stay more than two hours. The tapas were mediocre and the service was terrible....the staff is condescending to the customers.I will not recommend this place.
1745,11-11-2016 ,2.0,"Non local recepies, coocked by non local, and served by non local, in a place where 99% are tourist... Curious that is named as 'catalan'....However is tasty and price is reasonable."
1746,11-11-2016 ,5.0,Very busy but the food was great and the waiters extremely efficient! May be the best shrimps I've ever had!
1747,10-11-2016 ,5.0,We waited an hour to be seated but it was well worth it. Helpful staff and delicious food. Would definitely recommend it!
1748,10-11-2016 ,4.0,"We visited twice during our 4 day stay in Barcelona, which tells you that the food was that good. As mentioned by others this a very popular and busy restaurant. By Spanish standards we ate here early (6-7) and waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. We tried a large variety of plates and enjoyed them all. Everything is fresh, well prepared and presented. The wait staff does any excellent job in timing so you always have a new plate as you finish the old one. The Sangria is also note worthy. Highly recommend."
1749,9-11-2016 ,5.0,"Went there with my wife,two sons and their wivesThe selection on the menu was just fantasticWe had a large variety of plates and all were enjoyed very much........the food is so fresh and the service outstanding..............this PLACE is a MUST for all TAPAS lovers"
1750,9-11-2016 ,4.0,"It is an always busy place, but it is easier to get a table for a lunch than for a dinner. They do not take any reservations, you need to queue. But it is worth it. They offer great tapas, pinchos and all kind of seafood for tapas. Good choice of wine - a bit touristic but the food is very good."
1751,8-11-2016 ,5.0,"Been here twice and not been disappointed. Very wide variety of tapas, which we found to be exquisite and fresh. Can't make a reservation and the wait can sometime be up to an hour and a half long but I must say that it is worth. There are plenty of nearby bars you can go to while you wait for your time to be seated. "
1752,8-11-2016 ,4.0,Having found this place on trip advisor we decided to check it out. As other reviewers noted there was a bit of wait time for a table (35 minutes) but when our name was called we didn't feel at all rushed. Our waitress helped us to translate the special tapas (the rest of the menu was in English). The chilli prawns are amazing!!!! The tempura cuttlefish was also a highlight. But the dessert was what left us leaving with smiles on our face! We shared three desserts between the two of us (small tapas style at about 2-3€ each). The crime brûlée was a standout! But all sounded amazing. Could be an expensive meal if your super hungry but good value if you share 4-5 tapas between 2. 
1753,8-11-2016 ,5.0,"Great restaurant, great atmosphere. Don't miss the eggs/salsa/chips dish - it's the best on the menu!!Prepare for a little wait, but the wait list is not too terrible. Totally worth the wait!"
1754,8-11-2016 ,5.0,"We went here 3 times in our week in Barcelona! It has a great atmosphere, fantastic food and service. We tried nearly everything on the menu and everything was good. "
1755,7-11-2016 ,3.0,"Came here for dinner and there was a wait list, so we added our name and were called in about 20 minutes. Waiters do not help you with the menu, so we felt a bit lost about what to order. We started with the tapas assortment, but didn't know what came with it because the menu doesn't provide a description. It was croquettes, whole shrimp (with heads and tails on), a few clams, pimientos de padron, and fried calamari. It didn't feel like a very good value for what you got. We also had the patatas bravas, which came with a garlic aioli and were very delicious, and the razor clams. Coffee with milk was very good. Overall, it was an okay meal but nothing very memorable. They are very busy and waitstaff were rushed and didn't provide service that makes you want to come back. "
1756,6-11-2016 ,4.0,"Very good food at reasonable prices with a very good house wine. Recommend to us by an American who has lived in Barcelona for the last 6 years,"
1757,6-11-2016 ,5.0,"Sort this tapas restaurant out, after reading the great reviews on Trip Advisor.It did not disappoint. We arrived at around 4.00pm, and although extremely busy, didn't have to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table.Excellent varied menu, with very helpful staff.Would definitely recommend whilst visiting Barcelona"
1758,6-11-2016 ,5.0,"Very nice food and effective service. Got the food very fast and it was possible to order more through out the meal. There was a line to get a table, so smart to show up a bit earlier for dinner. Not expensive!"
1759,5-11-2016 ,4.0,"We eat at this place at least twice every time we visit Barcelona, which is often. The food is very good and the service is quick. At times the wait is long but since we stay a block away, we just put our name down and return at the estimated time. I look forward to our next visit."
1760,5-11-2016 ,5.0,"Was recommended this restaurant by a friend who had visited before me. Defiantly worth the visit! Had amazing food, great service and buzzy atmosphere. I can see why it is busy every night of the week. If there is a waiting list it is more than worth the wait! Never tried razor clams before but they were AMAZING! 5*****"
1761,4-11-2016 ,5.0,"This place is a real gem, bursting to the seams with locals and tourists-in-the-know at dinner (also bustling at lunch, relaxed at breakfast, we've been here for all of them) you can go for terrace, restaurant, or - as we have done for 17 years - wait for a space at the bar. The foid is exquisite, fresh, cooked/presented to order, and by staff who know what they're doing and understand about service. The montadito caliente ternera solomillo gets our juices going in London as we anticipate it. But everything here is good. Go for the food, the atmosphere, the excellent service, the proximity to excellent bars for afterwards, the excellent value - eg a bottle if Rioja and tapas for two so we were stuffed: around 50 euros. Barcelona really doesn't get much better than this."
1762,4-11-2016 ,4.0,I eat here a lot because its close to my work. Food is good but The place Can be pretty full and busy.

1764,3-11-2016 ,5.0,"Every time in Barcelona, must have diner in CatalanaVery friendly staff, especially one who is responsible for terrace.Always recommends good vine, with good price. Foot, you can get everything, because everything is worth."
1765,3-11-2016 ,4.0,More a restaurant than a tapas bar this popular spot offers excellent food at reasonable prices. A couple can stuff themselves on fine small plates for under 50 Euros including wine or sangria. Come before 7 or expect a half hour wait for a table. Don't miss the shrimp skewers.
1766,2-11-2016 ,5.0,"Try all the tapas, they are great. Specially if you like meat: The Solomillo. If it is not cooked to your taste you can have it send back and they will cook it just how you want it. We loved all the deserts! they are so delicate...so you can have a bunch...or all as we did if you share. But there isn't much to share..and you might want to order some again."
1767,2-11-2016 ,5.0,"My wife and I we're fortunate to be staying at a hotel just two blocks away on Mallorca . We decided to go out, having read the reviews we knew we needed to get there about 7 o'clock because crowds grew quickly however we arrived at 7:45 and we're looking at an hour wait. We decided to put our names on the waiting list, then proceed to the bar and wait on the off-chance that something would open up in the meantime after being consistent and checking back to see if my name had been called several people had not shown up for their reservations my wife and I happened to be seated just 15 minutes later. The service here is excellent by Barcelona standards relaxed atmosphere relax service which is not a bad thing it gives plenty of time for socialization we tried several plates of Tapas all did not disappoint we really did have a nice night out would recommend anyone in the area to stop by and enjoy the atmosphere as well as great food"
1768,1-11-2016 ,5.0,"There are so many incredible tapas to try and great sangria. I was unhappy that a seat at the bar was my best option but I had so much fun. First of all I could see what other people ordered and it made me try more dishes, also met fun people! I loved the gambas, my favorite dish. It is very hard to get in so come early! Yet it's also worth a wait! "
1769,1-11-2016 ,5.0,"Great food, great atmosphere good value for money. We waited for a while but it was worth it potato's bravas were excellent, sat at the bar while waiting the drinks were reasonably priced would definitely come again"
1770,1-11-2016 ,5.0,one of the best tapas places... a friend recommended it and I in turn would recommend it too.Very good price vs quality ratio with fresh tapas made to order.
1771,31-10-2016 ,4.0,"Eating tapas in Barcelona can get expensive very quickly. Catalana is not cheap, but the quality-price ratio is high. I consider the price reasonable for a nice dinner. Everything I had was tasty. Ruel, my waiter, recommended some very good things to try. He also makes a mean gin and tonic. Instead of looking at the menu I recommend talk to the waiters and do the point-and-ask. It's more fun and less stress this way."
1772,31-10-2016 ,5.0,"We were a group of 9 and we decided on having a early dinner. We arrived at 6 and are could have a table.... So basically, the food is great, very fresh and the service is very efficient and kind. The desert are made under your eyes... You can be sure you are not served a disgusting frozen stuff.When we left at 8 the queue of people was just amazing. You can't book so get there before 6.30.The prices are reasonable. We spent about 20 euros per person. This is the best restaurant we visited in Barcelona... Not to be missed!"
1773,31-10-2016 ,2.0,"we liked the food, esp. the tapas, but the service was lousy. you do not feel welcome there, long wait, no response.. guest worker/waiters who do not care at all..."
1774,31-10-2016 ,5.0,This place was amaizing each time we have been there. Always people queing and always fresh and great food.
1775,31-10-2016 ,5.0,Arrived around 6pm and we were asked to wait around 20-30 mins which we were okay with since we read all the reviews of this place and wanted to try it out. Spoke to others while waiting who mentioned long queues and good food so we were really excited for it. We arrived in good time it seems for the line of people soon started to grow after we arrived. We were shown to our table after about 10 mins which was great. When the food arrived we weren't disappointed at all. The seafood was tasty and fresh. The tapas was very tasty. Calamari in particular was finger lickin good. The price was so reasonable and the portions were also good. The staff were also very nice and we had a really nice meal that evening.We look forward to coming to this place when we visit Barcelona next time.
1776,30-10-2016 ,5.0,"Really tasty food - especially the seafood. Arrived around 6:40pm,30mons wait which was really decent! Here is what we have ordered - everything was great! Prawn skewer - brocheta de langostinosAnchovies, tuna, pepper, olives - anchoas, atun, piniento, olivasGreek salad - griega: queso fresco y tomateWhite anchovies in vinegar: boquerones en vinagreFried hot green peppers: pimientos de padronWarm escalivada with goats cheese: escalivada tibia con queso de cabraPatatas bravas"
1777,30-10-2016 ,4.0,"Heads up: arrive either soon or late otherwise be prepared for some waiting time ( on. Sunday we had half an hour waiting time having arrived @ 6.45pm). The service is really fast so the reason is the high number of people wanting a table. Don't be scared by the noisy entrance as there are more quiet rooms inside. The space is modern and with a cozy ambiance. The tapas are well prepared and some do have a great look. Take your time to see what other are choosing and don't be shy to point to some passing dishes and say ""I want that"" The desserts are also well prepared and in the right proportion (I.e not too heavy). Enjoy it with friends or family , maybe not the best for business. Also seatings outside (with some heaters in the cold evenings). "
1778,30-10-2016 ,5.0,"Went, yet again for a light lunch. The daily menu is as good as ever with choices for even the most foody fadists.House wine still looks like Abadia at a bargain price. We were fitted in just after one o'clock on Thursday. No wait this time!Despite the comments that this place is only for tourists we were surrounded on all sides by well heeled locals.Service - professional as usual.I have no connection with this place, but I wish I did! It is busy. One can only wonder why they have so few immitators."
1779,30-10-2016 ,5.0,"I visited this restaurant around 9 years ago and in 2016 and did offer the best Tapas now and then.I would recommend this place to anyone who wishes to enjoy a variety of Tapas be it with friends, family and surely to discuss some business.I had friends who visited the place twice in two consecutive days during our event in 2016 and the feedback was great in both times.Must visit."
1780,30-10-2016 ,5.0,"One of our favorite restaurants in Barcelona. It gets really busy but we got there a little before noon on a Sunday with no wait. Loved the Spanish French fries with the runny eggs on top. Perfectly flavored and so good. The asparagus and mushrooms were also fantastic! The pork belly sandwich was good - the bread was crispy and the roasted red pepper was also very good. The razor clams were a bit fishy, but good. Did not like the California salad much. The chicken and ham croquettes were average. Good environment - lively and clean with lots of space! "
1781,30-10-2016 ,5.0,"Great tapas, good service and lots of customers. Long waiting time for table, visit approx 45 min before you want to eat dinner and reserve table. "
1782,29-10-2016 ,4.0,"Enjoyed the variety in tapas but too crowded and noisy. Waited more than an hour standing outside at the curb. Not worth the wait. There's other great places for tapas where you don't have to wait this long. Service is ok, you feel just another tourist."
1783,29-10-2016 ,5.0,Fantastic and good tapas in a Spanish environment. Every tapas is good and super fresh. I recommend all friends to go here.
1784,29-10-2016 ,4.0,"We had to wait an hour for our table when we arrived at 7pm - which goes to show just how popular this place is because it is already crowded at 7!! It was uncomfortable standing waiting for a table because there was no proper waiting area - and we get into the way of the busy waiters. Despite the crowd the waiters did not try to hurry us in our meal. They were efficient and friendly. Tapas is very good in the seafood section but I would not recommend the patata bravas. Try any of the shrimp, octopus and even the razor clams. Delicately cooked and tender. Leave some space for the dessert. Quite small servings thus just right to end the meal without feeling too stuffed. "
1785,28-10-2016 ,4.0,We got their around 10:00 pm and only waited for 10 minutes to be seated (outside though).Our waiter was very friendly. I knew from other reviews what I wanted to have. Spanish Omelette was good and you must try the steak tapas!Also that potato fired with egg was good too. I forgot the name of that dish.Overall great Tapas experience
1786,28-10-2016 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a prime destination for tapas in Elxample, so get there early, before 7:00 PM, despite the hostess's suggestion ""before eight."" The tapas are wonderful but it is the montaditos that shine: piled spider crab with a shrimp or salmon topper, white anchovies in vinegar, cod croquettes, Iberian ham. So many to try. Good Blanco but more choice among the Rojas. A crowded but perfect evening."
1787,27-10-2016 ,4.0,Enjoyed our late lunch here today. Had to wait 20 minutes for a table which is a good sign.Enjoyed the gambas in oil and garlic as well as the pan fried fish (Whitebait??)Lobster Paella was a real treat so should try.
1788,27-10-2016 ,4.0,"Our first dinner in Barcelona. After a very long flight, a good dinner is a must. Catalana restaurant did not disappoint us! Great selection of tapas and superb service. Servers were attentive!! Note - this place is a first come, first served seating. But worth the wait!"
1789,27-10-2016 ,4.0,"We tried to get into this place around 7:30 pm on a Sunday night with a local Barcelona native that we knew. Over a 1.5 hour wait so we went elsewhere. However, I returned the following night around 6:30 pm with no problem. So get here early if you want to eat here. They do not take advance reservations. Why is it so popular?Because it is an excellent tapas bar and restaurant with reasonable prices. Yep, it's loaded with tourists but locals go here too. There is a large interior restaurant area as well as an outdoor dining area. There is also a bar counter area where you can go if you are a single or with one other person and don't want to wait for a table. However it fills up too as the night goes on. The tapas are outstanding! They also have a good selection of wine and beers. I will definitely go back to this place!"
1790,26-10-2016 ,5.0,"Great selection of tapas, fresh ,with a slight innovative touch. Is always extremely busy but if you sit at the bar you can get a seat earlier as you can't make a reservation. Totally worth the wait!"
1791,26-10-2016 ,5.0,"This place is amazing, in the middle of the centre and not so expensive comparing to the restaurants in the passeig de gracias. Very good tapas to a good price. I recommend this place to everyone. the only negative is that the place is always crowded but its worth waiting to get a table."
1792,25-10-2016 ,4.0,"We managed to find a seat at the bar after waiting for some time. The food was good, but unless you make a reservation you might have to wait for an hour or so."
1793,25-10-2016 ,5.0,Great tapas cozy setting! Alway busy and need to wait but it worth waiting! The food is always fresh and well prepared!
1794,25-10-2016 ,5.0,"This place across the Hilton hotel is fabuloso, had been here before 14 years ago and still has the same great food and atmosphere tailor made for the savi Barcelona locals.If you like the Spanish tapas thing seat the BARRA/BAR but when busy lunch 12-4 and dinner 9-1 will have to wait up to 1/2 hour wait with a glass of blanco, for the restaurant tables the wait is up to 1-1/2 hours. BUT IT IS WORTH IT.The bar friendly staff will easy accomodate your needs start with one of the many vinos or cervezas.The bonus when you seat at the bar is you can see the tapas a selection of up to 50, then you also have the blackboard for specials and the menu for larger plates, so park yourself behind someone who is in the last leg of eating chat to them and take their seats when the go. The normal stay for the locals at the bar us less than 1 hour.So do the lot, 4 wine glasses (they not big) start with cava, blanco, rosado and tinto with normally one tapa for each glass if there are small and some are then have two try to matched with wine for absolute pleasure.The best part this place is great value.RECOMENDED AS THEY SAY ""YOU CAN NOT LOOSE"" IN HERE"
1795,24-10-2016 ,5.0,"Never a disappointment! Though it lost its original charm through renovation the food still is one of the best tapas in town! Try The brochetas de Langustino, el montadito de ternera, a montadito de jabugo and calamarcitos a la plancha and you will know what I mean. TIP: try to get a place at the bar! The fight is worth it! Much better than seated inside"
1796,24-10-2016 ,5.0,after reading about the crowds. we decided to go for an early dinner.. and had no problem getting a table.. think we arrived before 7:00 p.m. by the time we left there was a line outside. we enjoyed delicious food and inexpensive wines. Would definitely return on another visit.. preferably with friends so we could try more tapas.. the portions are very large for just two people.
1797,24-10-2016 ,5.0,I'm a little ashamed to admit it because Barcelona has such amazing restaurants and I hate going back to the same place when traveling when there are so many places to try but my husband and I were staying down the street from here and we ended up coming here 3x. This place is open late so we found an excuse to come late at night after an earlier dinner as well. We waited about 45 min the first time (went across the street for a drink and came back) and didn't really have to wait much other times since we were staying so close and we wised up and stopped in outside of peak times. It's one of the few places in the area that's continuously open and open late which is a big plus. I can't even recall all the different dishes we tried as we must've eaten almost 15 different dishes but the two that were at the top of things I ate in Barcelona were the huevos cabreaos (thin crispy potatoes topped with tomato sauce and runny fried egg that is all mixed together) and the beef tenderloin skewer topped with fois gras (we added the fois....). We went back there 2x just to get those items again. The montaditos are good too and I'm not a huge fan of the tomato bread but the ones here were good because they were small pieces and hot and freshly toasted. But really get those other two dishes... I dream of them.
1798,24-10-2016 ,4.0,"Arrived to Barcelona after midnight and wanted to connect to the city...Arrived to the Cerveceria around 00:30 and the place was still busy, but I didn't need to wait and had a place on the bar. Had very good Navajas (Razor Clams) and some Pimento de Padrón with Sardinas Fritos and caña. Splendid beginning for my BCN tour"
1799,24-10-2016 ,5.0,went little before 7pm so wait was only 10 minutes( time to see all selections)everything was great fast maravel seated us quickly
1800,24-10-2016 ,5.0,"The food was amazing, the service great, and the atmosphere very relaxing...my only advice is to book a table beforehand or head there at slow hours to find a table fast otherwise you'll be stuck in a long waiting line but definitley worth the wait"
1801,23-10-2016 ,5.0,Recommended by hotel reception staff and it didn't disappoint. It appears to be constantly busy and we were told a 40 minute wait for a table however there are stools around the 2 bar areas. One of the servers behind the bar invited us to sit on 2 recently vacated stools. This meant no wait for a table and we could order directly from the severs behind the bar straight away instead of waiting to be served at a table. We could also see all the tapas in front of us which was great as itallowed us to see it before ordering. One of the bars has all the raw fish to be cooked tapas and the other larger bar has all the ready prepared tapas and salads. As well as a seed area in the back of the restaurant there are also some tables outside under some parasols.The staff were very efficient and we're happy to recommend dishes. Dishes were of a reasonable price. The food was very nice and I would recommend this tapas bar.
1802,23-10-2016 ,5.0,"This tapas bar is excellent Value for money and the food is outstanding. I had to wait about 15 mins for a table but it was worth every cent. Delicious food, reasonably priced (wine too) and yummy desserts. Do not miss this place for tapas in Barcelona. Highly recommended "
1803,22-10-2016 ,4.0,"No matter when you go to this place, it is always busy. The food is good, no doubt, but it is probably not the best food in town either. The wait can be quite long, as loads of tourist tend to visit this place. All in all a decent place, but be aware that it can be quite busy. "
1804,22-10-2016 ,5.0,One of the best in town Tapas place plus its ambient is like a bar at nights. Really good food and service. Good to go for business meeting even though it's to crowded 
1805,22-10-2016 ,4.0,"Found the restaurant on our second attempt and after that, we ate there for the remaining 2 days we were there.. wish we found it earlier (it was located very near our hotel on Passeig de Garcia). Heard about this restaurant from other sites and it did not disappoint. The waiting time can long especially if you want to sit at the tapas bar or outside. Our wait was short as we didn't mind sitting inside. Restaurant is nice, staff service was good and we enjoyed our food thoroughly. Would definitely go again!"
1806,21-10-2016 ,4.0,We were at a hotel nearby... very turisty but a nice place .. go after 11pm or later to get in without wait. The staff are very sweet and professional. Lots of fun at the bar area.... meet all sorts of turista from everywhere... There are a few more places newby owned by the same owner and apparently with very similar menues.
1807,21-10-2016 ,4.0,"Every order came quick , even too quick! As if they want us to finish and free the table as soon as possible cause people are waiting outside .The food was very good but spicy was not very spicy and I didn't get drunk from the sangria like the past two days in other places :)"
1808,21-10-2016 ,5.0,We ordered several tapas. All were excellant. We were planning on coming back to this one but got delayed one day so we ate closer to the hotel. This place seems to be crowded all the time but we were just 2 people and got a table right away. I have to agree with friends that pointed us to this restaurant. It is one of the best in Barcelona
1809,21-10-2016 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant twice while in Barcelona. Both times there was a wait, but it was well worth it. The tapas are fantastic and very reasonably priced. Their Huevos rotos (fried potatoes topped with fried eggs) are out of this world. The wine is also very good and very inexpensive. I will be back if we are ever in Barcelona again!"
1810,21-10-2016 ,5.0,"My wife brought me here and it was the best. We had a counter place which was great if you like food. Freshly made food, be it tapas or seafood dishes, were all excellent. Go there early as the restaurant doesn't any reservations. "
1811,21-10-2016 ,5.0,"I was there during their Saturday night rush. We didn't have reservation but managed to sit on the bar (you don't need a reservation for that, just be patient and wait until someone leaves). We really enjoyed the experience of sitting at the bar, we kept ordering more and more dishes and received guidance from the lovely bartender/server who was there. Their twist on crema catalana dessert was one the best desserts I've ever had (and that's coming from a New Yorker who's a dessert fanatic)! As for the food, you can't go wrong with what you order. Will go back for sure."
1812,20-10-2016 ,5.0,"Its worth the 20-30 minutes wait. Even thougj this Spanish restaurant is owned by Filipinos, the produce, ham and all other ingridients are CLEARLY authentic Spanish. There is a great variety of tapas and wine. We had the Bacalao with honey montadito, as well as the classic ham and manchego plate. Pan con tomate and croquetas. All simply amazing. "
1813,20-10-2016 ,4.0,Very good tapas with very fresh fish. Quite lot of people willing to eat here. If you come soon it is better. Quick service. Good price. If you are around choose this tapas restaurant 
1814,20-10-2016 ,5.0,"After tried several tapas restaurant in Barcelone, I have been recommended to go to the Cerveceria by a spanish colleague. Honestly, the best tapas in Barcelona I have eaten. Choice is wide with tapas difficult to find elsewhere.But they are victim of their success and, as they do not take reservation, you have to choose the right time to go there (not between 19h and 22h). Otherwise you could be asked to wait for hours."
1815,19-10-2016 ,2.0,"After I greeted the manager friendly, he chose to look me in the face with no acknowledgement or greeting. Were lead to a table where people are squeezed in like sardines even though there were empty tables. One good not help but hear every word people sitting on both sides at other tables, were saying. Server more like a sergeant major- no friendliness. Wanted to get order asap - they operate on quick turn over."
1816,19-10-2016 ,4.0,"Went with locals as an introduction to one of their favorite tapas places. 15 mins or so wait at 7.30pm. The overall dinner took a long time (two rounds of tapas and dessert), but it was fine because we were with friends. The food was delicious - we let them order so ended up with some surprises and new experiences. Except the tortilla - that was disappointing. Spent about 60E for two kids, two adults and 1l sangria. Very good value - I expected a higher bill based on the ambience and the quality. Friendly service. Quite loud, very busy, rather upscale. It was okay for older children, though I probably wouldn't have been comfortable with smaller children."
1817,19-10-2016 ,4.0,"Busy, but well worth a wait! Nice bar area to wait in for dinner table. We had to wait 30 min but had some wine and tasty tapas while waiting. Restaurant busy but nice and friendly service and really good tapas. Wine was excellent and setting modern and relaxed. Go there! "
1818,19-10-2016 ,5.0,"We'd read that this place was popular, that's an understatement. It took two attempts to get it first time the wait was an hour and a half, the second time we went a little earlier around 7pm and waited half an hour, but it was worth the wait. The food is delicious all freshly prepared and it all arrived quickly. There's a lot of buzz and a great atmosphere inside lots of hustle and bustle. Price is not too upmarket and the quality of the food is worth paying for. "
1819,18-10-2016 ,5.0,This restaurant was fun if a little busy. We had to wait an hour for a seat but went to a local bar in between. Even though top rated on Trip Advisor and obviously busy because of this it was still fun and felt local. In fact we sat next to a local person who told us what to do (told us we didn't have to order from menu but could tell counter guys what we wanted from counter to be delivered to our table). As a couple we spent €56 on loads of food and a large beer each so happy with that price!
1820,18-10-2016 ,4.0,Good food nice service lots of people and waiting for more than 40 minutes but the food it worth the time!
1821,18-10-2016 ,5.0,"I am a really big fan of Tapas and the Cerveceria Catalana had been recommended to me by some locals. So I gave it a shot and I am happy that I did. The food was absolutely fantastic, especially the different variations of ""pulpo"" and I also loved the asparagus with salt. The service was extremely friendly and attentive without being intrusive. They even managed to survive my poor attempts in speaking spanish, and switched to English when they noticed that I had issues understanding them without making me feel embarrassed. There are two seating areas, one more in the back where one sits at a normal table and has a Menu or at the bar where one just points at things. I tried the normal table last time and was happy I did because it is a bit more recluse, still I will give the bar a try when I am back in a couple of weeks time, because it also looked nice."
1822,18-10-2016 ,3.0,"Very disappointing from an ""Experience Barcelona"" perspective. I didn't see a single local in the place, either among the customers, or the staff. This is a place that caters entirely to tourists, and there are long waits, and a disinterested depressing but hard working immigrant wait staff.That said, the food was ok to good.But if you are looking for a more authentic experience, there are hundreds of little nameless corner sidewalk cafes that serve just as good and better tapas with a more laid back and relaxed atmosphere."
1823,17-10-2016 ,3.0,"Really between average and very good. We first tried this place on our first night but the restaurant had an hour and a half wait. We decided to try it for lunch the next day and got in within fifteen minutes. The daily specials are not in English so you have to ask the servers for help but they seem to be in a rush. The service is quick, once you order, your food arrives rather quickly which only adds to the feeling of being rushed. Some of the tapas were very good and some were average. We are glad that we got to try it for the sake of our curiosity!"
1824,17-10-2016 ,4.0,The bliding quality of the food together with the fair prices makes this place an ace in the heart of Barcellona. It get easly packed: wait few moments because it is more than worthed. The service is polite and fast. Personally I reccomend to seat in the bar and select directly the tapas or the grilled/fried fish you would like to eat. I definitely reccomend it.
1825,17-10-2016 ,5.0,"This was recommended by the hotel Alma and we were not disappointed. First time at a real tapas and it was very good, not too expensive and very friendly. I even broke a wine glass and they did not make me feel stupid. Very crowded at 2pm on a Monday and had to wait for about 20 minutes. It was worth the wait. Had two local beers and they were very good. "
1826,17-10-2016 ,3.0,"This place was recommended by friends so we went there for lunch. It was amazingly popular, does not take reservations, so we waited 30 minutes, as it was said to be very good. Unfortunately, we were disappointed by the quality of the tapas...we had much better elsewhere."
1827,17-10-2016 ,5.0,"We were staying at the Europark and looked up top tapas restaurants. This CC came up at the top of the list and was within walking distance so off we went. I knew to expect a wait and we arrived at 8:00pm and were told the wait was one hour. If you can find an open seat at the bar you can eat sooner. We tried that but the bar area was so crowded and other people were already circling like vultures. So we just waited patiently outside and were pleasantly delighted to be seated in about 40 min with a prime sidewalk table for people watching. The food here is beyond amazing, such an experience!! I never knew something as simple as food and vegetables could be so delicious and complex. We also fell in love with Cava that night. I will never forget my night at CC."
1828,16-10-2016 ,5.0,"Delicious tapas, quick service. You probably will wait in line, but the hoster will find you quickly the table or the place on the bar. Don't miss the famous ""Cabreaos"" Egg Style. It's a thin chips with spicy tomato sauce and the egg.The waiter will mix it all in front of you. Bon appetit!!!"
1829,16-10-2016 ,4.0,The source which came with the famous patatas bravas was something special. Other tapas menu was also descent. If in doubt place.
1830,16-10-2016 ,5.0,Great seafood tapas and ambience. Excellent servicePopular place - we waited 1 hr to get a table - but it was worth it
1831,15-10-2016 ,5.0,"We were in Barcelona for 5 nights recently and found this wonderful Tapas Bar and Restaurant close to our hotel. We went in at about 7.30 each night so did not have to line up to sit at the Tapas Bar. The food was amazing and the service was fun and friendly. We did not feel rushed to leave and certainly the range of Tapas was huge and kept coming out from the kitchen.You MUST try the ripe figs with jamon and cream cheese and their anchovie, green olive and tomato on rye was a taste sensation. We were not disappointed and went back three times. Just a warning, their Sangria is potent."
1832,14-10-2016 ,5.0,Finally got to this recommended place on my last day in Barcelona. Did not disappoint. I only had the basic tapas - but the best I had had in 5 days by far. Good service. Not miss the potatoes!
1833,14-10-2016 ,5.0,I came across this restaurant on TripAdvisor and decided to try it. I was very surprised to find that it was almost across the street from our hotel Alexandra by Double Tree. My wife and I went about 6pm and didn't have to wait for a table. It was a new experience with the menu but when we finally worked things out with the help of the waiter everything was good. The portions were many and small not like in the West with a big main course. I ordered 4 portions of different courses and was not overly full at the end plus the cost was not excessive. The place was very busy and full. I would go back again in a heart beat.
1834,14-10-2016 ,5.0,This restaurant is very popular. We were not disappointed with our visit. The food was served in small portions but that way you could try more than one thing. The service was very fast and delicious.
1835,13-10-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended by our Airbnb host and turned out to be our best meal. Initially put off by huge waiting time, we were told 40-50 mins for a table for 2 around 16,00 but then were seated within 10 mins ! Menu was difficult to understand as only in Spanish (certainly the daily specials were) but the (Phillipino) waitress was helpful in translating and explaining. Food arrived quickly and was excellent. Whole restaurant was lovely and had a great buzz, would highly recommend and will be back next time we are in town. Bill around Eur 50 for 2 people with beer seemed reasonable."
1836,13-10-2016 ,5.0,Truly the best god damn tapas ever I've been every time a go to Barcelona i visit this restaurant amazing food great atmosphere well worth the wait but in the summer months nice to have a glass of wine and wait on the street for your table just unreal food great price I fell in love with this place the first time I went and was recommended by a travel guide it beyond super it's fantastic they do this whisky soaked cake with cream that's insane but the best is the entire menu I can't tell you how good this place is heaven in a restaurant if your after true authentic Spanish tapas you must try this place trust me it won't disappoint you can't book but even if there's a queue get a glass of wine and wait xx 
1837,12-10-2016 ,5.0,"This was honestly one of the best meals that I've ever had! I recently dined here with my colleagues/friends while we were visiting Barcelona. It was recommended by the hotel receptionist, and I cannot begin to describe the amazing food.Everything was tapas style, so we shared many dishes, including the most amazing baked cod with a buttery sauce on top, curry chicken kababs, grilled hot peppers, a stacked potato/cheese/tomato dish, and grilled seafood. We shared Sangria which was amazing and authentic, and finished off the meal with incredible desserts including a triple chocolate cake, and custards. We did also order a carrot cake type dessert which never came, but we had ingested more than enough food to keep us satisfied.To note, we did arrive quite early for dinner at 6pm as we are used to North American dining, and it was quite busy at that time, but as we were leaving, they were quite eager to rush us out as there was quite a long lineup of people trying to get in just as we were finishing at around 9:30pm.I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and it was some of the best food that I've ever had. Our bill for 4 pill came to just over 100 euros which is an incredible price for the amount of food and alcohol we ordered."
1838,12-10-2016 ,5.0,The menu caught our eye when we were wandering the streets of Barcelona. We knew it would be a good place to eat at due to the fact that the restaurant was full and we waited only a few short minutes for a free table. The service we received from the staff was absolutely amazing and it was obvious that they were working hard. The tapas we ordered were very delicious and showed off the best flavours of Catalonian food. Prices were moderate and the diners around us were very friendly.I would definitely go back in future visits. 
1839,12-10-2016 ,5.0,"Amazing place! Fresh food and friendly staff. Sat at the bar two days in a row for lunch and it was absolutely incredible! For the quality of food it is very reasonable as well. It does get very busy, don't be afraid of ordering a drink from the staff while you wait."
1840,12-10-2016 ,5.0,"You must go and you must wait. But definitely worth the wait! We went our first night in Madrid and we'll go back the last night (and we ate at plenty of great tapas places while here). Highly recommend the ham, garlic shrimp, eggs over crunchy potatoes, and sangria. And at the waiter's suggestion the bread pudding. Possibly one of the best desserts ever."
1841,11-10-2016 ,5.0,"Went there because of my friend's experience, 5/5, all of our orders was great, and the chips with eggs / the bread crumb dessert / 3 chocolates dessert were specially awesome. "
1842,11-10-2016 ,5.0,"What a great tapas place !!!The table arrangement could be a bit better, but the food was absolutely amazing. Remember not to order too fast at once and try as many tapas as possible. Basically you can order from the menu + dishes you see on the bar windows. "
1843,11-10-2016 ,5.0,"if you re looking for excellent local Spanish food , with the best prices , this is your place , its elegant , nice ambience , excellent location , the only thing that u need to know , its first come first serve , no reservation are accepted , so u might wait for an hour or so to be seated , other than that , their menu is rich , food is over the top , and prices are extremely affordable"
1844,11-10-2016 ,5.0,I can say that you can get best Quality with reasonable price...Green peppers are excellent. I recommend this place.
1845,10-10-2016 ,5.0,"I arrived alone and the hostess was very attentive. She assigned me a seat immediately next to the counter. I tasted the Sangria, Montadito of Piquillo, Montadito of Cangrego (crab), Gambas (prawns), Solomillo (Sirloin) and Patatas bravas (potatoes with aioli sauce), everything was delicious.The only negative: I had to review and change my invoice 3 times because the waiter charged me for snacks from other customers. After changes my bill was reduced from 60€ to 33.05€. So I would advise to check your detailed invoice before you pay."
1846,10-10-2016 ,3.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was just 1 1/2 blocks away from our hotel and was recommended by the hotel staff.Food: Just a bit above average. We had quite a few tapas. . Fried peppers: Quite good. Garlic Shrimp: Quite good. Asparagus and Mushrooms: Just OK. Tomato bread: Just OK. Calamari: Just OKDrinks: A glass of house red wine was drinkableService: Was very quick. I think that was designed for quick exit. Different wait staff took our orders with a high tech gadget. So no matter who took the order, it was accuratePrice: ModerateWould I go there again? Yes. If I am close by and am tired. If not, I would go to some other restaurants really renowned for the tapasClientele: Mostly tourists. It is a huge place. People kept coming and leaving."
1847,10-10-2016 ,5.0,"There are many good restaurants in Barcelona, however, this one consistently stands out & was great!! It was my 3rd time visiting this spot and was not disappointed! The drinks, food, and experience were all enjoyable. Delicious flavors of tantalizing dishes were served tapas style and we couldn't stop ordering and even duplicating dishes. The beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth delicious as well as the mini hamburgers, padron peppers, potatas bravas. Great vibe, energetic crowd, good service, and incredibly tasting food makes this spot a great choice when visiting Barcelona! "
1848,10-10-2016 ,5.0,"The place is nice but it was way too crowded, the waiting time to get a table was more than an hr. However, you can sit on the bar if there is space. The waiters on the bar are very helpful and they give you good recommendations. The Sangria was fantastic, and I definitely recommend the skewers, garlic shrimps, ham and cheese croissant, and the cheeses tapas."
1849,10-10-2016 ,5.0,"Very busy, noisy place with a lot of caracter. We were lucky to be sitted at the bar very quickly. Tapas are pretty standard, wine is cheap."
1850,9-10-2016 ,2.0,"We were very disappointed in this restaurant. We read a lot of reviews about this place and some of the reviews stated that it wasn't any good but we decided to try it anyways.......our mistake.The long wait is not worth the hassle for this restaurant. Most of the people eating at the restaurant appeared to be english speakers/tourists and we saw very few locals there. The hostess was very friendly but once we found a seat the waiters were mostly curt in their service.The food was an extreme disappointment and far better tapas can be easily found elsewhere. The food is very oily and of poor quality. The ""smashed eggs"" that everyone is raving about is nothing more than greasy french fries with a fried egg on top. I would not recommend this place."
1851,9-10-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant is part of a group and was recommended by a friend that lives in Barcelona. Not disappointing! Environment fun and lively, food creative and delicious! Worth the wait!"
1852,9-10-2016 ,4.0,"we went to 3 of their different locations and all were great. I especially loved the eggplant, pepper, zucchini cheese melt that I ordered in 2 places. They serve the tapas with the standard bread with tomato oil on them. each location has great decor and great service. this location was my favorite!"
1853,9-10-2016 ,5.0,If is about food i can just say was very good and in quite good price.Just one little think was annoying for me when waiter start to sweap the floor during my meal towards me. Maybe it's nothing but aftet 15years of experience in hospitality I wouldn't do it.Staff behind bar are polite and helpful. I asked for english version of menu and I got it very quick.
1854,9-10-2016 ,4.0,"Food was good and fresh, but too many people throughout the day! And not easy to order from the menu, so better get a seat at the tapas bar and point at whatever you wanted."
1855,8-10-2016 ,5.0,"Service is excellent. Staff are friendly. Food is great. Have to wait in the evenings for a table because it is so popular, but it is worth the wait! Would recommend it."
1856,8-10-2016 ,5.0,"From the sangria to the smashed eggs, to unusual deserts, the food was absolutely wonderful. Staff attentive. We arrived around 6pm, just in time as there was a queue just after that so get in early! Would have went back if we had more time! "
1857,8-10-2016 ,5.0,"Excellent food. lots of choices. good quality and price is right.You need to know that sometimes waiting time for a table could be more than an hour. However and because above, people are patient to wait."
1858,7-10-2016 ,5.0,The hotel recommended Cerveceria and it was a great recommendation. The food and severe was outstanding. There are many Tapis selections. The food was fresh and delicious. I will definatly go back again.
1859,7-10-2016 ,4.0,The atmosphere of catalan is very lively and the food is fantastic. Some of the best tapas in Barcelona. The service by the wait staff Is inefficient. Not that big of a deal because the place is usually packed after 5 pm. I recommend the pan de tomates with Iberian ham and green peppers. Very good! worth the wait.
1860,6-10-2016 ,5.0,"This place is hands down the most efficient and professional service I've ever experienced. I've never seen staff move so swiftly! It was like they read my mind and acted before I'd said anything!And the food - I'm not overly experienced in tapas style menus but the staff were very helpful in making recommendations and translating the tapas of the day. The peanut crumbed Camembert was an absolute highlight but there was nothing I didn't like - also had the patatas bravas, a few of the flautas (all done mini baguette style), the baby calamari, it's hard to remember them all. The three texture chocolate dessert was incredible and quite rich. I loved the strawberries in orange juice too. Just a great night all round and will absolutely return! Slightly above what I'd usually pay for a meal (as a traveller) but I wanted to try lots and it was so worth it - approx €25-30 pp. 10/10 would recommend!"
1861,6-10-2016 ,3.0,"The food here was amazing and the hostess was very quick with getting us a table. However one of the waitstaff was extremely rude with us which made our overall experience bad. We don't know anything about tapas so I asked him if they had ""Gambas"" because I couldn't find it on the menu. ""You can find it on the menu"" He replied back in a very rude manner. Obviously if I was able to find it on the menu, I wouldn't have asked him the question. He seems like a senior waitstaff or something. He was wearing all black uniform, bald & seemed pretty old. My note to management: Please re-train him on how to treat his customers in a professional, kind manner. Overall, the restaurant was very clean, had a nice ambience and the food was really great."
1862,6-10-2016 ,5.0,"I would qualify the menu items as ""large tapas"". Went there as a couple for lunch and were able to share a selection of dishes with beer. It was a very pleasant experience. The place fills quite fast so we went early. Service was fast. Very good value for the money."
1863,5-10-2016 ,5.0,"Always good, fantastic tapas. In the old days it was great now a bit too many tourists, but always good. I normally eat breakfast here when I am in BCN and have some tapas or dinner with friends. Great place. "
1864,3-10-2016 ,5.0,When you arrive/ go to the lady who had the booking list in the restaurant book your table . You have to wait a while we were told 90 mins but got seated 60 mins later ( we went across the road to another bar for a few drinks!!)Food was worth the edit and reasonably priced . You must try the prawns and the goats cheese - top class . So good we went back the second night John the waiter and his X Beydy looked after us well. Also Alan and La Fea the second night . When I go back to Barcelona this is where I will be heading . The place attracts the locals which is s good sign . First night cost us a total of 55 euro and the second night 70 euro which included drink / fantastic value 
1865,3-10-2016 ,5.0,"The husband and I arrived around 1:40 pm - 2:00 pm. The restaurant was filled to the brim for a Monday afternoon. It is a bit chaotic trying to figure out where to put your name - thank goodness William came to the rescue! He explained that there are two lists - one for the inside seating (20 minutes - leave your name inside at the desk and one for the outside seating (45 minutes - leave your name with him). I think we waited maybe 20 minutes for seating to open up for two. Very pleasant surprise! Love it when people over-estimate the time. Helps cut down the line and gives for a pleasant surprise. We had the lovely Erica serve us (at least that's what the people next to us said was her name :) We needed her advice on what to order for the Tapas of the Day (this is only in Spanish) we ordered two items off that part of the menu and three more items off the daily menu. Tapas of the Day:- Razor Clams- OctopusNormal Menu:-Green peppers (Be careful of random super hot peppers)-Calamari (Perfect)-Asparagus and mushrooms-White Anchovies (OMG- BEST ANCHOVIES EVER! not overly salty - every anchovy was fried with love (I think))Dessert:-Chocolate three ways (Not normally a chocolate girl, but seriously delicious and not overly decadent)-Coconut pudding Service from both Erica and William was fast, professional and smiley! <--- very important to me.Would come here again and will recommend my sister to come here when she studies abroad! :D"
1866,3-10-2016 ,5.0,"Based off a friend’s recommendation, we went here for dinner a few weeks ago. They do not take reservations so the first night we tried to get in, the wait was too long so we came earlier the next night and were able to get in within 20 minutes. There are a few tables to eat outside, but that “line” is different than the “line” to eat inside. The inside of the restaurant has many more openings, so I recommend you eat there.The service was good and we actually asked recommendations from different waiters who stopped by, and we weren’t disappointed. I can’t remember everything that we had, but the stand out was definitely the huevos cabreados (or something of that name) - a freshly fried egg cut into matchstick potatoes with a spicy sauce. It was soooo good – good enough that we got a second order of it as our dessert! We also got the shrimp in garlic sauce, a mixed vegetable dish, ham croquettes. If we had more nights in Barcelona, I would have gone to this restaurant again. Everything about it was delicious."
1867,3-10-2016 ,5.0,Tapas were great there and the staff really polite!!!You ll have to wait about 10-30 minutes because there too many pepople who wait for a table...buτ it is worth it!!!
1868,3-10-2016 ,5.0,"Really great vibe, needed to wait an hour cause they don't do reservations. Really great and small dishes, the waiters were friendly, but the spacial weren't in English and we guessed one good dish. This are the more simple one"
1869,2-10-2016 ,5.0,"Excellent food. Friendly staff. Our waitress was a real character! Loved the tapas, initially thought that the choice was limited. Nothing disappointed! The sweet menu was different i.e. the menu itself. Choices were different and everyone enjoyed them. Go early to try to avoid the queue."
1870,2-10-2016 ,5.0,"Make sure you get there in time, or that you are willing to wait or sit at the bar. but !!! its worth it, its authentic good food and not expensive."
1871,2-10-2016 ,4.0,Fantastic place for tapas - especially the squid was lovely.. Good place to grab a quick lunch though we had a leisurely lunch :)
1872,2-10-2016 ,5.0,Great option for breakfast or lunch tasting delicious Spanish Tapas: location close to the main visits in the city Center
1873,2-10-2016 ,4.0,This place gets crowded real fast so do make a reservation to avoid being disappointed! The food is good: the highlights for me were the grilled cuttlefish and the desserts. The prices are really good! Give this place a try!
1874,1-10-2016 ,1.0,"We came to this restaurant because of the good reviews. What a disappointment. Unfriendly staff, a dirty and crowded restaurant and standard tasteless tapas.This is a tourist trap. No value for money.There are hundreds of better tapas restaurants in Barcelona."
1875,1-10-2016 ,4.0,Stopped for a cold beer after a long day sight seeing in barcelonaoutside pavement table cold beer small plate of olives
1876,1-10-2016 ,5.0,One of the places I always take visitors. Everyone walks away happy! Great place for tapas but don't miss the special menu they have. Always something good to try and its fresh!
1877,30-09-2016 ,5.0,Great and authentic tapas. Helpful staff even for English speaking foreigners. You can sit at the bar and take what you want or wait for a table and order from the menu. Classic Catalan tapas very reasonably priced. Swift and friendly service.Lots of locals so it feels like the real thing. Wish we could return in the evening!Close to la Pedrera and Battlo houses so easy to walk to.
1878,30-09-2016 ,5.0,"First time in Spain, and first time I'd tried tapas. Our hotel concierge recommended we try Cerveceria Catalana. We were reluctant when they told us no reservations accepted, but we knew right away when we arrived that it would be a great place: a wait-time of 35 minutes at 7:45 p.m. ( this, when the norm for going to dinner is 9 p.m.), and the clientele was ~3/4 Spaniards.The restaurant was well-lit, alive, vibrant and teeming with activity. They offered a cornucopia of food -- can't begin to tell you of the number and variety of tapas on the menu. Suffice it to say, whatever you select will tickle your fancy. The server provided plenty of suggestions for a virgin tapas eater, and every item was scrumptious. First time I ate Maine lobster, I was with friends in Bar Harbor. We bought two live lobsters, popped them into boiling water at our campground, melted the butter, and proceeded to devour them. I've never had lobster as good as that again in my life! I was spoiled, forever. I'm afraid I'm in the same boat after having my first tapas at Cerveceria Catalana."
1879,30-09-2016 ,4.0,"No reservation, so you have to go early. Has plenty of spaces.Very good croqueta de bacallá (cod fish), pimientos padrón, but the best was the spicy chorizo. Not a fan of the nuts around the baked Camembert."
1880,29-09-2016 ,4.0,"This restaurant was excellent, very busy, but they found us a table quickly. Assortment of tapas dishes ordered, and all were very tasty and reasonably priced. Would recommend "
1881,29-09-2016 ,4.0,About 1 km from Placa Catalunya. Went at 5.30pm & had no trouble getting a seat. It's a rather big place & the crowd started streaming in towards 7pm. Service was brisk & efficient. Wide range & delicious. My favourite were the bamboo clams. 9.15 euros for a plate of 5 pieces. One cannot presume that all dishes are tapas size as some dishes come in big portions.
1882,29-09-2016 ,5.0,"Went here last night on recommendation of a bellhop at hotel nearby. This place is a Joplin' and does not disappoint ! Wow! Great wine, beer, and best of all, tapas! Food was high quality for price and the staff couldn't have been nicer. They helped us and we know very little Spanish. We ordered shrimp, salmon, peppers, and vegetable tapas. All came quickly and were delicious. Note: this place is always crowded, so friends... Get in line... Put your name on the list, have a drink, and your table will be ready in no time! Bar seating looks awesome but we did choose a table. Sit inside or outside! A new favorite place when we return to this great city!"
1883,29-09-2016 ,5.0,"In a word, Cerveceria Catalana is DELICIOUS! It was so good, we went back twice. Yes, that's right, in a city like Barcelona where there's good tapas to be had on every block, we went to the same restaurant twice...so glad it was walking distance from our hotel. My absolute favorite dishes were the Bravas potatoes and the Beef Tenderloin Flauta (baguette sandwich)."
1884,29-09-2016 ,5.0,"Great great sangria, awesome tapas. this place is definitely a must in Barcelona. went here several times during the time I was there."
1885,28-09-2016 ,4.0,"It's always busy. People must be reading the TripAdvisor posts because when I went there, there was a 30 minute line up with a good number of people checking TripAdvisor on their phones. It is worth the wait. Everything is great. If there is room at the bar area grab a chair. Or is entertaining to watch the staff and customers. Order more than you want to try as much as you can. I was here 3 days in a row. Didn't want to chance a place with less quality or taste because I think this one set the bar. "
1886,28-09-2016 ,4.0,"Was told this is a great place by the hotel staff. They also stated it is a huge local go-to place so be early and be prepared to wait. We waited, but not too long. Food was really good, not the usual touristy tapas and such. A bit expensive but service and food delivery was fast and adequate. I would eat here again, but not wait longer than 1 hour. The food is good, but not that good. Did not have a bad dish so nothing to recommand in particular. But hey, they are tapas.....try them all! We did."
1887,28-09-2016 ,5.0,Waah!!! Except the waiting time this place is fantastic. From simple dishes like eggs and fries to the fresh seafood everything is amazing. Not to forget the montaditos like grilled shrimps or solomillo and foie or camembert... and the best comes with the bill: really down to earth and affordable. One of the best in Barcelona don't miss it!!
1888,27-09-2016 ,5.0,"Visited here whilst in Barcelona. What a great restaurant, good service, good menu. Although busy we were seated fairly quickly. I suppose if you wanted to sit outside you would have to wait longer Food was good."
1889,26-09-2016 ,5.0,"Went here twice during our week in Barcelona in September 2016. It's normally very busy but it's worth waiting for. We went at lunch time and early evening. Prawns in garlic sauce are great, as are potates braves...tried so many dishes. Sometimes the waiters talk too quickly through the dishes of the day - would be helpful if it was also available in other languages - English, French, German etc. Can't wait to go back - already booked our hotel and flights for June 2017!!"
1890,26-09-2016 ,5.0,"We visited barcelona for a weekend and must have eaten here 4-5 times. It is great for breakfast whether you want a quick coffee and pastry at the bar or a more leisurely meal. It has a really authentic feel. Frequented by locals and tourists alike. Be prepared to queue for a table in the evening (up to an hour for dinner), but it is worth the wait, and there is a buzzing bar where you can enjoy a drink while you wait. There are a few tables outside if you are lucky! If you don't fancy queuing for a table you can sit at the bar but again the seats are first come first serve. I would definitely visit again!"
1891,26-09-2016 ,5.0,"It is unbelievable how affordable this place is, given the consistently high quality food on offer. Expect to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, but it is worth it. Easily my favourite restaurant in Barcelona."
1892,24-09-2016 ,4.0,"This restaurant was referred by my Hotel and I was not disappointed. Friendly, helpful and knowledgable staff, great food and sangria. Warm and relaxing environment, both outside and inside at the bar, where I sat and met a few people, which is always a bonus when travelling solo. Would definitely revisit when I get back to Barcelona. Thanks to all the staff. =)"
1893,23-09-2016 ,5.0,It's a must in Barcelona. The food is excellent and it is very well located. Very busy so get there early and have a drink until you are called.
1894,23-09-2016 ,5.0,"My significant other and I had one of the best meals during our trip here. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We were lucky to find a seat at the bar on a late Tuesday evening in September and our bartender, Ruel was so helpful! The food was fantastic! We loved the razor clams and the garlic shrimp. We met new friends who were sitting at the bar next to us. It was a lively atmosphere with fresh delicious food. We would have waited if we had to, but so lucky to have sat at the bar and chatted with other guests."
1895,23-09-2016 ,4.0,This restaurant was recommended to us by our BnB host and his endorsement was right on the money. The range of tapas were wonderful very colourful and beautifully presented on the plate. We arrived and the place was already humming and by the time we left there was a cue waiting to get in. Five adults ate a range of dishes for $100 including a jug of sangria - an excellent evening meal in nice modern surroundings. 
1896,23-09-2016 ,5.0,We came here after reading the reviews. We were not disappointed. Had to wait around 20 minutes for a table for two but ie was worth the wait. Great tapas and great dessert for a very reasonable price. Would recommend
1897,23-09-2016 ,5.0,Great place to eat lunch or dinner. Go earlier if you want to find a table as it's veeery busy. Grilled cuttlefish was the best!
1898,23-09-2016 ,5.0,"Very good tapas at 1 :30 pm. We ate at the tapas bar upon the suggestion of our morning guide. He told us to watch what the locals ordered and ask for what looked good. Very good advice, and we had an excellent experience "
1899,23-09-2016 ,5.0,"Must go here for tapas when you are in Barcelona! Don't be put off by the wait. We couldn't believe how busy this place was when we arrived! It was an hour and 20 min wait for a table outside so we went to one of the bars near by for a glass of wine - there's lots of things to do in the area as it has nice shops, tapas bars etc. Luckily we went back after 40 mins to check and we were next to get a table so didn't need to wait an hour and 20 mins! The staff were friendly and made some nice recommendations and the wine was good and not expensive for a bottle. The winner was obviously the food! Lovely tapas! We ordered a few and then when we had finished ordered a few more and all of them were very enjoyable. Good value for money too - €66 for bottle of wine, water and lots of tapas for two! Would defiantly go back....we might visit again before we leave! "
1900,22-09-2016 ,5.0,"I started going to this restaurant last year based on my friend's recommendation and this year, the very first thing I did after checking into my hotel room was rushing to get some tapas. Part of me was thinking that may be the food is not going to be as good as last year, but was I wrong! It was better than last year. Since I have been here in Barcelona, I tried 2 other tapas bars but was deeply disappointed. So I keep going back to Cervezeria. I always get the grilled shrimp which is outstanding. Also, their veggie dishes like mushroom and garlic are out of this world. The wine selection as well as beer, beats other places. On top of it, it's a great place to people watch. Don't expect to find a chair at the bar or a table without reservations, it is always very crowded with very nice people. The price is extremely reasonable for what you're getting which is the best and freshest quality. I can't wait to go back."
1901,22-09-2016 ,4.0,Came here the first night we landed in Barcelona and it remained one of my favourite meals throughout the trip. Iberico pintxos were great and the prices are reasonable for the food quality. Friendly servers. English menu is available but font size is super small so be prepared to examine the menu for a while as you figure out what you want to eat!
1902,22-09-2016 ,4.0,"Probably one of the best tapas restaurant in BCN. Which is obvious since there is always a long wait to get a table at night. I've been here 3 out of 4 visits. Never disappoints. The food is great and worth the wait, just be prepared to wait for about 30-60 minutes. If you are a company of two then you can always hope to get a place by the ""bar"". There is no wait, just take a seat when others leave. The seafood is really good, you should try it if you make a visit.Mixed feelings about the staff. We had a waiter who was really nice and attentive but also a waitress who did not seem to like her job very much. "
1903,22-09-2016 ,4.0,"Very good tapas restaurant with big variety. If you sit in the bars you can see the plates made in front of you and choose what you like, and also see all the fresh ingriedients that they use. Its very close to casa batllo. You can sit either inside or outside. We enjoyed our lunch there!"
1904,21-09-2016 ,4.0,"We tried coming here for dinner on Saturday around 9pm and the line was out the door. Too hungry to wait, we dined elsewhere, but were determined to come back. Wanting a light snack, we came here around 5pm on a weekday and got seated immediately. The highlights of the meal were the Spanish omelette, the beef tenderloin, and the shrimp/calamari. However, we were disappointed with the sangria, which tasted almost watered down. Would come back here again, but not for the drinks."
1905,21-09-2016 ,4.0,we were there around midnight and restaurant was still full we tried different seafood tapas and all were delicious
1906,21-09-2016 ,5.0,The best food for the best prices. Too bad they don't take reservations since there is always a line. 
1907,21-09-2016 ,4.0,"Tapas was very nice, and the desserts were amazing. We asked how big they were and the waitress told us tiny, so ordered 4 for two people...they turned out to be normal dessert size!Get in early or be prepared to be put on a waiting list (we went to a bar and waited there for an hour). If you're not there when they call your name they will move onto the next person."
1908,21-09-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant was worth the wait in Barcelona. The highlight was the desert. We ordered the bread-pudding and it was divine. The tapas are great, the ambience is fun and the staff were friendly. Highly recommended"
1909,20-09-2016 ,4.0,"We are here twice in 4 days in Barcelona. Dont miss it! Can pretty much guarantee that anything on the menu is a win here - the beef tenderloin montadito is sensational. Grilled asparagus & mushrooms, calamari and sangria. Order more than you can handle and you won't regret it! "
1910,20-09-2016 ,5.0,"The food was very good, the atmosphere was great, the service was very good, the picked out great things for the hole group. We were 8 girls and had a very good time."
1911,19-09-2016 ,5.0,"Visited this restaurant on a recommendation from my gaudi tour guide (thanks Patrick!) it was hands down the best meal I have had in Barcelona! They have the normal menu in English but the best thing to do is try some dishes from the specials menu (the small slip of paper only in Spanish). I sat at the bar on the left, it was perfect because I could see the seafood specials in front on me. The waiter behind the bar was also very helpful.My one tip is to get in early! I got there a bit before 7 and had no trouble getting a seat at the bar. 20 minutes later the place was packed and there was a line out the door of people waiting for tables. "
1912,19-09-2016 ,5.0,"Pretty posh looking tapas restaurant. Went there during tea time and it did not disappoint. Tried the combination platter of 5 tapas for 20-30 euros and it did not disappoint! And just for your information, the menu served in cerveceria catalana and ciudad condad are EXACTLY THE SAME because they belong to the same management group!"
1913,19-09-2016 ,5.0,"Wow, this place is sooo good. We just stumbled on it by chance, went in for lunch, it was really busy but we got a seat at the counter which was great because we could just point at what we wanted. We tried a selection of their tapas, everything was delicious. Good quality fresh food at it's best."
1914,19-09-2016 ,5.0,"A very good tapas place, got lucky and sat at the bar and ate tapas. Wait time for a table is always around 30-45 minutes but well worth the wait. Food and service was outstanding. Great way to start a vacation."
1915,18-09-2016 ,5.0,"Great Sangria, attentive staff, wide variety of menu choices, reasonably priced, excellent food and flavors, enough vegetarian options, and scrumptious dessert."
1916,18-09-2016 ,4.0,We visited this place twice in two days for lunch as it's great... Sat at the bar drinking while picking a few tapas to eat.. It's simple but great! If I lived there I would be a regular here! Just on the top of Las rablas it's a perfect location too for grabbing a bite when out shopping. 
1917,18-09-2016 ,5.0,You cannot book for this restaurant. We arrived at 9.15 and were given a 90min wait but it was well worth it. The servers are clearly used to the high volume of clients and therefore the service is fast and efficient. The Sangria was great bacalau was to die. Infact everything we had was a delicious culinary experience 
1918,17-09-2016 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant based on its trip advisor rating. We were not disappointed. We hadn't made a reservation. We were asked to wait for 20-30 mins and we were seated within that time. The ambience was fantastic. The service was great, very customer friendly. If I come to Barcelona again I have to come to this restaurant again. "
1919,16-09-2016 ,3.0,"Visited as we were this end of town and I had researched places to eat at via trip advisor and this place was mention for Tapas.The food and service was good but I had eaten better Tapas at places with half the exposure! Don't visit just on the sake of ratings, very touristy and food nothing special. No complaints just did not see the hype for such high ratings!"
1920,16-09-2016 ,5.0,"This was our second visit and we were glad we came. Admittedly, a bustling place, kind of noisy but with great food and service. In fact the service is almost too good since dishes are delivered only minutes after you order. If you want to linger, order only one or two tapas at a time. We shared six different dishes and all were very tasty. Seemed to be a mix of travelers and locals, all of whom looked like they were enjoying themselves. Prices were very reasonable for a touristy city."
1921,15-09-2016 ,5.0,"Despite the long queue, the food is definitely worth waiting for !! It was simply delicious. Will undoubtedly come back and advise you to try ! "
1922,14-09-2016 ,5.0,The food is great! Make sure you have time (1 to 2 hours) to wait for stable during most busy hours. Very touristic but worth going! Place And staff are nice but no special decor. You go there for the food!
1923,14-09-2016 ,5.0,"Even though there is always a queue to get a table, it is always worth it. Fantastic food, great drinks, good service and the value for money is really amazing. I would highly recommend it."
1924,14-09-2016 ,5.0,"We loved this Catalan cerveceria. They serve an delightful variety of tapas, beers, and wines. The seafood is excellent.be sure to try their daily specials. We sat at a communal table and had convivial conversations and even shared the delicious food."
1925,12-09-2016 ,3.0,"We have to wait for few minutes before we were seated but it was worth it, we sat outside but the indoor was also nice. The staff are very good, they were able to help us alot in which food to choose. The food is also worth its price. "
1926,12-09-2016 ,5.0,"we absolutely loved this tapas restaurant. reasonable prices and great quality! my favourite was gambas al ajillo. there is usually a big line and you can't make a reservation, but if you don't want to go in peak hours it's a reasonable wait, and it's absolutely worth it."
1927,12-09-2016 ,4.0,"We had this spot recommended by a local who really enjoys this restaurant. She advised when to go to avoid the lineups and we were seated right away. Service was prompt, sangria excellent (not all ice!), and food delicious. Would go back but are heading to Madrid tomorrow. Try the crispy Camembert"
1928,12-09-2016 ,5.0,"This is a fantastic place to eat, no matter what time of day you will need to wait- whether to find a table outside, or inside or at the foodbar where you can watch the tapas being prepared. The food is sensational, fresh and changes every day. We were in Barcelona for three days and ended up eating there every day. Not only is the food good but the atmosphere fun."
1929,12-09-2016 ,5.0,"What a great place! The food is outstanding, nothing to comment on this. Furthermore, it is always crowded, especially in the evening where there is most likely a waiting line of 30 minutes at least when you visit."
1930,12-09-2016 ,5.0,"Love going to the bar of the cerveceria instead of ordering a table, since the atmosphere is cool. Otherwise the tables (terrace or inside) are usually taken and you need to wait. Great wine and tapas selection :)"
1931,12-09-2016 ,5.0,午餐時段到造訪，Cerveceria Catalana呈現：（美味的食物 + 美好的氛圍）x 公道的價格 = 美妙的經驗，推薦作為在巴塞隆拿的首站，認識Tapas + Vino + Beer的好地方！
1932,12-09-2016 ,5.0,"This place takes no reservations, is very popular so you can easily expect to wait 90 minutes or more but it is worth the wait since it has some of the best tapas in Barcelona. You can put you name in and walk around La Rambla or have a drink in another place nearby which is what we did. The four of us enjoyed many tapas of iberico ham, croquettes, peppers, cheeses, gambas and more. Each was better than the next. They also have one of the better sangrias I have had in Barcelona. Service is good and prices reasonable so if you can manage the wait you will love the food."
1933,11-09-2016 ,5.0,"We were near La Pedrera and wanted a place nearby and this restaurant was great for tapas and wine. We had a bottle of a wine call ""Sol"" and it was lovely. All the tapas were great, seafood, potatoes but I liked this fried Huevos dish with an egg on top that you mix together, yummy. A good place where service is quick for lunch, yet you can also take it easier and linger for a while and drink a whole bottle of good wine :)"
1934,11-09-2016 ,4.0,"This seems to be a must when visiting Barcelona. The restaurant is very famous, does not take reservations. You'll need to place your name on the list, go for an hour and come back. The food was good, desert was also good. Deserves a good 4 but not a 5 as some of the dishes lacked strong taste."
1935,11-09-2016 ,5.0,"Fantastique place! One of the best Tapas meals we had in Barcelona. They take no reservation. Its worth waiting to get seating. Don't be put off by long tourist lines, we also saw many local families eating there. To begin with we where sceptical, but turned out to be treat! Reasonable prices."
1936,10-09-2016 ,5.0,This place was amazing..can't fault it one bit and would definetly recommend. The crispy Camembert was sensational. 
1937,10-09-2016 ,5.0,Great food! Tapas and beer! It's a must if you're in Barcelona. Go between 4-8pm to avoid the crowd. 
1938,10-09-2016 ,5.0,"We only had breakfast here, but the offerings were excellent and very good value. It was near our hotel so we passed it many times and for lunch and dinner the queue was generally out of the door! You cannot book, you just have to turn up, so if you do not like queuing, then you may have to carefully time your visit!"
1939,9-09-2016 ,5.0,"I had read similar glowing reviews of this restaurant and since this was located a block from our hotel, we had to try it. We went on a Thursday evening at 8PM and found the place packed and had a waiting list of over an hour. Since our hotel was nearby, we figured we would get on the waitlist and come back later. It was so worth it. The tapas dishes were very fresh and flavorful, the service was impeccable and although still very busy, the atmosphere was enjoyable. I had referred others staying in our hotel of this place and was thanked after they tried the place."
1940,9-09-2016 ,4.0,"I reviewed a tapas place before, and this restaurant was basically the confirmation that the one we want to before was better. This restaurant still had great food, but the atmosphere and the food just didn't match our previous experience. This is why I'm giving it a 4 star."
1941,9-09-2016 ,4.0,"Price are a bit high, since it's close to one of the most expensive streets in Europe. However, food and drinks are very good and worth the money you spend."
1942,9-09-2016 ,5.0,Went here on our last night of three in Barcelona. Definitely saved the best for last. Food and wine excellent and great value. Only wish we'd found it earlier. 
1943,8-09-2016 ,4.0,Best service and system I ve ever seenWide range of choicesTasty and extravagant cuisine especially in seafood. Try as much as you can
1944,8-09-2016 ,5.0,"I am a beginner in spanish cuisine but after visiting few tapas places in Barcelona i went to Cerveceria...The fish of the day tapas was a blast, everything was delicious and very good cooked. The recommended wine went very well with all the dishes."
1945,8-09-2016 ,5.0,"This place is like a theme park for the palate. No need to go to a restaurant with a Michelin star and your checking account suffers an earthquake to your palate enjoy a party. At this place ask for what you want , do not eat much and returns again and ask for different things. And so on to infinity. If you do not live life, it is that someone is living for you ."
1946,8-09-2016 ,5.0,"Noisy, overcrowded but still very popular. We visit this restaurant every time we are in Barcelona and will continue to do so. Being a group of 6 we expected to wait a long time for a table but were lucky to get one straight away, on the condition that we needed to be finished in 2 hours. After we got the food ordered it went smooth and one gorgeous dish was served after the other. With as much food as we could eat, dessert for all 6 and 3 bottles of wine we ended up with 40 eu per person. Very decent. Highly recommended. "
1947,7-09-2016 ,4.0,"I have eaten at Catalana several times with different groups of co-workers and it is always a crowd pleaser. Some of my favorite tapas dishes include the crispy Camembert, salmon, asparagus and mushrooms, and the calamari. The place is always packed and unless you want to wait an hour plus- get there early! Always ask about the daily specials ! The only spoiler would be the noise level at times."
1948,7-09-2016 ,4.0,"This restaurant offers a good selection of tapas choices and was recommended by a friend.I agree that the food and the ambiance (open kitchen, spacious, yet not too much) were good. Our waiters however were uninterested, not sure if we just had bad luck but this was much too 'efficient' for my taking as if I was at a cheap fast food place.Would still suggest you to go (as the four star rating reflects) but I hope they improve on the level of interest the waiters show to their guests."
1949,7-09-2016 ,5.0,"The place to be for lunch. Just take a place at the bar or wait to be seated at a table. Great tapas, fresh fish, fresh seafood, absolutely the best tapas bar in town!"
1950,7-09-2016 ,5.0,"Really nice tapas, huge restaurant that was busy at 1pm and full when we left an hour later. Lots of tourists their but also loads of locals too - it was recommended to us by a local so don't believe all the reviews! We didn't have a bad dish and the two of us left full up having paid €45 for 6 tapas dishes, a jug of sangria and a beer. Would recommend. "
1951,7-09-2016 ,4.0,"The restaurant has really good tapas, however I would recommend to sit and eat at the bar as the dining area is not the most cozy. It might also be due to bad luck as we got a table surrounded by several leaks in the roof and with waiters running by all the time. But good tapas so would go back for a visit (sitting by the bar next time)."
1952,7-09-2016 ,5.0,Excellent service and quality of food. Very creative with ingredients . Simply put a Weel thought out plan and the place is crowed day or nite.
1953,6-09-2016 ,4.0,It is a very touristic restaurant. You should wait around 30 min to get a table. The tapas are good but don't forget to ask the daily menu. They have English menu but that doesn't contain the daily dishes
1954,6-09-2016 ,1.0,Not worth the hype of the queue. Quality of the food is not special or anything to go out the way of. Would not go back. Staff are miserable and table service is not great. There are much better places to go for tapas in Barcelona.
1955,6-09-2016 ,5.0,"We found this place on trip advisor and decided to give it a go for lunch. There was a line at the entrance, no doubt others in the same boat as I- and was told it would be a 40 min wait. Luck was on our side, and it turned out to be a 10 minute wait with most people finishing their lunches at 2pm. We were super happy about that. The food was fantastic and fresh and came at a reasonable price for what you get (~30euro for about 4 tapas, drinks, dessert and coffee). I definitely recommend."
1956,6-09-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant was our favorite of the trip. When we first tried to eat here, the restaurant was really busy (around 8pm) so we opted for something else. However, when we returned later in the trip we ended up eating around 12am. There was no wait, but there were still several people there eating and drinking. The food was still fresh and delicious even at midnight! The wait staff was friendly and the drinks were generously poured. A great find for great tapas!"
1957,6-09-2016 ,5.0,We found this restaurant our last day in Barcelona. We wish we had found it sooner as it was the best tapas in Barcelona. Sat at the counter in the late afternoon. It was like dinner and a show as we watched them prepare and set out tapas. Huge variety. Many of the wait staff speak English. Incredible quality for a reasonable price. 
1958,6-09-2016 ,5.0,"We had a celebratory lunch including beers and Cava yet this was still one of the most reasonably priced meals we had in our visit.Very friendly and highly efficient staff. Lots of options on the tapas menu, we tried most between us and everything we tried was fantastic. Great atmosphere, lives up to the hype of the reviews!"
1959,5-09-2016 ,5.0,"Our hotel concierge recommended this place for tapas, and it was great! There was a bit of a wait (around 40 mins), so we sat by the bar and got started there. Definitely try their melted brie - it's like a deep fried cheese stick rolled in nuts! "
1960,4-09-2016 ,5.0,"Had a fantastic dinner here. So good food. And very nice price....Will absolutely recomend it!Try the scrimps om bread, so good!The tomatobread you get is amazing!"
1961,4-09-2016 ,5.0,"The food is amazing, and the service out of this world, Carlos the waiter just choose for us and he brought us an unbelievable and delicious food!!! Just let him choose for you!!!! Don't miss this place if you come to Barcelonq!!!!"
1962,4-09-2016 ,4.0,"Every time we are in Barcelona we come here as the tapas are that good – in my opinion they are one of the best! So, if it’s great tapas you are after then come here. The only downside is that everyone knows how great it is that you will have to wait, regardless of when you decide to go so be prepared to wait up until 1 ½ hours. The way it works is you put your name down on a list, and then wait…and wait…but be patient as it’s worth it, and it's very reasonable. Oh, the other thing you have to get over is the service – which is a mix of rudeness, disinterest and general apathy - but this is not uncommon in Barcelona in general – so as long as you just let it go, you’ll be fine."
1963,3-09-2016 ,4.0,"Staying on Avenida Diagonal, just couple of blocks from Cerveceria Catalana. Saw place on walk today, decided to give it a chance, not disappointed. Put name in - 30 min wait on Sat night at 8:00pm.. But snaked chairs at the bar (first come first served). All in all very nice - bottle of cava to start, with several tapas - very good, very helpful server at the bar - deserts were to die for by the way! Worth the wait - fun, busy, and tasty. "
1964,3-09-2016 ,4.0,Great and innovative food. Especially their dessert card is fun and surprising. Prices are fair and the staff is very friendly.
1965,3-09-2016 ,5.0,come early to have the huevos cabreaos and piles of fresh fish and seafood- v crowded around mealtimes and no reservations possible.
1966,2-09-2016 ,4.0,"We were there following a Catalan friend recommendation, so we had quite big expectations. We somehow managed to get 4 places in this rather busy and animated place.We had beers, sangria and some Torres wine, quite good. I must add that the wine offer was not very generous, but, then again, this is not a place to sit and enjoy a good deep wine.I won't discuss here the menu, as there are so many items on it, but I would rather share an impression: fast! This place is fast, it is like a tapas fast food place. And by this I mean no lesser thing...it's only a sensation you have that you come, eat and go.The place is otherwise nice, jamming with people, but yet the staff manages to sort things out admirably.Recommended for some fast track tapas, not quite so for a cozy atmosphere and long drinks."
1967,2-09-2016 ,5.0,"I really love this place! They offer quality tapas at ok prices. It is always crowded and they do not accept reservations, so once you are there you will have to wait for free table. My favourite tapa is goat cheese with almonds and raspberry sauce. So delicious! This is one of the restaurants i visit regulary and always brig some friends with me."
1968,2-09-2016 ,5.0,"A great place to enjoy tapas in Barcelona. We were warmly greeted and seated right away. The wait staff were very helpful and friendly. Instead of ordering from the menu, they invited me to check the tapas out at the bar. They recommended several dishes- grilled octopus, Iberico ham and tomato bread, foie gras and potato, baby squid and beef tenderloin. Every dish was fresh and delicious. The octopus was perfectly grilled and tender. Baby squid was lightly breaded and sweet. Foie gras and potato was rich and flavorful. The service was excellent. Staff were very attentive and made sure plates were cleared to give us room. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. They also have a bar where you can eat. We decided to go for early lunch, around 12 noon to avoid the crowds. The wait can be long during peak times. The dining area is bright, clean and airy. Tables are well spaced. This restaurant is located within walking distance to Las Ramblas/Placa Catalunya. A must visit when in Barcelona. "
1969,2-09-2016 ,5.0,"We were in city center ready for dinner. Previous experiences weren't in line with our expectations. We asked taxi driver for suggestions, he gave us a couple and we choose Cerveceria Catalana. Great place!Wide choice of meals, prices clear, service fast and accurate. Price even below what you can expect in Barcelona and turist area.Meals quality is exellent! I'll come back next visit in Barcelona!"
1970,1-09-2016 ,5.0,"Wow that was some quick service ! The only thing that took more than 5 minutes, was the mini hamburgers !! The service was quick, attentive and precise. Not one mistake in a quite difficult table of 10 people with different orders, and current drink-orders... The shrimp scew was amazing, that should be a must. But I have to admit that the 5 star-rating is mainly the service, and then the great food. Because I've had better food in the past, but never had faster service outside fastfood restaurants or cafeterias in Hong Kong ;-)And the surroundings are quite nice as well. A very nice experience in a city full of tourist-traps !"
1971,1-09-2016 ,5.0,"Great tapas bar suggested by a local. Get there early or make a reservation because the line is out the door only 20min past opening time. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. Sit at the bar if you want to watch the show or get a table for an intimate dinner. Creative dessert menu, bread pudding is there speciality for dessert. Affordable price. Thank me later ;)"
1972,1-09-2016 ,5.0,Situated at the top of Las Ramblas this is a lovely restaurant offering full breakfast pastries and a huge selection of tapas. We went three times during our holiday. Staff very friendly.
1973,31-08-2016 ,5.0,"We went here following s couple of recommendations and were not disappointedYou cannot book but there is plenty of opportunity to have a drink and people watch whilst you have a short waitThe food is excellent and would recommend the calamari, salt cod and prawn skewers...,but really it was all goodFriendly staff and generous measures of G&T"
1974,31-08-2016 ,5.0,"Tip: place gets maniacally busy in the evenings, book early; some of the best dishes finish early too, come for brunch."
1975,31-08-2016 ,1.0,"Seafood salad no lettuce or any form of salad, sums this place up.So unhealthy it is ridiculous, everything comes with bread, where are the health parts Avoid, avoid, avoid"
1976,31-08-2016 ,4.0,Probably the best tapas we had in our week long stay in Barcelona. We got put off my the queue the first time we went in but decided to go back a couple of days later and put our name on the waiting list for a table. So glad we did :) The food here was amazing and so much variety on the menu.
1977,31-08-2016 ,5.0,"This is one of reacommdable restaurant in Barcelona. If you visit them, please come before 7 pm at least. In this case you do not need to wait long queue."
1978,30-08-2016 ,5.0,A group of 5 (4 adults and a 2 year old) of us visited early on a Sunday evening! This place is extremely popular with queues a common sight. Within 10 minutes or so we were allocated one of the large tables outside. The service could be deemed somewhat aggressive but nonetheless effective. If you look beyond this and just focus on the food it's without doubt some of the best tapas you will find in the city. Every dish we had was fresh and prepared to perfection. The squid and calamari dishes were a standout. This place has a great vibe and certainly somewhere I'd return to again and again! 
1979,30-08-2016 ,5.0,"The place is packed ! but once you are Inside and choosing your tapas, you understand why. Very large choice, very fresh food.The atmospher is very friendly, the staff very helpful and when the waiters heard it was my birthday, they even lit a candle on our cakes. It was indeed a fantastic evening.You may have to wait to get in, but it's worth it !!!!"
1980,30-08-2016 ,5.0,"This is the best tapas place i've been to in Barca, even though it's in a tourist area.Best thing about it is that you can see how everything looks before you order it.Trust me, you'll want a portion of everything :)A must go if you're in Barca! "
1981,30-08-2016 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana it's a classic tapas and montaditos restaurant that you find all over Spain.The good in this one it's the quality of the food mixed with being one of the most traditional places to eat in Barcelona.When you arrive ask for a table and they will tell you how much time to wait, namely if you want outside.Try ""Clara limon) if you like beer with lemon juice, the tortilla de patata which is made on the minute.Some of my favorites are the ""huevos cabreados"" y el montadito de sollomilo con foie gras."
1982,30-08-2016 ,4.0,I have been here before and really like the atmosphere but I feel like its getting more and more crowded. The Tapas here is a must try!
1983,29-08-2016 ,5.0,"Delicious tapas a must try when in Barcelona. Head of house very friendly, and we were seated straight away. Think that we were two people helped.. Waiter was very on the ball, lady that took our order was helpful in suggesting dishes.. Staff are really friendly and great! All the meals were delicious.. "
1984,29-08-2016 ,5.0,"You may have to wait for a table but it's well worth the wait. Really good food, good value and good portion sizes. Great atmosphere "
1985,29-08-2016 ,5.0,"I visited barcelona just for 2 days but i had lunch in catalana twice, in the first day & the second day. Their menus are fantastic and of course addicted. The potato fries with the eggs is the best menu and a must try here. They have fresh seafood, and i couldnt stop eating here! It was like, i want to order this and that, this and that and so on. Catalana always full of guests and maybe you have to wait to have seated here, but it is so worth to try."
1986,29-08-2016 ,2.0,"Overcrowded tapas restaurant. Bad food, bad service. Crowded with tourists. One time experience only. Long lines to be seated and waiters eager for you to finish your bad meal. "
1987,28-08-2016 ,5.0,"You know a place is good when many locals eat there and a lineup build up every night.Recommended by our nearby hotel, this place was fabulous, delicious and very worth it.Our 7 years old was in even with the mini-cheeseburgers, the beef filet to die for and the peach juice!Every bite was to remember, I mean the freshness of seafood, must try the clam,the Olives, the Ham simple delicious.Beside the waiting, I have nothing to complaint about, we returned and had the same experience.A must try."
1988,28-08-2016 ,5.0,We ended up eating here on Thursday we ate outside. The food was very tasteful and the presentation was great. Also our server was great he did not rush us and he explained everything they had. There deserts were also great and a big choice to pick from. They also brought out the teas in this long packet and you can pick out which ones you want there tea was great.I liked everything about this place the food the atmosphere and also the price I would recommend going here if you had a chance 
1989,28-08-2016 ,4.0,"As you cannot book a table at the Catalana, getting a table can be a bit of a bun fight, but stick with it because the food is worth itTapas with little twists make this a foodies delight.To many great dishes to mention and make sure you leave a space to try the desertsWell worth the wait ..."
1990,27-08-2016 ,4.0,"It is certainly worth waiting almost an hour to be seated in this restaurant. The variety of dishes, the way they are all served fresh and well presented and above all very tasty makes it a pleasure for the pallet...The freshly fried baby squid, the shrimps on the skewer, the grilled vegetables with Iberian ham, the small fried fish with hot peppers, were all excellent. The white Spanish wine we chose was also very good and the sweets were amazing. I adored the carrot cake, but also the chocolate cake and crema Catalana my friends ordered were also delicious.The head waiter was very helpful in assisting us to chose what we wanted. The only problem was when paying the bill one of the waiters "" forgot"" to bring the change and upon our request justified himself saying he forgot the amount we had given him. So be careful when you pay cash!!Otherwise it was an excellent evening!"
1991,27-08-2016 ,5.0,"Amazing food, very reasonable prices and friendly personnel with very good command of english. Highly recommended, central location"
1992,26-08-2016 ,3.0,"Beautiful modern interior, nice sidewalk seating however the tapas doesn't stand up to what you expect from such a striking décor. Mediocre tapas, though they do their best to offer some new dishes not seen on every tapas menu in the city. Wait staff is more attentive than most in Barcelona, though the menu does not do much help, nor the staff for non-Spanish speakers. Found so many more places of better quality in Barcelona. Prices seemed high for what they were able to deliver."
1993,26-08-2016 ,5.0,"We were prepared for this to be a costly meal but given the amazing reviews wanted to try it out. However cost was not huge but bear in mind that it was just a light meal (5-6 tapas followed by desserts for 4 people). I would return again because overall, given the service, menu, and atmosphere, 51 euros was worth it."
1994,25-08-2016 ,5.0,"Food delicious, staff friendly, helpful and courteous, great wine list, hope to try the beers next time."
1995,24-08-2016 ,4.0,If you want Tapas on La Rambla at good value then this is the spot. It's good for families and the service is quite fast. It looks unassuming from the outside but we ended up eating there at least 3 times for lunch and evening. Our servers were friendly and tried to be efficient. Lots of variety on the menu! Will always stop here when in Barcelona 
1996,24-08-2016 ,5.0,"Fun restaurant to have lunch. The flautas (small baguette sandwiches) are terrific. Suggest the Tuna, Anchovies, Olives flute. The ""la presion"" or draught beer is very good and served at just the right temperature. Try the 3 chocolate dessert; what is great about it besides the flavor and richness is the European style size: quality over quantity."
1997,24-08-2016 ,4.0,"Nice setting, delicious foods, good pricing. For so far the best food we had in Barcelona. Service good be better, so only a 4 star rating..."
1998,24-08-2016 ,3.0,"We went there after hearing great reviews but were sorely disappointed. Waited 30 minutes for a table inside which was ok. The staff however were mostly less than friendly, no effort to provide friendly service. The food was good but certainly not as amazing as expectation had led us to believe. In addition you pay for their reputation, the tapas were at best moderately expensive. I would not go back nor recommend this restaurant."
1999,24-08-2016 ,5.0,"Obviously I haven't eaten at all tapas restaurants but I would struggle to understand how this place could be bettered! We arrived at 7pm on a Sunday evening and had to wait about 30mins for a table indoors. Once seated the menu showed us a range if foods that appeals to the whole group which included fussy teenagers and a vegetarian. Food arrived as the meal progressed and each plate was shared among us. The food was amazing, waiting staff were friendly and the whole atmosphere meant that we felt like we were experiencing the best of Spanish cuisine. "
2000,24-08-2016 ,3.0,Tapas for Germans lolBusy place on La RamblaSat outside to eat and drink Wasnt the best eatery but was recommended to us ..wouldn't go bak Try the markets for real tapas and Spanish delights 
2001,23-08-2016 ,4.0,"I went here for lunch during a day in Barcelona and the food was great! I recommend the 'Eggs Style' which were fantastic. The service was prompt and polite, and everything about the meal was lovely."
2002,23-08-2016 ,4.0,This restaurant is regarded as the best place in Barcelona to get tapas. Let me say that the athmosphere is all but Spanish. It feels a lot like an all-you-can-eat wok restaurant.But they do manage to serve some good tapas for a very reasonable price (4 drinks - 10 tapa platters - 4 desserts for less than 80 euro). The place is also very kid friendly and well suited for groups of friends or families. It might be too loud and open for a romantic evening.
2003,23-08-2016 ,5.0,"Following the reviews for this restaurant, we decided to give it a try for a tapas binge. There are no reservations and the wait time can get significant. By 8:00PM, the wait approached 75 minutes. Tables turn quickly, but the crowd really shows up to eat here.But well worth the wait. Our food was spectacular, and the waiter was super helpful putting together a spread. I still am savoring the grilled pulpo (octopus), the spicy shrimp and the eggplant with ground pork (outstanding). We went all out with a nice rioja and the bill was 60 euro for two.We enjoyed it so much, we went again towards the end of our trip. Loved it."
2004,23-08-2016 ,5.0,I have been living in Barcelona for more than 8 years and this is the best tapas place i have found. They are fast and the quality of the food is amazing. The only thing is you will probably have to wait a bit so it is recommended to go very early or late to find seat easier. Totally worth the wait though.
2005,23-08-2016 ,4.0,"Very nice And delicious tapas. Can recommend this place. Crowded And lot of people, but worth it. You cannot recerve table, but we didn't wait to long, maybe 15-20 min. "
2006,23-08-2016 ,5.0,"Great tapas, excellent service. Have to go with time because there is a waiting list. I went the first time at 6 pm and there was a waiting line of 2 hrs. Then I went on a monday at 11am and it was ok."
2007,22-08-2016 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana has become our traditional breakfast spot. This place offers 4 types of hot and cold bocadillos for breakfast varying daily for a fair price of around 2.5-3 euros including coffee or tea. I rarely get bored of these breakfasts, but when I am I simply asks for a classic croissant or a couple of their brilliant and fresh tapas. When I'm hungry I usually go for tapa de tortilla or huevos cabreados. In the afternoon they have lunches, I didn't really really try ""menu del dia"" but I sometimes go and order takeaway ""arroz del dia""(rice of the day) which also varies day to day from classic paella or fideua to black rice with sepia and risotto with mushrooms.Terrace is usually busy for lunch and dinner, and they don't make reservations so when you go expect that you'd probably have to wait for 30mins to 1 hour to get table. Get yourself in the list and have a drink in the bar just around the corner or better choose another place if you're already hungry.Service is great, bartenders are nice, friendly and attentive, but you have to consider that sometimes it's just impossible to attend everyone at once. They do what they can, try to be patient!"
2008,21-08-2016 ,3.0,"Good food but we had to wait over an hour to get a table! The tapas selection was good but the potats bravas was a real disappointment, it tasted soggy and old...like it was microwaved...atmosphere was good and the food came very quickly! I think the restaurant as gotten abit to busy and popular and have taken short cuts when it comes to the food to get it our quickly so that they can get the table free for oncoming customers! I was a little disappointed after reading all the amazing reviews here on trip advisor' "
2009,21-08-2016 ,4.0,"Very good tapas, great selection! Although a very popular place which means a long wait for a table inside, and longer wait for table outside (over 1 h to get a table outside). A bit expencive iberico ham. Very good service! The Food arrived fast after order. Definently worth a visit, but show up early and be prepared that the tapas are quite small."
2010,21-08-2016 ,1.0,We went in for breakfast and there was one waitress for all approximately 10 groups of people. We sat there for about 10 mins before she approached our table- we asked what breakfast they had and she tossed us a menu. While we were waiting for her to come take our order she barked at the table next to us that they had to move to a 2 top instead of a 4 top be said they get busy and they were only 2!! After waiting so long for her to come and take our order (not even a drink order!) we figured they didn't want our business and left to go next door. 
2011,21-08-2016 ,5.0,"Very delicious food and wine. Something you never forget. If you like seafood, pork, beef or vegetables...everything was perfect. Nice staff."
2012,21-08-2016 ,5.0,"The tapas were divine. Absolutely worth the wait. The patata bravas were the best I've eaten in Spain. Loved everything else too - the calamari, garlic prawns, Iberian ham, Camembert, ALL of their desserts. Will be back! ❤️"
2013,21-08-2016 ,5.0,"It worth waiting (around 1h - 1h30 Saturday evening), it's sooo good! All types of tapas are on the menu: fish, shrimps, meat, ham, patatas bravas, tortilla,... at very reasonable price! All are simply excellent ! "
2014,19-08-2016 ,5.0,"I was about to miss my flight last week just to have one more meal in my favorite restaurant in Barcelona. Huevos Cabreados, Chipirones, Pimientos de Padron, Gambas a la Plancha, Camembert, and the Solomillo de Ternera are just some of my favorite dishes in this lively and always busy place - the list goes on. Keep in mind that you will wait for at least 40min - 1hr to get seated on a table (no phone reservations), unless you are one or two people and want to wait for a chance to get seated at the bar which happens much faster. A definite must, the restaurant has an ideal location close to Passeig de Gracia as well, always lovely and buzzing with people at any time of day and the food is simply tasty! Enjoy :)"
2015,19-08-2016 ,5.0,Best Tapas place you can get in Spain. All what you order will be great. It is a delicious Yummy place
2016,19-08-2016 ,3.0,The tapas is delicious. It's noisy and full of tourists at dinner time. There is separate wait list for inside and outside seating. The service is great. If you don't mind the noise it's worth the wait for dinner. 
2017,18-08-2016 ,5.0,"Super packed casual chic restaurant, with amazing food and atmosphere. No reservations. Waitlist. But well worth the wait."
2018,18-08-2016 ,5.0,"This is by far the best restaurant we visited in Barcelona, the tapas were amazing, the staff very helpful and the setting pleasant. Do remember to book in advance as the waiting line gets very long at the door. "
2019,17-08-2016 ,5.0,"Two thumbs UP! You have to order los huevos cabreaos, las navajas and charcuteria with chorizo catalán queso manchego fuet y jamón ibérico. The thing is, you have to wait for an hour to get a table - my recommendation is to wait nearby and be on time. PS- los huevos cabreaos will have a GREAT impact on you! "
2020,17-08-2016 ,5.0,Enjoyed our lunch here. Tapas were excellent. Place was packed by time we left and standing room only to get in. Follow the locals and you usually do pretty good. No different here. Restaurant service in Europe is spotty at best. You will need to ask for drink refills and ice---often.
2021,17-08-2016 ,4.0,"The food and drinks are fantastic, highly recommend the seafood. Definitely good to go when it's off hours so it's not too busy."
2022,16-08-2016 ,5.0,We have been waiting more than an hour for a table of three people on Monday night... it was SO worth it! Great place and tapas. Simplicity of ever dish makes it fantastic! Loud and happy environment. You have to visit when in Barcelona.
2023,16-08-2016 ,4.0,"Visited again for the third time in 6 months. We had to queue previously but this time, we went for an early brunch at 11 am and simply sauntered in with no queue. Food is simple, fresh and delicious. Their creme Catalan is also very good. Portions are not too big so you can have more variety. Their weak points are the salads - but then again, who goes to a tapas restaurant for salad?"
2024,14-08-2016 ,4.0,"This place is HUGE and ALWAYS full. It is insane. The menu is varied and everybody can find something to eat. The food is good. It is not amazing. But its good, not expensive and the place is fun and full so you enjoy your time. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes. "
2025,13-08-2016 ,5.0,"Best tapas ever!!!!!!!! I lived for 8 months in barcelona and tried many tapas places, this is my favorite. Also if someone comes to visit and you wanna take themTo a good place this is the one! The only bad thing is waiting line and time but it's worth all "
2026,13-08-2016 ,3.0,"Be prepared to wait at least an hour for a table. It is usually fine; you put your name on the list and give you an estimate on how long to wait. Just grab a random place around the corner and grab a drink, and then elbow your way through the crowd when you get back and your name is called.The waiters are generally rude and stressed but you get good tapas fast, but you also feel they want you quickly out of there.All in all - good tapas and massive stress levels.I've been here a gazillion times as this was the place we always are at when on business trips, and you know what you get. High stress, good tapas. :)"
2027,11-08-2016 ,5.0,Worth the wait - great food and atmosphere. Amazing tapas and if you like a pudding you won't be disappointed.
2028,11-08-2016 ,2.0,"We saw a free table, no people waiting, so we sat down. Boy, did we commit a mortal sin. The hostess came at us, and said, as unfriendly as possible ""get away from that table and wait at the counter"". By that point, I wanted to leave, but my friends were really hungry. So we waited. We got an other table, ordered some tapas and drinks. Not a single waiter said/smiled/looked at us while taking or brining our order. The tapas themselves weren't bad, but weren't good either, I've had better in Barcelona, for a lower price. (and with friendlier staff)."
2029,11-08-2016 ,5.0,the food was served very quickly and I was surprised that the tapas there was very filling .because this place is so great the cue is and hour and a half long and they do not receive bookings GO AN HOUR BEFORE AND BE PREPARED TO WALK AROUND THE AREA .I highly recommend the fried white anchovies and the cod skewers .
2030,10-08-2016 ,5.0,"We found this place by searching online for someplace not too far from where we were staying. It's near a cross-avenue with multiple outdoor places available, but a bit more touristic. This place had a mix of locals and tourists and was hopping on a Monday night. In fact, the wait for a table inside, at the tapas bar or a freestanding table, was longer than the wait for a table on the sidewalk. Great range of tapas, including nightly specials. Try anything, depending on your tastes, everything we ate was great, and the food at adjoining tables looked delicious, too."
2031,10-08-2016 ,5.0,One of the best and most varied menu for a tapas bars. Definitely one of our best meals out! Plenty of choice. It's very busy so best to arrive early as a lot of locals visit here too! We arrived about 7pm and people were queuing to get in. 
2032,10-08-2016 ,4.0,"After reading trip advisor reviews we added this to our list of must eats, we understood there would be a wait as many reviewers noted that there is lengthy queues particularly after 7:30pm. First night we tried to visit around 8pm and it was very busy and there was a large group of people standing around the doorway waiting to get in so we went elsewhere. Second attempt we arrived earlier around 7pm and we were told there was a 20 minute wait which we agreed to wait, no sooner we walked outside we were told there was a table available?? Bonus! The food is faultless, tasty, quality and well priced considering the types we ordered. The restaurant is very comfortable staff are attentive and work fast to get you in and out. Overall we left happy but a little disappointed as it feels like a machine feed you and then move on. When we left there was a large queue of people waiting to get in so no doubt its popular. I would suggest go here early enjoy the food its fantastic, if you want a linger on a little maybe go somewhere else where you can enjoy dinner at a little slower rate."
2033,10-08-2016 ,5.0,Lined up out the door all day. You then sit and point at what Tapas you want to eat. All are amazing and the presentation is fabulous. Prices are great and so is the wine. We are there 3 times in two days. 
2034,9-08-2016 ,3.0,"We wait 2 hrs to be sit, because we were 9 people and my father in-law told us it was an excelent restaurant. The tapas were good, very small but not worth at all the waiting time! Staff not friendly!"
2035,9-08-2016 ,5.0,"We - a three pax family- went there after a visit of the casa Batlló and arrived at about 15.00. The place was packed. There is a lady inside at a desk managing the seats. Go there. She will tell you whether there is place and if not she will put you on a list. As soon as it is your turn she will call your name.We were lucky and did not have to wait. The food is divine. We ordered mixed tapas. Plus Small beef pieces on bread (5 of them) and an aubergine with minced meat and cheese. Oh yes ... also some potatoes with two sauces, hot tomato and garlic. Some beers, half a liter of sangria, fanta, two coffees. 75€ which we found adequate. Further down on the right there is also a small bar with only sweets. The staff is extremely friendly and despite the confusion keep very calm. Nice!!!!To put it in a nutshell. A divine place foodwise. When you are close it is definitely worth passing by.... one little black spot is the toilet. The toilets were dirty, the soap was finished and so were the paper towels.We will come back - definitely."
2036,8-08-2016 ,5.0,"Our first real meal in Barcelona was at Cerveceria Catalana. We ate outside, where we were able to watch the hustle bustle of the street and the constant line for the restaurant. Even with somewhat a language barrier the staff went to great lengths to show me what foods could be ordered that were gluten free. Our group of 4 were amazed at how delicious everything was. Yes, somewhat expensive, but after traveling in Spain over 2 weeks we could confirm our first impressions: this restaurant is authentic of great quality and not touristy. And don't forget to order a wine. Fabulous!"
2037,8-08-2016 ,5.0,"Loved this place! My boyfriend and I came there around 7pm and was told it would take 15 minutes to get a table. As we had read lots of great reviews on this place we decided it was worth waiting for that amount of time. But we didn't have to wait that long, it took 3 minutes to get a table! Considering all waitstaff it is not surprising at all. The food service was quick as well, we started out with 'Assorted tapas' as we did not know what to get. And a bottle of wine recommended by the waiter. The dishes - the shrimps were fantastic as well as one other dish I cannot remember the name of, I believe it was deep fried cheese with ham or bacon inside. The green peppers were good too. We had tried the peppers at a different restaurant and those were not good at all. We also had clams, something that I'm not a fan of because of the texture. I tried one and it was ok imo. However my boyfriend loved them! So I suppose it's a matter of preferences :) The last dish on the assorted tapas I still don't know what it was. Something deep friend with no flavor at all.After finishing the tapas we were still not satisfied so we decided to order in more food. We choose the 'Cabreaos' egg style and assorted cheeses. First we got the egg dish and we didn't really know what we'd get so much to our surprise we got a bowl full small french frieds with a red sauce and fried eggs. Our waitress put down the bowl and started to cut the eggs and mix it together with the sauce and fries. It was delicious! And if you like cheese, get the cheese plate! :)When it comes to price we paid around €60 for the both of us and I haven't mentioned the desserts we ordered.Over all it's a great place to visit. I wasn't a fan of all dishes but they were still well-cooked and very fresh and because of that I give Cerveceria Catalana 5 out of 5. "
2038,7-08-2016 ,5.0,"It's worth the money, better reserve ahead if going in the evening. Sunday around 18 they had vacant tables inside/outside, but in the evening/at night one waits for an empty chair by the bar.Good sangria and excellent hot tapas (shrimps, mini hamburgers and frankfurters, steak pieces on a tiny slice of toasted bread, patates braves and fried green peppers). We will return."
2039,7-08-2016 ,5.0,"We just loved it here! The food, the atmosphere , the service - all 10 out of 10! We came here twice during our 3 day break in Barcelona, it was a dining experience unlike any other. "
2040,6-08-2016 ,5.0,The first thing I noticed was the excellent friendly service provided by your front of house manager Teng. He was super pleasant & efficient in doing his job. We were greeted with such a positive attitude on arrival and also when we returned after been added to a waiting list for a table outside. We waited for almost 40 mins for our table but it was worth the wait. The service was speedy and professional. And even though it was super busy the waiters did not make you feel rushed. The value for money was also very good. We had approx 8 tapas and a bottle of wine plus desserts and the bill was €50. I would highly recommend a meal at Cerveceria Catalana 
2041,5-08-2016 ,4.0,"Good place in Barcelona , near our apartment in Rambla Catalunya , good food and excelent service . We will soon"
2042,5-08-2016 ,5.0,"Exceptional restaurant but luckily for you tourists there's a lot of tables available if you go early without a reservation. The Tapas menu is wonderful but they also have a lot of main dishes/plates as well. The Cava by the bottle is priced well and the selection of beers and cocktails is extensive! the servers are friendly but they mean business. you order, you get your food, they leave you alone.the ambiance is incredible though, it feels more like Manhattan inside than Spain, but I don't mean that negatively. It's chic and hip inside. "
2043,4-08-2016 ,5.0,"very popular tapas restaurant, queued out of the door and on the street, still go with friends and have a drink, enjoy the company and then order dishes you know and a few that are new, and enjoy. recommended"
2044,4-08-2016 ,5.0,"Went to this restaurant a couple of times during our stay in Barcelona. In the evening, you may have to queue, but well worth it. Every dish was delicious.....and the waiting staff are really friendly. Had a huge meal for two (with cava/beer) for €68.....great value. Wish they open a restaurant in London!!"
2045,4-08-2016 ,5.0,"Great and recommended restaurant! Cool atmosphere with a most varied tapas dishes. Fresh and tasty dishes . Any attempt of a new dish was a success and was delicious . Even if there is a long queue outside the restaurant , I recommend waiting!"
2046,4-08-2016 ,5.0,The first thing you notice when you come here is that everyone must love this place because of the line.Don't be scared and it is worth the wait.Important is that to get a table you need to talk to the counter inside but the seats in the bar are up for grabs.When you find a seat you look around at the open kitchen you see that quality is everything here and to ridiculously low prices... Heaven.I had 5 Tapas and a glass of Wine for 20 Euro.....This is the best Tapas place I have tried ever.So to all you cruise passangers that like me wonder how to get here....SO EASY.Take the 4 euro transfer bus(both ways price) from outside your ship. The first stop after leaving the pier is at the edge of the famous Ramblas. Get of and now you have a 20 min walk on the famous Ramblas that is fun to see. DON'T stop er for food because you have a better price ahead or take a cab. So follow Ramblas and it you will see that the street after a while turns into a ordinary street. Continue walking and just around a corner it is..... If you didn't write down the street name does not matter...It is the place with a lot of people.
2047,3-08-2016 ,5.0,"Visited with friends on a trip to Barcelona after recommendation from a friend - so pleased we did! Delicious, fresh tapas and great service from the staff. Definitely worth a wander from the main Las Ramblas to find this place and eat here. Muchos gracias! "
2048,3-08-2016 ,5.0,"We visited Cerveseria Catalana, after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. We had been to several tapas bars, and we found them to be a little inconsistent, when it came to quality. Cerveseria has the freshest tapas, with the best crunchiest bread. A great menu selection, with daily specials. It gets really busy at night, so keep in mind you'll have to wait for about 30-45 minutes after putting your name on the list. We weren't very impressed with the servers, it could be that they're very busy?...anyways, not the most attentive service we've received. We recomend the 4 cheese tapa, Crunchy camembert, Mini burger, Lomo tapa, and the razor clams tapa. "
2049,3-08-2016 ,4.0,The queue is quiet long but it compensate with great service and good food. Probably one of the best tapas bar in town and open till late comparing to others. Worth the wait and the visit!
2050,2-08-2016 ,5.0,"We had walked past the line of diners waiting for a table in this packed restaurant a couple of times and were put off by what appeared to be a the long wait. But the search for really good tapas won out and we asked for a table outside (a shorter wait time) we were told 35mins and told to line up along the footpath. Instead we went into the very packed bar and asked for 3 glasses of sangria, ha, we were told ""No glasses of sangria for you, only jugs"" OK we ordered our Jug and poured it into the glasses (exactly 3 glasses) at the bar. Then we kept getting in trouble as my friends backside was over the imaginary line between the bar and the inside dining area (literally by a few inches) but the sangria (almost just straight red wine) worked fast and well and we ended up laughing about this slightly Faulty Towers approach. It was only 10 minutes before we were called and ushered to our table. Our waiter was fantastic and informative suggesting a good selection of tapas, he had a quirky sense of humour, which I imagine would be hard to maintain considering how busy the place was. The other diners mostly travellers were also helpful confirming some of the more unusual dishes were delicious. Our dishes varied from old faves like patatas bravas, cuttlefish, olives, chorizo etc and some like Cabreos Style Egg (runny egg and a tomato sauce on top of tiny crisp hot chips) that I had not tried before, all were perfect, freshly prepared and delicious. We finished off with Catalan creme for desert which rounded off the best tapas I had in Barcelona. Surprisingly enough it was not expensive, food bill came to 51 euro for all 3 of us and we were well satisfied, our JUG of sangria was 15 euro."
2051,2-08-2016 ,1.0,"Took my kids here for dinner. Let them chose 3 tapas. I ordered 1 ""mineral con gas"" water. The bill was $30. It was ridiculous to be charged $9 for a tapas with 2 small shrimp. They labeled it langosta which means lobster. But it was 2 tiny shrimp not even a prawn size. Do not go here! There are so many wonderful tapas places to try. If you are going to dine, ask for the price of everything. They are deceiving on their prices and what is listed on the menu."
2052,2-08-2016 ,3.0,"Traditional tapas, pintxos and spanish food. It is very touristy and usually you have to wait but it's much better choice than others restaurants in the area."
2053,2-08-2016 ,5.0,"The flavors were fantastic. We let our waiter order of us a selection of the the tapas del dia ... and we were not disappointed! The squid, beef and veggies were all cooked to perfection, and seasoning was on point across the board. Don't miss out on this place."
2054,2-08-2016 ,4.0,"We went to find out why so many people reviewed this place. The front area is really busy and happening, then inside in the back area, another atmosphere we liked. We had few seafood and fish, some drinks and then their coffee. In the whole Europe, we prefer their coffee. Perfect blend!"
2055,1-08-2016 ,5.0,Very busy very good. Friendly staff and good options. One of the better and strangely cheaper options in the hood. Explains the wait. Worth multiple visits. 
2056,1-08-2016 ,4.0,"it's not the tipical taperia in Barcelona, here everything is well curate, from the interiors the the plates served. We went there for lunch and we've eaten great food, the service was perfect, fast, efficient and very kind. The price is not cheap but it's in the average of other reataurant, it's always very crowded so take in mind to get earlier than the usual spanish habits"
2057,1-08-2016 ,5.0,"Came here for lunch and had to wait 20 minutes. Expected this though. Atmosphere was really good, plenty of locals in too. Options were reasonable, quite fish based. The food that arrived, quickly after order, was fantastic. Fresh, perfectly cooked, tasted amazing. 7 tapas, 1 desert and a bottle of red for €50. Highlight was the cod skewer. Will certainly visit next time I'm in the city. "
2058,31-07-2016 ,4.0,"Excellent food and service. By far my favourite Tapas / Cerveceria In town. Expect waiting time, but it is worth the waiting."
2059,31-07-2016 ,5.0,"Fantastic food, friendly service. First day in Barcelona, not sure how our first dinner would go with the kids, not speaking the language...servers were so helpful! Everything we ate was so good. Ask questions and you will have a great meal! "
2060,31-07-2016 ,4.0,"We came to the restaurant through word of mouth by a fellow guest at our hotel. The restaurant is a fun place, which was busy yet didn't feel crowded.We asked the waiter for his recommendation for newbies to Barcelona and he recommended the tapas platter from the menu. This list him one star because while the assortment of clams, fried peppers, prawns, ham croquettes and fried sardines were tasty. However, when we looked at the other tables, we saw choices that wee much more compelling. We also ordered the Iberico ham and pork loin, both of which were excellent. The tomato bread was fine. The service was efficient though it could have been friendlier.We ordered dessert and the Catalonian cream was excellent and the red millefeuille was very good.Overall an enjoyable meal that could have been better if the waiter was willing to engage. In any event, we both agreed we'd go back."
2061,31-07-2016 ,5.0,Our first experience for Tapas and we were not disappointed! We let the waitress choose for us and it was all good. Great Sangria too!!! 
2062,30-07-2016 ,4.0,"We had artichocks, méat balles, calamars, And Cheese Plate. Gréât food. Service....eh? Nice local enterai ment....actually boy acrobates from Brazil. Fun open square atmosphère Too many Beggars"
2063,30-07-2016 ,5.0,"Our hotel receptionist recommended this restaurant and while I write this we enjoy our second visit. The atmosphere and food is outstanding and worth the waiting. They don't take reservations so you just go and report yourself at the restaurant. They will take your name and tell you an approximate waiting time. Just go for a drink nearby and return in good time. You will not regret, I promise. Just incredible good food with a fast service by very friendly and professional staff. "
2064,30-07-2016 ,3.0,After reading great reviews about this place we made a long trek to check it out. I guess it was good because it was packed and the queue was long but we were advised that there would be at least an hour wait for a table and there was already a big queue for the bar seats. We asked to book for another day but they didn't take bookings so unfortunately we had to give it a miss. Not recommended for anyone who prefers a relaxed dining experience.
2065,30-07-2016 ,5.0,"Beautiful place with very good tapas. They don't take reservations, which is great for all of us that: 1) forget to made them 2) don't care waiting 20min for a table. Point 2 is not a joke, however you can get a clara (beer+Sprite) and some tapas in the bar while waiting as well walk around in Paseo de Gracia. Almost every time I have visitors from abroad I bring them there and it is always a good time. "
2066,29-07-2016 ,5.0,The Concierge at the Majestic Hotel where we were staying recommended this hipster spot. The atmosphere is a cool vibe and the clientele follows suit. We tried the chicken croquettes which were the best I had the entire 2-weeks I was in Barcelona and Mallorca. The rose wine was a perfect pairing. We hit this place around 530pm just before it got crowded and were able to squeeze into the small bar. Wouldn't have minded spending more time there but we were on route home before a dinner rez at 9pm. The other patrons food looked good but I didn't have it so I cannot say for sure.
2067,29-07-2016 ,5.0,"After taking in shopping and a nice stroll form Placa Catalunya up Passeig de Gracia, a quick left on Carrer de Mallorca and you get to Cerveceria. Not sure it is possible to not wait in line here, but is is well worth it...from the bread to the octopus to the sausage, every tapas here was excellent. Matched well with Estrella on draught and you have enough strength to continue your walking tour of Eixample."
2068,29-07-2016 ,5.0,We arrived early but a big queue. They took our name and said about 45 minutes. Went to a nearby bar for a drink and came back at the appointed time. Five minute who and the friendly staff served up some excellent and well priced tapas. If I were staying longer would go back.
2069,29-07-2016 ,5.0,Always crowded but worth the wait. Once you have your table you get a fast service. Can choose from a big assortment of tapas. My favorite is the eggs with potatoes. However there are hundreds of options. Dont miss it. 
2070,28-07-2016 ,5.0,"We stayed down the street from this restaurant and thanks to TripAdvisor found it when searching for 'Near me now'. If you go early for dinner around 6 there wont be as much of a line as there is the rest of the day. But the line is worth it, all these crowds are there for a reason. Everything we tried was great, service was great and very helpful as we didnt understand everything on the menu. They made some suggestions and we loved everything, even my kids were happy with the food. We ate here 2x in 3 days. Very reasonably priced."
2071,27-07-2016 ,4.0,Quick service! The food was delicious! You must try the grilled baby calamari! Amazing! The sauce on the razor clams was so good and they were cooked to perfection!
2072,27-07-2016 ,5.0,"We were recommended to visit this place by friends and they were so right about recommending us. For several days I was eating tapas twice a day, lunch and dinner. We tried many places, yet Cerveceria Catalana had the best overall food. Many tapas places have the same food so the differentiator is the taste and service. and CC covered them both. Try the dish that has the eggs over fries/pasta....amazing. We were lucky to sit outside once, after that we would walk by on our way back to our apartment and it was crowded everyday. Expect a wait, or show up at off hours."
2073,27-07-2016 ,4.0,"Recent visit to Barcelona, with a must return visit to this great Tapas venue. Good choice, good quality and reasonably priced! Great atmosphere too - first come first served approach, no reservations taken. So just be prepared to wait for a table if your arriving after 7.00pm and around 9.00pm onwards it's very very busy - but well worth the wait!!"
2074,27-07-2016 ,1.0,"As I was dining at the tapas bar the first cockroach came and I told the waiter (calmly) and asked him to talk to manger to help us relocate . Then a second ands Third cockroach showed . The waiter said he talked to his manager and waiting to see what he will . We dined for about 1.5 hr, the manger never came to us to apologize or said anything. Did absolutely NOTHING. And charged us full bill as well."
2075,27-07-2016 ,3.0,"Maybe I had a bad day compared to everyone else rating C. Catalana, but I really didnt find this particular good. It wasnt bad at all, but from what I heard and read elsewhere it was supposed to be ""IT"" A huges restaurant loaded with tourist and waiters that werent on. But besides the many guest I dont think the restaurant had any soul. Have to try it again, but have a feeling I will not find it better. "
2076,26-07-2016 ,5.0,"This was our favorite restaurant in Barcelona. Incredible tapas! We couldn't stop eating, and prices were so reasonable. Went there three times! It's a hopping place with folks who love to eat! While we waited, we enjoyed the delicious sangria and more tapas. Get there by 7 PM or plan to wait awhile."
2077,26-07-2016 ,5.0,We love the variety and quality.. its pleasure to be here. Bassuma and Malek loved the menu.... they r 9 years old. So we did.
2078,26-07-2016 ,5.0,It represents a typical Spanish Bar of Eat and Drink. Its a good version of the cultural habit and serves large verities of cold and hot tapas. Drinks are of a large choice too. Always busy and may require 15-30 minutes waiting time to be seated. Mu wife and myself tried it once and went again the second day. 
2079,25-07-2016 ,5.0,"Can't beat sitting and eating everything you want at the finest Tapas bar I have found.Friendly atmosphere, sit and chat with the person next to you as we did before the smart phones. "
2080,25-07-2016 ,5.0,Great tapas for a normaal price and authentic being in the middle of all these toerist resto's.We will probably visit them again during our 5 day stay.
2081,25-07-2016 ,4.0,"when you first arrive it's a waiting list for half an hour to an hour depending on when you get there, that is if you want to sit in the restaurant, otherwise you can just take a free seat in the bar if there is any, without the waiting list. when we finally got seated the service was really quick and the food was amazing, also nice portion sizes, the price is very good aswell. their sangria is the best sangria we've had and as i mentioned, the tapas is great. defininately worth the wait. so good that we came back a second time."
2082,25-07-2016 ,5.0,"We had such a good meal at this restaurant, and went to go back the next day, and it was too crowded with people waiting. Excellent Tapas"
2083,25-07-2016 ,4.0,We waited about 40 minutes for a table inside but it was worth the wait. There was a really wide selection of tapas on the menu. Our waiter was very helpful with making suggestions for us. Very good value for a memorable meal.
2084,25-07-2016 ,5.0,"They don't accept reservation and very crowded. Worth to wait in line. Amazing tapas. Never leave barcelona without visiting this restaurant. Try salmon tapas, baby calamari, crab salad. "
2085,24-07-2016 ,5.0,We went there for lunch and didn't have a reservation. Had to wait for 20 minutes which went by quickly as we left and did some window shopping in the area. Food was really delicious and service was super efficient. Everything was good but my favourite were the clams and the mushroom asparagus. Will definitely go there next time I'm in Barcelona. 
2086,24-07-2016 ,5.0,Very close to doubletree hotel in heart of the action. My first time trying good in Barcelona and we loved it. It first get packed until about 7pm
2087,24-07-2016 ,4.0,"A very busy bar/restaurant of a kind which is two a penny in Barcelona, mostly with disappointing results, but this place is in a different class. Lots of tapas and pinchos to view at the counter, many very appetising and many to be taken off and cooked fresh, which is exceptional. We went at a quiet time but even allowing for this we were treated superbly well by the mostly Filipino staff, who explained everything to us with endless patience. And for what you get it’s very cheap."
2088,24-07-2016 ,5.0,"We ate here recently due to the positive reviews we read on Trip Advisor and really enjoyed the experience. We arrived around 6 on a Friday evening and had no problem getting a seat at the bar. Pretty much everything we ordered was delicious but I'd particularly recommend the croquetas, mini burgers and the prawn skewers. I know people have described it as a traditional tapas bar but I actually thought it was a bit more formal than that, as the food had a level of complexity and was presented more decoratively than the traditional tapas. The atmosphere was ok, certainly not bustling but The food was really excellent and it's for that reason that I'd recommend you visit Cervececeria Catalana. "
2089,23-07-2016 ,3.0,"Our expectations were high based on what we have heard of this restaurant. We came Saturday July 23rd at 18:30, the outside tables werd all occupied but we were lucky to get a table inside, the restaurant was full. We ordered a tapas assortment. Whikd witing fir that we ordered tomato bread. The portion given to us had however some extra topping; a lot of human hair, and the waiter did not even notice. Not a good first impression. The tapas was however tasteful. We ordered actually some more having eaten the assortment. The invoice was € 39, 70 with two large beers."
2090,23-07-2016 ,5.0,"What a great place to have a tinto de verano and tapas. They have all kind of great tapas. Try the bocadillos w Brie, dates and tocineta. It is delicious. We went there for dinner and breakfast. This place is very close to the Barcelona center hotel and grand via. It is a place where you see tourist as well as locals Highly recommend it. "
2091,23-07-2016 ,5.0,"We ate and ate until we were uncomfortable from over eating. The food was delicious and quick coming out. Try to get a table outside to take in the great Barcelona atmosphere. We ordered a load of tapas and had a bottle of wine, and it all came to €34. Amazing deal for what you get! "
2092,23-07-2016 ,5.0,"A friend had recommended this place so we had to try it. It did not disappoint. It was truly amazing. Probably the best tapas we had in Barcelona. We had 6/7 different tapas, coffee, dessert plus a bottle of wine and we spent less than we did in any restaurant in Barcelona. Place was jam packed but service was excellent."
2093,23-07-2016 ,4.0,"The food in this restaurant is really tasty, really hot and freshly prepared and cooked. The flavours and variety of dishes available is fantastic. Variety of cold meats and cheeses is great. We went there 2 nights running because it was so good the first night, however the second time was more disappointing as we felt that we were being rushed out again. We didn't get 5 minutes to look at the menu before the waitress was trying to take our order and food was arriving almost before we had time to sit down. The restaurant is extremely busy and very popular with locals as well as tourists, but they could slow down a little in the beginning of the meal."
2094,23-07-2016 ,4.0,Went there twice in my vacation and enjoyed both times. We got really good ham and tapas dishes. The service was good (though not fantastic) and the atmosphere nice. Seems to be busy so I would recommend to book in advance on the busiest times.
2095,22-07-2016 ,4.0,Nice spot....good food but crowded- volume/in-out...and the small plates $ add up quickly... no reservations and you may have to wait.... tapas knowledge (selections) beforehand would be advised...
2096,22-07-2016 ,2.0,"We went there for tapas after reading the reviews of this place and I was pretty disappointed. We sat at the bar and had patatas bravas, some other kind of potatoes with eggs (with waiter's recommendation) and fried calamares. Everything was very dry and did not taste much. Calamares were also chewy. The waiters by the bar were constantly discussing the customers who were sitting around which made the atmosphere pretty unpleasant. I would not go back to this restaurent. "
2097,21-07-2016 ,5.0,Good service as always and good food. The problem that you need to wait at least 30m and it is always like that. It is the best place but you must to wait!!! 
2098,21-07-2016 ,4.0,"This place was recommended to me by a friend and it lived up to his description. He mentioned that it was always crowded so I tried to make a reservation but they didn't take them. At 7pm on a Wednesday night the restaurant was already full and a crowd was standing outside with a 20 minute wait for a table of 4. When we got there at 10:30pm the wait had increased to 1hr. We put our name on the list (they don't take numbers for call back so you have to be there) and then walked to check out Casa Batllo Gaudi as it is nice to see at night and close to the restaurant. We then walked back and checked in so they knew we were still there. We probably only waited a total of 30mins before getting seated as if you are not there when they call you they move on to the next name on the list. Once seated, the food did not disappoint. We ordered a ton of different things to share and then continued to order more as we finished. The waiters were really friendly and helpful in giving advice on what to try. The pitcher of sangria was very well priced for the size we got (15.60€). We did not feel rushed at all which was very nice as I was with friends visiting from NYC and wanted to catch up and relax. The overall cost was around 23€ per person. I thought it was going to be a lot more based on what we ordered. This turned out to be one of the best meals I had so far. I will defiantly be back as it was well worth the wait. They have menus in English and the staff also speaks it. Sadly there is no WiFi but with the amount of people there wanting to connect it probably wouldn't work even if they did have it. "
2099,20-07-2016 ,2.0,"We tried to get in here 3 times but the queues were huge. We tried one final time on our way back to the airport so arrived at 6pm and were thrilled that there were no queues. We sat down and ordered drinks and food, but throughout the whole visit, not one member of staff smiled or made us feel welcome. We would have left but didn't have time before we had to catch the train. We had so looked forward to it but were really let down. Vinitus and Tapas 24 anyday."
2100,20-07-2016 ,5.0,"So rarely do you go to a restaurant that has excellent service matching superb food! We had spent the day exploring Barcelona and by 7 pm were ravenous! We got there and were immediately seated, though shortly after the que was getting very long !! Some of the fish dishes had already run out, which was a shame but there was still plenty to try ! All their tapas was great, every single plate! The goats cheese with peppers and fried camembert was a particular highlight for me ! The waiting staff were superb - so friendly and service was prompt! Leave room for dessert- they are just as tasty ! Don't miss this place, it is a must ! "
2101,19-07-2016 ,4.0,Been there many time. Always good. Quality food at resonable price. Service is good and they open until 1h30 am!! Very recommendable
2102,19-07-2016 ,5.0,"My husband and I had a short visit in Barcelona visiting my older brother after 17 years without see him. We decided to invite him to the restaurant he enjoyed most and it was Cerveceria Catalana. This place is great with a nice ambience and lot of people. Usually need to wait to be seated around 15-20 minutes . I don't think we wait more than 5 when we were seated at the bar with a coke zero. We were really hungry thinking this will be not enough as a dinner for two canadiens. The variety is enormous and delicious . Love the calamares, croquetas, jamom Serrano and others with steak OMG yummy yummy! We just ate and ate and ate and finally we were full! Each one Tastes better than the next one ! The prices are reasonable( please don't convert Euros to yours currency) . Also have a variety of desserts to die for . It's a crowd place with happy people and excellent service ! I wish be there again to come back and enjoy the best tapas in Barcelona"
2103,19-07-2016 ,5.0,"if you are looking for a great place to eat, the best service and relaxed atmosphere, this is the place.the only concern is that after 7PM the place is fully occupied and you might need to wait awhile.after two times that we had to wait ~an hour, we came at 6PM and had the best tapas experience.definatelly a place you have to be in Barcelona."
2104,19-07-2016 ,2.0,"I have been coming for many years at the Catalana for their very good tapas. The places has transformed from a ""local"" place to a tourist place - but have continued to serve good tapas. I was in Barcelona in May 2016 and again in July 2016 and it has just become too much of a hazzle in my opinion to get a seat."
2105,18-07-2016 ,3.0,"The place is always busy, non-stop.. From tourist to locals. We ordered bravas, which was too oily, padron a rate of 5/10, manchego cheese without quality, grilled mushrooms cook without passion, fried calamar, . Of course the drink, we ordered water which the lady with braises dont even the care to open it. White wine, no choice and question from the lady, she just brought a raimat. The service is a horrible. Just happend near our table as well. Don't be fooled by the people coming in. There are good and better tapas bar within the vicinity."
2106,18-07-2016 ,5.0,"Cervecería Catalana is a great place for tapas. There is always a line full of tourists and locals. During our stay in Barcelona, we decided to go for tapas at 3:00 pm , it was less crowded, but we still had to give our name to the receptionist. The wait was approximately 15 minutes. The food was exquisite and the service was excellent. We tried several tapas , salads, ham , squid, delicious bread with tomatoes, croquetas, crema Catalana and a pitcher of refreshing sangria. You will not regret the visit. Moderate prices. Good quality tapas."
2107,18-07-2016 ,5.0,"While in Barcelona from July 6-11, my wife and I ate at the Cerveceria Catalana twice. Both times the food and drinks were excellent. The restaurant was packed both times we went and we had to wait to get a seat at the bar, but it was well worth it. They had an excellent variety of tapas and the beer, sangria and wine were all good. If you are in Barcelona you should definitely eat there and I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
2108,18-07-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant is amazing. It was packed both times I went to (on a Monday night at 11pm and Thursday night at 11.30pm,) but they have open seating at the bar so I didn't have to wait too long to get a seat. The seafood was very fresh, the most fresh in any restaurants I ate at in Barcelona. First time, I ordered assorted tapas, which came with shrimps, mussels, clams, fried peppers, and croquettes. The second time I ordered Cabreaos Eggs Style after seeing someone eating the first time. Both time the food was amazing. The service was very good as well. The hostesses were very courteous and attentive. The staff at the bar was very helpful, even though some of them don't speak much English, as well as attentive as they checked up on me often. Overall, a great experience and the price is very reasonable. I only paid 11 euros (not including tips) for a plate of tapa, salad, and a bottle of beer!"
2109,17-07-2016 ,3.0,We had around 6 tapas here but nothing actually gave us a WOAH only the boiled cold shrimp was good. There was a Pincho dish with 'crab meat' and a shrimp and pickle on top ----don't order it !!!!They made it with crab sticks not real crab and mixed it with corn and mayo. We don't mind the long wait (1.30 hrs) but for the food quality really doesn't worth it. We felt the pressure from the manager as he kept asking the server to ask us what we want more like 5 times within 40mins. Servers don't smile here I think they work under great pressure.
2110,17-07-2016 ,4.0,We did queue and they are pretty organised to help you get a table but a seat at the bar worth waiting for. Good choice of half bottles and lots of help from people around us on what was good . Stayed for three hours!
2111,17-07-2016 ,5.0,Everything we ate was amazing and delicious. Staff was very helpful. They helped us what to choose from the menu and explained everything. Also the atmosphere was great.
2112,17-07-2016 ,5.0,Absolutely amazing tapas! Great service... The place was packed with people so we had to wait a bit to get seated but not more than 10minutes. The ambiance is nice and trendy.My favourite was the fried Camembert... I definitely had a moment there:) We chose this place as it was recommended by a friend living in Barcelona.
2113,16-07-2016 ,5.0,No need to write more than - just awesome - a must try in BarcelonaCome early though as it is really busy starting around 6 PM in the weekends 
2114,16-07-2016 ,4.0,A large number of different tapas. They are really good. It's difficult to find a table but it's worth it. You can enjoy at the bar as well. 
2115,16-07-2016 ,5.0,"Cerveseria Catalana had been recomended to us long before we reached our holiday destination this Summer, so we had our expectations...we didn´t see eye to eye at first, the waiter and I, but soon, after assessing the circumstances and a bit of diplomacy, we went for the real important staff, and that was, having a most pleasurable experience by tasting some of the best tapas in town! Really recommended."
2116,16-07-2016 ,5.0,"This place deserves an even higher rating. Extensive selection of traditional tapas and nice choice of beers, all at a very reasonable place. Seating at tables and the bar, with long waits in prime hours. "
2117,14-07-2016 ,4.0,"We went to Cerveceria Catalana with a group of friends and had tapas. The food and sangria was ridiculously delicious. We hadn't booked so there was an hour wait (which ended up being an hour and 40mins) so I would suggest booking if they accept them! Other than that I couldn't fault the food, service or atmosphere. A great restaurant and easy location to get to wherever you're staying. "
2118,14-07-2016 ,5.0,"We sat at the bar and enjoyed getting to try several tapas along with a bottle of cava. The cuttlefish was particularly good. The roasted vegetables were also amazing. This place gets crowded, so don't try to go at peak hours."
2119,14-07-2016 ,5.0,"Had a meal here with my family. Really good tapas bar, kid friendly. Great selection, nicely cooked and tasty. Yummy sangria. Staff very good, really busy but we got a table for five virtually immediately. Definitely up there with the best."
2120,14-07-2016 ,5.0,"Hands down, best meal we had in Barcelona. Well worth the hour wait to grab a table. Everything fresh and full of flavour, and really cheap. Must Go!!!!!"
2121,14-07-2016 ,4.0,"Excellent.Despite a waiting time which will often be long, the food is excellent. Traditional tapas. Vegetarians will also find their happiness. Avoid the menu except for the tapas of the day and go choose to the counter. The Huevos Caballos is a killer."
2122,13-07-2016 ,5.0,"I had a wonderful experience here at lunch time, although I must say I was lucky to have been seated very quickly given the crowd. My advice is to be adventurous, and perhaps even have your waiter select an array of dishes for you - regardless, you can't go wrong. This said, I would strongly recommend the beef tenderloin montadito, assorted tapas, and any daily special that might appeal to your particular taste. I was only in Barcelona for 24 hours, but if it gets much better than this, I'd be impressed."
2123,13-07-2016 ,3.0,"We came here on a Sunday afternoon, supposedly off peak hours but with our party of 9, we still had to wait about 30min. It's a very popular restaurant and doesn't take reservation. Friends we were with really enjoyed their meal here last year and hence, wanted to return to this place. The menu has a good variety of tapas and desserts. We ordered a number of different tapas - both warm and cold - as well as desserts. Overall, while still delicious, we found the food to be better at La Flauta (another tapas restaurant belonging to the same chain as Catalana). Our friends also felt that the food seemed to have tasted better last year. Perhaps there was another chef or it was just an off day. Nevertheless, this place was still better than average. "
2124,12-07-2016 ,5.0,"You know when you go to a city and there are some things you HAVE to do? the cerveceria catalana is one of those in Barcelona. We've arrived early (around 6:30 pm) so we immediately got a table. The waiters are very friendly, the tapas and pinchos are delicious (and they have a large list of ""tapas of the day"" which are not always on the menu), the sangria the cava is perfect, and the price is more than honest. And the sweet tapas, my god!!! I enthusiastically recommend."
2125,12-07-2016 ,5.0,We stopped by here after a long day of sightseeing for some tapas for dinner. We actually got the recommendation from a couple of locals on the street. We were told that there would be a 15 minute wait but we were seated within 5 minutes. Then all the food we ordered came out really quickly. The waitstaff was friendly and the ambiance of the place was great. Would definitely come here again. 
2126,12-07-2016 ,4.0,"We went to this place, because of the Tripadvisor recommendation. It was quite busy and crowded. However, the tapas were outstanding. I ordered Gambas al Ajillo (Grilled shrimps with garlic) and Tortilla (Spanish omelette) and both were very delicious. Also, there was a great selection of beers."
2127,12-07-2016 ,5.0,Came here following good reviews on tripadvisor and it exceeded our expectations. Although it was a very busy restaurant (on a Monday evening) we were able to get a table in a relatively short time. The service was impeccable all throughout the night and every dish we tried was amazing. I would recommend the prawn skewers and beef tenderloin. An experience to remember. 
2128,12-07-2016 ,5.0,"We arrived in Barcelona at 2pm, after.our flight was.delayed for several reasons and we were starving. Our Hotel concierge addressed us T the Cerveceria Catalana, close to.Passeig de Gracia. It was a hot day and when we got there we found many.people standing and waiting to.be seated.We were not optimistic, but the lady.at the desk.told us it was only a 20'minutes wait, and.we could either book to be seated and wait for anybody to finish at the bar and replace them on the stools, whichever happened first. We ended up at the bar, where tapas were served, but the call to be seated was made in 20 minutes. The food was just excellent, we had tapas with jamon (ham), tapas with three types of melted cheese, tapas with jamon and pimiento (pepper), with salad.We also tried a very fresh salad with shrimps, and a plate called huevos.cabreaos based on eggs mixed with potatoes and a spicy sauce.Fresh tap beer and a dessert made of three layers of chocolates made our day perfect.What a start for our vacation!Service was fast, kind, professional, even when the restaurant was overwhelmed by the crowd.Price was reasonable, we will definitively go back!"
2129,12-07-2016 ,5.0,"Three friends and I are visiting Barcelona and came in on a Monday night around 8:30 and the wait was 40-50 minutes. We were pleased with every dish we tried! The Iberian ham, huevos cabreaos, crispy Camembert, razor clams, gambas de ajillo, and fried cuttlefish were all amazing and the patatas bravas and asparagus and mushrooms were also very good. Would definitely recommend trying this place, but the one negative of our experience was that service was not very good. Our waiter was not very friendly and didn't give any recommendations when we asked. "
2130,11-07-2016 ,5.0,"You will never fail hereSince years best quality and variety of tapasNot cheap but for what you get, not expensive at allBest is the small solomilloAnd; don't wait for a tableYou need only a place at the bar to order :/)))"
2131,11-07-2016 ,4.0,"The Iberian ham starter in particular was amazing, busy street when sat outside. Long queues so make sure you book or arrive early."
2132,11-07-2016 ,5.0,"Reasonably priced with amazingly cheap and high quality house wine. Minimal adequate decoration. Prawn skewers, beef tenderloin, Huevos cabreaos and warm chorizo flautas are definitely their top dishes. If I had the option to live inside a restaurant I'd definitely move here."
2133,11-07-2016 ,4.0,"They make good tapas and sangria, that's for sure. Not fantastic tho. The service is good. The prices are reasonable. If you want to wait on a queue for at least an hour on a busy day, I would say you should try this restaurant.They have the exact same menu with Ciudad Comdal, if you've been to any of the two, don't go to the other, like we did :)"
2134,10-07-2016 ,5.0,My sister and I went to this place allmost every Night When we were in Barca. We Got the BEST service sitting i the bar instead of wating for a table. The food was incredible and the waiter took very good Care of us and helped us Pick out the Best tapas and monteditos del dia. Prices are very resonably. Go there and Eat in the bar....
2135,10-07-2016 ,5.0,This Is the BEST restaurant we have eaten at on our holiday! It's a MUST to come here when visiting Barcelona!! William got a table outside after 20minutes despite being told the wait would be an hour. The sangria and food are seriously out of this world amazing. My husband is a major foodie and has eaten in some top restaurants and be really rated this place. Tapas are fun and produce is great! This place is totally worth the wait!!
2136,10-07-2016 ,4.0,"Although this restaurant is in a pretty touristy area, it is definitely not a tourist trap. The food is presented very nicely, is very tasty, and the service is very good. It is smart to come here before 8 pm, when you can get a table without waiting that long. Some dishes that were very good are the grilled cuttlefish, the sardines, and the Spanish omlette sandwich."
2137,10-07-2016 ,4.0,"The good - Beautiful ultra-modern decor, really good food, extensive menu, very fast efficient service.The downside - This restaurant caters to tourists, thus it serves their full menu whenever they are open. So no worries about Spanish late eating times. But, we saw few locals here... mostly tourists from outside of Spain. The restaurant is slick and super-computerized, so if you are looking for a warm local feel, this is not your spot."
2138,10-07-2016 ,3.0,Huge restaurant serving simple Spanish food. Very noisy due mainly to the size of the dining room. The service is fast and efficient but not very personal. The food is average.
2139,10-07-2016 ,3.0,If you need to queue for a long time to get a table in an overcrowded restaurant where everything becomes always too complicated you start to avoid the place. That's what happened to me. It looks like their policy is to target tourist that want to have a Tapas experience. But I do not recommend it if you want to enjoy the ride.
2140,9-07-2016 ,1.0,I hate it. We went twice and twice it's so full with 1h waiting time. Hmmm twice walked 30min for free. 
2141,8-07-2016 ,5.0,Brilliant tapas and friendly staff. Very helpful explaining everything to us although the crowd was insanely busy at that time! Will visit again for sure if stopping in Barcelona.
2142,8-07-2016 ,3.0,"We came in to this restaurent with high hopes due to the many postive reviews. We didnt have to wait as we came early, about 5:30. Serving staff were not very friendly and not all that knowledgable on the menu in regards to recommendations and how much to order. The food we ordered came out quick and was fresh but lacked any great flavours. Deserts were tiny and average. During our short stay in barcelona this has been our least favourite dinner to date."
2143,8-07-2016 ,5.0,"My son who lived in Barcelona a few years ago said cerveceria had several locations in Town and they had good quality food at a good price. Couldn't agree more. Lovely restaurant, nice cool AC in the summer heat. The shrimp were amazing. "
2144,8-07-2016 ,5.0,"We have been here a few times and always come back when we are in Barcelona.This is a very typical old-fashioned tapas bar and it never changes. Sitting at the bar is the best way to experience the atmosphere with all the tapas laid out in front of you. A treat for the eyes as well as the stomach!From salads to fish and meat, the choice is fantastic and bill at the end is always a pleasant surprise. We had 4 salads, 6 tapas and 4 drinks and bill was 45 Euro. You just can't beat that in Barcelona for great food and atmosphere.We will be back!"
2145,7-07-2016 ,5.0,"We had a marvelous dinner here, enjoying numerous small plates and excellent Sangria, for a very reasonable price. The restaurant does not take reservations, but the meal is well worth the short wait."
2146,7-07-2016 ,5.0,"Party of 4 pax for early dinner, 8.00pm. The restaurant was not too busy and the service was great. we ordered 4 drinks, 2 entrees to share and 2 mains to share. The staff were very accommodating and courteous. The entrees were prompt, hot and well prepared and very delicious. The mains soon followed and they were also excellent. Not to much but not too little. We all had dessert and coffee. Good value for money."
2147,7-07-2016 ,5.0,We would absolutely go to this tapas house every time we're even remotely close. It's really busy but for a reason. The food is incredible. Have fun 
2148,6-07-2016 ,5.0,"We went to tapas heaven here! I took so many pictures hoping to be able to make the same thing in my kitchen! Nice staff and interesting restaurant. Not right in the center, but nice to walk to. Delicious!"
2149,6-07-2016 ,3.0,"We went there as a large business group, had a set menu of tapas and just ordered drinks.It was not bad, but could not say it was good either. There are many better alternatives in Barcelona."
2150,5-07-2016 ,5.0,"We each had a selection of tapas, maybe ordered more than we needed, as they were so good. As Americans we were there a little bit earlier than the local crowd, which was good, as the place was packed before long. Loved the peppers, and I think most people did as I saw them practically on every table."
2151,5-07-2016 ,4.0,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, good crowd. Service itself was a bit rushed, but I imagine this had to do with an incredibly busy night and impatient patrons waiting to be seated. Food was very, very good, and wine list left little to be desired for."
2152,5-07-2016 ,5.0,Introduced by a friend who stays in Barcelona. Nothing much in service. But food is very good. A bit too touristy though. 
2153,5-07-2016 ,5.0,"The tapas was so good I couldn't stop laughing each time I tried a different dish. All sorts of typical tapas you can find is there. We had the fried potatoes (I loved their red sauce, whatever it was, it made me almost cry), asparagus and mushrooms, Spanish omelet, chicken croquettes, calamari and of course Spanish green peppers. They were all so good and lovely I think I could come everyday. Wasn't that expensive either, around 3-5 euros per tapas. The place was nice, although really crowded (it's really famous!! lol.) The staff were really nice too. Most of them seem to come from Southeast Asia, I don't know why, but they were really nice and helpful. Plus, they have all sorts of drinks and I love Spanish beer (Estrella) lol. Definitely made my evening."
2154,4-07-2016 ,5.0,"If you want to try authentic and delicious tapas, you must go to CERVECERÍA CATALANA. Big variety of delicious tapas. You will have to return to try them all. Opened all day, try not to go on rush hour, it is always full. Does not take reservations, you sign up at the door and when it is your turn... They will call you. Worth wile the wait. Excellent list of wines. "
2155,4-07-2016 ,5.0,I went to Cerveceria Catalana because I saw good reviews about it. The food was so good with typical spanish food. We ordered 4 or 5 tapas and we were completely full. The inconvinience is that it is always full so I would recommend to go in the afternoon.
2156,3-07-2016 ,5.0,"fantastic welcome from a asian lady who spoke many languages, her approach was friendly an proffecional.the food was the best tapas i have ever had such a great selection an so well priced. could not believe how good it was the first time went an had to return three times,it was always consistent. Next time I'm in Barcelona I just have to go again. Well done to the team"
2157,3-07-2016 ,4.0,Crowded place but excellent service and quality. You won't be disappointed with seafood but everything is very well cooked.
2158,2-07-2016 ,5.0,Amazing tapas and sangria. Best potatoes bravas and the Spanish Omlet with sweet onions is awesome. We ate here twice. Both times there was a large crowd of people waiting for a table but don't let that discourage you. We waited less than 10 minutes both times. inside dining area is large and they move people relatively quickly (didn't feel rushed when eating though). Atmosphere is casual and quite lively. 
2159,2-07-2016 ,5.0,"This is an extremely popular spot for tourists, one of the most sought after tapas restaurant in the city ... Be prepare after 8pm to wait from 60min upwards. The tapas are just delicious, you have to order the huevos cabreaos, sepia a la plancha ... And just be adventurous with your order. Go, explore and enjoy. "
2160,2-07-2016 ,5.0,"Packed packed and queues all day .... Best tapas, sangrias and more .... We stopped by the mall for a drink but the wine was so bad we left and headed back to this Catalana! At 3pm the queues were already there but we got seats by the bar which is huge fun! "
2161,1-07-2016 ,5.0,"Because this restaurant is so popular with the locals, waiting time for a table could be 45 minutes to and hour. Recommended by both the hotel and locals."
2162,30-06-2016 ,5.0,We came based on a friend's recommendation but the reviews were very positive. Service and food were both outstanding and the atmosphere was fun. I'd agree with earlier comments about arriving early. It was busy at 8 and there was a large group waiting at 9:30.
2163,30-06-2016 ,5.0,"Had been referred to this restaurant by two different friends, was warned of the long wait, but it was worth every minute. We had an hour wait when we arrived so we went to a place around the corner for a drink, came back and they were ready for us. Tried many tapas and one was better than the next. Dessert was great too. We enjoyed the atmosphere, people were very friendly, sharing opinions about their food. The surprising part was the bill, very reasonably priced. With all the tapas restaurants in Barcelona this was the only one we noticed with a line and now we know why. Excellent."
2164,30-06-2016 ,5.0,"Amazing experience, the best tapas I ever had. The place is massive and you have a choice between tapas or sea food! The crema Catalana OMG! Top! I'll come back for sure. "
2165,29-06-2016 ,4.0,"Delicious food, long wait though and locals seem to walk in and get tables / chairs easily. Perfectly appropriate Barcelona Tapas. Great staff. "
2166,28-06-2016 ,5.0,"Worth waiting, food is really good, so popular with Local and tourism, the waiters here is so nice, highly recommend for their seafoods"
2167,28-06-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel staff, and we were very pleased with the meal. The staff was friendly, and the food was excellent. we had various tapas and all of them were exceptional! We had no trouble landing a table outside and the service was fast and attentive."
2168,28-06-2016 ,2.0,My sister and I heard great things about this restaurant but we're very disappointed in the added salt and oilyness of the food The seafood cocktail is mainly fake processed crab and a few prawns with no flavourThe potatoes were very oilyThe asparagus and mushrooms were extremely salty and oily Very unhealthy choice for tapas
2169,28-06-2016 ,5.0,Ate here twice during our stay in Barcelona. Best to arrive early as it gets busy. Large busy restaurant.
2170,28-06-2016 ,5.0,"The atmosphere was great, food was great, service was great. very elegant place to eat tapas. Definetlly will come again"
2171,27-06-2016 ,5.0,"We were told by friends (who live in Barcelona) that this is THE place to go to; we discovered how popular it was when we arrived (the place was packed and as we were a large group the restaurant had to bend over backwards to accommodate us - which they did. In the end.). So when you get to the address you will see the big queue and realise that yes you are at the right address.The food was fabulous and although we had quite a bit it was not heavy so we did not feel sluggish. The fried cuttlefish and the fish skewer were a delight and the ""Cabreaos"" Eggs Style will complete it nicely.There is no point to say that the beer and wine list are excellent as well, the whole package is faultless. The only thing that you need to do is try and find a quiet period and this way your experience will not be diluted by the wait (for a table etc).Go for it. Read the reviews. This is as close to a safe bet as you will ever get.Great for families, by the way!"
2172,27-06-2016 ,4.0,"Only a 15 wait for a table inside. We had the mixed tapas, mixed salads and mixed charcuterie, which gave us plenty of variety and enough food for 3, but we still squeezed in some dessert."
2173,27-06-2016 ,4.0,"If you want to get to know one of the most famous restaurants in Barcelona you need to bring some time with you. Normally you have to wait for 30-60 minutes before you get a table. But it is worth waiting. The restaurant maybe doesn't have the typical charme but it offers great tapas for an incredibly good price. This location is always full and busy but nevertheless the service is great. Tourists, locals, couples, families, business partners, you can find all kind of people in this restaurant and together with the delicious food it is an experience you shouldn't miss."
2174,26-06-2016 ,5.0,"Never have I had to queue for 90m to get into a restaurant. But I did here.Well worth the wait, although I think i'd have preferred to eat at the ""bar"" rather than the table as it's more fun.Try the weird chips with egg. Sounds odd but tastes great."
2175,26-06-2016 ,4.0,"We had lunch here around 16h00. We arrived at 15h15 and the waiting time for a table was 40 minutes. That's quite normal in Barcelona and it's a sign it's a good place for food.We were 3 and had 3 tapas each, pan con tomate and dessert. 25 euro each.The octopus with gallego sauce was really good.No WiFi"
2176,25-06-2016 ,3.0,"Not the place we expected to find after all the hype on the internet. Bright lights, grumpy staff, chaos and bad sangria. To top it of the A-C was set on freeze. Bread, plate of ham and gamba's where good, though not great as expected.."
2177,25-06-2016 ,5.0,"Went there early-around 7 so got a table easily. However,this place gets very crowded so if you go late,be prepared for a long wait. The Sangria was good. The patties braves were fantastic and unique to this restaurant.We ordered the croquettes, razor clams,mini hamburgers and hot dogs for the kids,beef and the shrimp and calamari which were all very good. However,the fried green peppers were ordinary. All the desserts were fantastic and our server was very helpful. This was our last evening in Barcelona and we were glad we finished our trip with this restaurant."
2178,25-06-2016 ,5.0,"Most of the people there are expats, I know. The queue is reallly loooooong, I know. It's really loud, I know.But the food is so good. It's all worth it. The servers speak good English for the expats and tourists.With all the amazing food in Barcelona, when I came back 6 years later, I went back and was not disappointed."
2179,25-06-2016 ,4.0,Great but Ciudad is better!the modern version of Ciudad Condalpersonally i prefer the authentic Ciudad Condalall tapas are great and the service toothe queue is shorter here in the atmosphere is much younger!
2180,25-06-2016 ,1.0,"The staff is grossly unprofessional and pushy, oily food. We ordered Cabreados eggs and it was nowhere close the real spanish one."
2181,25-06-2016 ,5.0,"This place is amazing, staff very friendly and accommodating. The food is amazing with lots of options to satisfy everyone's taste buds, a must try is the beef tenderloin, I'm not usually a beef person but that was so delicious we ordered another. Everything we tried was delicious and we over ate because the food was just so good. Sangria fabulous. We will sure to be back again. "
2182,24-06-2016 ,1.0,Visited this restaurant at top of las ramblas. Place was empty which was a bad sign staff keep pointing to seats upstairs at window to entice you in. We asked for tapas not too much. As it was not on menu we ate six course they charged us 118 euros for four. One beef was 17.50 euros. The waiter who served us was nowhere to be seen at bill paying time. Place is a rip off photos all over the walls of old celebrities visiting luckily for is we found Julivert Meu which is one street down on right which was brilliant and not pretentious like the above. Do not encourage them or fall for the seat at window routine. Food was poor service was poor wine was poor. Con men
2183,23-06-2016 ,5.0,"This place may be touristy, and the wait may be insane but the food is amazing..... We ended up coming here at least 3 times in our 4.5 days in Madrid (and we ate plenty of good other food but we really loved it here). We had our last dinner here and were told the wait is 1 hour 15 at least, and while normally that would turn me off, we decided to wait. We were seated in about 35 minutes. The tapas are spectacular ... spectacular!!! they mix things up and have specials daily, since our Spanish is not great - I would go to the bar look around and ask our sever about what things were. They were helpful and explained stuff to me. The crispy Camembert was and is our favorite and i miss it daily. At least go check it out if you are in Barcelona, you won't regret it."
2184,23-06-2016 ,5.0,"i didnt do much homework before i got there, just heard people mention its a must go. Then we ordered food according to the servers recommendation, which helps A LOT!! The seafood and beef steak is just awesome, not mention the Sangria and the atmosphere. i would love to go back again!"
2185,22-06-2016 ,4.0,"Molt recomanable. Les tapes són boníssimes. L'únic inconvenient és que sempre t'has d'esperar molt, sense poder fer reserva per telèfon. Highly recommended. Tapas are delicious. The only drawback is that you have to wait very long, unable to reserve by phone."
2186,21-06-2016 ,4.0,"This is a restaurant that is packed every single day, tapas are excellent, great service and facilities. The restaurant has only a few tables outside and inside is huge so there's a separate waiting list for sitting outside or inside. Don't be discouraged if they tell you the waiting time is one hour or so, usually every time we've been accomodated in about half hour and in any way it's worth the wait. The only reason didn't gave it 5 stars it's because only thing we never have liked it's the tomato bread, definitely not one of the best ones but most of the tapas are really good."
2187,21-06-2016 ,5.0,Great place for tapas lovers. Good service and ambient for successful dinner. A must if you are in Barcelona.
2188,21-06-2016 ,4.0,"It was a nice restaurant and the food was delicious; but do not expect to have the best service. The restaurant has a long queue, for 3 persons we were supposed to wait for 40-50 mins. Tapas were delicious and the price is good. Because of the crowd and the rush around you don't understand what you eat and talk..."
2189,21-06-2016 ,3.0,"This restaurant is very popular and offers a good variety of tapas. We ordered 6 different plates, including prawns, cuttlefish, a steak, and mushrooms & asparagus. The food was tasty, but nothing special or that stood out. We didn’t feel the food lived up to all the positive recommendations. The service was spotty, at best. We had to seek out our server on occasion, and he offered nothing in terms of suggestions. For us, the Cervecceria Catalana was not the best tapas restaurant we experienced while in Barcelona."
2190,20-06-2016 ,4.0,"We popped in for a few tasty bites before heading to dinner. They've got really delicious and authentic food here! Got some patatas bravas, some prawns, and a platter of fuet: all were high-quality and well-priced. The service was quick and friendly, too.We sat outside, but the interior seemed like the place to be. Great ambience and decor in there. The place was teeming with locals, so that's always a good sign!Definitely worth a visit or two if you're staying in the area, but don't go out of your way to eat here if you're staying further away: there are plenty of great places in BCN with equally awesome food and atmosphere. "
2191,19-06-2016 ,4.0,"We were at passeig de gracia and looked up for a place to eat. With more than 6 thousand reviews we said to ourselves we can't miss this. We were very lucky because maybe Sunday so didn't have to wait at all although the place was full. Bet clean an nice we ordered like 8 tapas. While tasty and good none was anything special. When they say tapas they mean tapas, ex calamari was around 8 euros there were 8 calamari rings ( some small some big) on the plate. Even the desert is minuscule. However tapas were good, wine was good, desert was good we left happy. . Bill was around 80 euros. "
2192,19-06-2016 ,4.0,"Visited here with my girlfriend while we was on a long weekend funeral to Barcelona. Be prepared to wait as this is such a popular place to go for tapas both with tourists and locals. Food is so fresh, you can really tell the difference from this and the standard restaurants serving tapas, it's the stand out by miles. I rated this four stars because the wait was quite long (30 minutes) but that wasn't really much of a problem when the food came out. I ordered an assortment of tapas dishes whereas my companion ordered the hamburgers (I don't know why) which came out raw (that is the only reason this didn't get 5 stars, from my experience it's 5 but from the whole it has to be 4). Will definitely be visiting here again, just won't be ordering any hamburgers haha. "
2193,19-06-2016 ,5.0,"Every dish we tried was so delicious we wanted to order more from it. But we resisted so that we could try a bigger variety. Reasonably priced, conveniently located, I strongly recommend. "
2194,18-06-2016 ,5.0,Amazing food with daily special tapas must try place but be prepared to wait or come early. Great food for great prices.
2195,17-06-2016 ,5.0,"You will wait anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes but you will not be disappointed...great food, great service and definitely something for everyone even with kids! From the shrimp skewers to the filet the food is amazing and at a very reasonable price. We even found a wonderful bottle of red for under $20 euro. They even have a mini hamburger slider that is out of this world...a must when you visit...we actually dined here twice over a 5 night vacation."
2196,17-06-2016 ,3.0,"This place had been highly recommended and we really enjoy eating tapas in Spain. It was crowded so we sat at the bar and ordered 6 different plates, including boquerones, lomo iberico, jamon iberico, tortilla and shrimp. Everything was ok but nothing was that special. There are so many great places to have tapas in Barcelona that we felt disappointed."
2197,17-06-2016 ,4.0,"One of the best places for tapas in Barcelona. Despite the queue time, it is worth waiting for it and getting there early. All fresh and homemade!!"
2198,16-06-2016 ,5.0,"This place is always full, but we were lucky to get a table outside. The tapas were all excellent! Razor clams, aubergine chips with honey, squid, jamon... all delicious. Good service. Very reasonable price. A must in barcelona! "
2199,16-06-2016 ,5.0,Very impressed with the food. We ordered the assorted platter and it was enough for the 3 of us. We would definitely come back 
2200,16-06-2016 ,5.0,"I had heard about the place so much, so decided to beeline for it in my last trip to Barcelona! Couldn't find my way, so asked a really helpful concierge at the majestic hotel to give us directions! He looked at his watch, saw the time - around 830 pm and said oh no, you're in for a long, long wait, but it is worth it.. Thanks to him, we found the place, were asked to come back in an hour and half! We strolled around the near by eateries and side walk cafes, drank some more sangria and made our way to the place. When we asked a server for recommended dishes, he raised an eyebrow and said 'everything' ... Wow, that's some serious confidence.. Anyway, we ordered a lot of tapas... And sangria.. Everything right from the patatas Bravas to spicy green peppers to the prawn in garlic oil and the smoked salmon was absolutely delectable... Portions are generous and service is seriously gram prix style.. Do no miss the desserts! We came back for more the second day as well.. It was totally worth the wait! "
2201,15-06-2016 ,5.0,"My husband and I ate here after a recommendation from a co-worker. I read the reviews online about the wait and they did not lie! We went on a Saturday evening and there was a huge line for a table. We spotted 2 people leaving the bar, grabbed those seats, and ate dinner at the bar. We tried a ton of different tapas on the menu. One recommendation from reviews online was to try a french fry type of dish with a fried egg on top. It is a MUST! My husband is also not very adventurous so he only got the sliders they have and WOW! They are the BEST sliders! He ordered 4 servings (each order comes with 2) and needless to say, we had no leftovers. MUST try this place if you are in the area!"
2202,15-06-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by staff in our hotel and it was the best we tried in Barcelona. Have visited the restaurant on several occasions and it provides stunning food at great prices. The assorted seafood platter is great.The patatas Bravas are the best I have tried anywhere, sublime. The calamari is excellent. I could list so many of the different tapas options they offer to say how good they are but genuinely everything on the menu that I have tried was superb and so tasty. The desserts are also excellent. The drinks options are varied too. The restaurant does get busy so we did have to wait a little for a table a couple of times but there's a great atmosphere there and this gives a good opportunity to get a drink before food anyway so it's a superb experience from start to finish every time you visit "
2203,15-06-2016 ,4.0,"A good place to have some tapas in a usually crowded environment. Price is ok and service is specially kind. Have some words with the security guy at the entrance, he's very kind too."
2204,14-06-2016 ,5.0,"It was our 2nd trip to Barcelona and we didn't miss a single day at the Cervicería Catalana. The tapas are awesome! They are fresh, tasty and various! You have to go there and experience the ambience! It's a mix of business people who come for lunch, local people like families and of course tourists. It is really a must see! We will come back for sure!"
2205,14-06-2016 ,5.0,"I suggest mixing it up while you are doing Tapas there and do some authentic places like el Vaso de oro , modern hipster ones like: Cerveceria Moritz. But, Cerveceria Catalana is the grand lady of them all. It's worth a wait in line. This place has excellent Tapas, clean and beautiful restaurant feel. It has all the fan favorites. Foodie tip! Make a tapas bucket list before you go or while you are there. We had fun crossing them off and made sure we got to taste a wide variety. "
2206,14-06-2016 ,5.0,We had to wait around an hour for a table but worth the wait. Both the service and staff were amazing. There are so many tapas restaurants in Barcelona but this is by far the best we ate at. A bit off the beaten track and full of locals unlike the tourist trap offerings near La Rambla. Super cheap and super tasty!
2207,14-06-2016 ,5.0,"I ordered the assorted tapa, it was super good!! The prawns and clams were so fresh and sweet, and the sauce definitely enhance the them."
2208,13-06-2016 ,5.0,"Our first night in Barcelona and what an introduction to tapas. This is one good, slick and professional eatery. Perhaps it was because it was Sunday, but we got a quick table and engaged the menu with fervor. Everything was excellent. The prawns, the goats cheese, the 'fried small fish' (whitebait), the egg plant, the calamari - all superb. Perhaps lacking in local 'noise' but nonetheless a great start."
2209,13-06-2016 ,5.0,Went here on the recommendation of a colleague. Loved the selection of tapas. Would highly recommend this place for dinner. 
2210,13-06-2016 ,5.0,"This is the only traditional tapas bar we will go to in Barcelona. What other reviewers said is true - could be the best food in Barcelona. Tapas are displayed on the bar and constantly being renewed due to high turnaround. Also a seafood section, which was very fresh.Location - a block away from Casa Milla, surprised at the non-touristy standard of the place considering its location.Price - surprisingly affordable. It is actually cheap relative to the super quality of food.Staff - this is the star of the experience, the staff felt more like friends than waiters - very patient and always try to make you feel at home, whether you are a tourist or local. This was very obvious in how they politely handle some rowdy guests. 6 stars to the staff!"
2211,12-06-2016 ,5.0,"We wanted to go to a tap restaurant that was not top touristy with more of a restaurant feel so headed to Catalana one night after a recommendation from a friend. We arrived around 9pm and the place was heaving with a 1 and half hour wait! On the second night we went much earlier around 7pm and there was only a 20 minute wait, in which we had some delicious sangria at the bar. After eating the food I probably would have waited for the 1 and half hours after all! All of the fish dishes were delicious and fresh, especially the fish skewers and the cod puree stuffed pepper was to die for! I'd go back just for that. The bill wasn't too bad either for the delicious high quality food that was served. The place was clean and modern and the waiting staff were attentive and helpful. A must!"
2212,12-06-2016 ,3.0,"This place is extremely popular and the food is amazing. We tried to go one evening accepting that we would have to wait for a table. We were told 45 minutes, and 1.5 hours later and loads of locals getting tables instead of us we walked out in fury! Terrible customer service by maitre'd, awful organisation if you want to eat there in the evening. We decided to go back the next day but for a late lunch before our flight. We were seated immediately and served by great staff. Like I said food was amazing but don't go in the evening unless you are prepared to wait and wait and wait, then be treated like crap because you're not local by the maitre'd. They need to sort this out urgently!"
2213,12-06-2016 ,5.0,"I loved this place! Our apartment was a block away and we went there three times for lunch and dinner in five days. The food and service are great. I will miss the andulusian squids, the anchovies, the flan, the razor clams. Yum!"
2214,11-06-2016 ,3.0,"A wide selection of tapas available and tasty. My husband and I really enjoyed the assorted plate (five minis including prawns, clams, and more) and two additional tapas. Together with drinks the bill was a reasonable 34 euros. However what dampened the experience and was the service which was confusing as there were multiple servers, and a bit disheartening as we overheard servers speak in Spanish about their customers. However overall this is tasty food and given the space, good for larger groups and even in busier times. "
2215,10-06-2016 ,5.0,"It can get crowded but we managed to find a good seat when we arrived 12noon. It was also in time when they had their list of daily tapa specials (think of it as your dimsum cart in a Chinese resto). If you have a hard time speaking the local dialect, they have super friendly staff who can make it a breeze. Look for Antonio. Try asking for ""half"" of each serving so you can satisfy your tapa craving.I heard the evenings can get really packed and have long queues."
2216,10-06-2016 ,5.0,My husband and I ate here on two occasions and enjoyed both the food and good service on both visits. The patatas Bravas are out of this world!
2217,10-06-2016 ,4.0,This is a nice tapas restaurant - a beer house. The tapas were nice but the dishes were smaller from what you experience in other restaurants in Barcelona. Still very crowded and tasty...
2218,9-06-2016 ,5.0,"Simply put, the best Tapas in Barcelona. The food was amazing and the service was great. It was so good we went 2 nights in a row. Absolutely worth the wait. "
2219,9-06-2016 ,5.0,"This is the place for tapas. All of them are extremely fresh and good. The waiters are efficient, friendly and paying attention to you.If you really exaggerate with the amount of food you order, the final bill will still be similar to a medium restaurant. So, no worries, eat everything and enjoy!The restaurant doesn't take reservations and depending on your arrival time, the wait could be up to 2 hours. Avoid getting there when everyone else wants to eat and you may get a table on the spot.Close to Rambla de Catalunya and city center, this is where I bring friends, family and work dinners :)"
2220,8-06-2016 ,5.0,We heard about the place from a friend. Great food at a reasonable price. Very good service. Not near all the tourist places
2221,8-06-2016 ,4.0,We tried to eat here on our first night but as it very well with. Regards told it would bexpect an hour and half. We. Went back the following day and it was certainly worthThe half hour wait.
2222,7-06-2016 ,5.0,They serve the best food I've tried around Rambla de Catalunya! And the service staff are so accommodating and friendly. The only obstacle is waiting to be seated ... but the wait is all worth it!
2223,6-06-2016 ,5.0,"If you go here, you have to try the ""Angry Eggs"" and the Steak Tapa is very good too! I cannot wait to go back to try some of the other Tapas at dinner but the place is packed to the sidewalk! Naomi was a fantastic server even though they sat her 8 tables within a few minutes!"
2224,6-06-2016 ,4.0,"You'll have to wait around 60-90 minutes to get in.Some of the people in line wait inside the restaurant, which can add some noise.The food is tasty, especially the eggplant with goat cheese and pepper, and the classic bread with tomatoes.Try to get a table deep inside the restaurant or on the bar."
2225,6-06-2016 ,5.0,Don't waste your time waiting for a table and sit at the bar counter. It is far more fun and the waiters are super nice. Also you can check the tapas.Try their special bear. It is great 
2226,5-06-2016 ,5.0,"We arrived late at night and asked our concierge where we could get a bite to eat (at 11pm), he suggested here and what a treat on the first night. The staff spoke very good English which was good given that there are two ways to eat, inside or out and depending on which you choose you need to go add your name to a list but luckily we were seated straight away outside. In true tapas style it all arrives at different times so the best way is to share all dishes, they were all extremely tasty! There was a good atmosphere and it was very busy up to 12am, don't be put off by the crowds of people outside. It is very good value for money we had 5 dishes and a 1/2litre of sangria for €35 "
2227,5-06-2016 ,2.0,"After receiving recommendations from three different people we had high expectations. We queued for more than an hour (no bookings, just need to come and register at the reception, and have a drink elsewhere in the meantime while waiting- the receptionist told us when a table will be ready). The food was O.K- nothing fancy really, no big disappointments either- just average food. Wasn't that expensive as well, so overall it was alright, but we expected more. The hype is not justified here!"
2228,5-06-2016 ,5.0,"My wife and I were looking for some late night Tapas (after midnight) and this was one of the highlights of the trip. Waited a little while but got a seat at the bar and enjoyed some amazing tapas, some hot dishes and a few more drinks. Recommend the seafood salad, grilled cuttlefish, shrimp skewers, and many more! "
2229,5-06-2016 ,4.0,"Not sure that it was worth the 45 minute wait for a table, as there seem to be plenty of comparable places nearby, (if you want less of a wait try Vinitus Barcelona on Carrer del console de cent.) but no complaints - it was good tapas, good service and a fun atmosphere with locals mixed in with the hoards of tourists."
2230,4-06-2016 ,1.0,We came here because the reviews were very positives and we just wanted to have a last tapa meal before leaving the city. What a mistake! It's a super crowded place with an almost industrial approach to feeding poor tourists that know nothing about tapas. The food was 'meh' and one dish was so oily we just could not eat it. We said that the plate was unbeatable but the waiter did not say anything and we just found the dish in the bill... There are so many tapas place in Barcelona that one should really look for something else. 
2231,4-06-2016 ,5.0,"The food is the best we had in Barcelona, great tapas, and hot ones as well. My favourite is the shimp cocktail salad, but there are tons with anchovies and the olives are the biggest we have seen.Friendly staff, good drinks and beer. Not expensive compared to others and the food is much better. Dessert suggested: crema catalana! Kinda similar to the creme bruleé, but better!And it's conveniently located but hidden.Always croweded, so either go very early or not in a hurry, it is worth the wait."
2232,4-06-2016 ,5.0,"We think this is probably the best tapas in Barca. We've been coming here for 10 years and it amazing, busy, but amazing. Get there early as it gets packed in the evenings. "
2233,4-06-2016 ,5.0,"Food is great and fresh, ambiance is great, good value quality versus price.I would recommend to arrive around 19:30 , after it is very crowded but this is what it makes the fun.Was so nice we came twice within two days.A mustn't miss place."
2234,3-06-2016 ,4.0,"It is tapas Restaurant. You should try it. All tapas i tried were delicious that were; four cheese, fried hot green pepper, grilled mushroom and squids. The catalan cream is the perfect dessert. Don't try cream caramel. Price is 46 € approximately with half liter sangria for 2 person. "
2235,3-06-2016 ,5.0,"Have been several times to this popular spot for locals and tourists alike. Great selection of Pinxas and Tapas, reasonably priced with a great lively atmosphere. Service is great and prices reasonable. Highly reccomended."
2236,3-06-2016 ,5.0,"nice and reasonable priced spanish tapas, very long queue even at 4-5 pm, so better make reservation. crowded by both locals & tourist. not far from casa milà and casa batlló, should definitely swing by in between these 2 spots"
2237,2-06-2016 ,5.0,"Catalan would be hard to beat for experiencing a tapas dinner while in BCN - very lively, fun bartenders while you wait, menus in English, attentive servers who had good recommendations, good prices - fun, fun, fun. Arrive 8:00 to 8:30 and plan to wait a bit as that is part of the fun."
2238,2-06-2016 ,5.0,"We loved this restaurant! The variety of tapas was amazing - and everything we ordered exceeded our expectations. The restaurant itself is well attractive and well laid out. There are counter and table seating options. Although quite busy, we never felt crowded - and our waitress did an amazing job of serving a number of tables with a constant smile and excellent service.We recommended the restaurant to friends who arrived just as we were leaving Barcelona. They also loved the restaurant and returned twice for dinner.If you are looking for tapas in a lively setting, don't miss Cerveceria Catalana!"
2239,2-06-2016 ,5.0,"We came to live in Barcelona as a couple and have been to this place over 10 times in the past 2 weeks. True, you need to queue for 20 mins, but the food is so worth it. Seafood is especially delicious. Will be back many times in the near future "
2240,2-06-2016 ,4.0,"This place is usually packed and for a good reason. The tapas are reasonably priced and tasty so its ideal for lunch if you are in the area, however due to it being packed, service suffers and waiting times can be a bit extended.PS: No reservation possible, so if you go make sure you are not in a hurry since most likely you will have to wait a bit for a table."
2241,2-06-2016 ,5.0,"This is more than a pintxos place, they also have paella and all sorts of seafood. They have the most delicious pintxos, warm and cold, we have ever had. You may sit at the bar or have a table if you're lucky. This place gets packed. The service was impeccable, very friendly and enthusiastic waitstaff. This is on top of my list for Barcelona. We will keep coming back. The pintxos are also a bit cheaper than other places like bilbao beria and irati..it's 1.70 a piece but these are just far too better than what we've had so far! Love it love it love it!!!"
2242,1-06-2016 ,5.0,"Food here is so delicious, fresh, quick and so reasonable we went twice while we're in Barcelona. On the Saturday night we arrived at 8:30 and couldn't get a table until 10pm but that was fine as the food is really quick. There were still people putting their name down at 11:30pm when we finished up, it's just so popular and for good reason! "
2243,1-06-2016 ,2.0,"We went there four people because the ''high'' recommends, none of us enjoyed the food, below the average any dish we eat it was literally not good. We ate at many other tapes restaurants before and this was the worst. Don't waste your time to go there, there are many other great places in Barcelona."
2244,1-06-2016 ,5.0,Very hospitable family place. Friendly owner behind the counter and clean environment. We all enjoyed our visit. Easy to find location and had something for everyone. 
2245,31-05-2016 ,5.0,"we ended up here after casa milà and we were starving! the place was full of people and we found two little sits close to the counter in front of the fresh fish, yummy! the sangria is the best of my life!"
2246,31-05-2016 ,4.0,"I recommend getting there a bit earlier than lunch time or dinner, it is always really crowded. We had to wait for 30 mins and then we got sited with 4 other strangers at a table... But it was worth as the tapas are good. Tiny portions (by definition tapas) so of course you have to chose a few. All of them were really good, even though some of them on the menu were not in english so had to trust the waiter's advice. "
2247,31-05-2016 ,5.0,"Although very popular among tourists, this joint hosts loyal local crowds and offers fresh and tasty tapas, very much like the sister ""Condal"".You will almost always will have to wait for a table, so put your name on the list and take a short tour of the Rambla before returning. It is definitely worth the wait..."
2248,31-05-2016 ,4.0,"This place was recommended to us by a family member, read the reviews and saw all the comments about the queues and wait times, so we arrived at about 8.15pm, only to be told come back in 45 minutes (which we were expecting). Put our names down and went to do some shopping (it is located just off a great shopping street), arrived back at 9pm when we had to wait for about another 15/20 minutes - so over an hour wait in total. By that time we were ready to eat and it was delicious!!! Had the croquettes, the baby squid, the eggs Galacian style (which we chose by pointing at what the table next to us were eating, a must try, really yum!!), fillet of beef, prawns, all delicious, washed down with a bottle of local Spanish white wine. Excellent service by the waiter, I ordered the wrong type of squid and he changed it immediately and I was made to feel it was no problem whatsoever even though the mistake was mine.We were seated in the lower half of the restaurant away from the door which was preferable I think, from what I could see if you are seated up near the door or at the counter you may be joustled quite a bit by the crowds trying to get up to the hostess to put their names down.While we wait to be seated (this was at about 9pm) the hostess was telling locals the wait wa 80 minutes and telling the tourists it would be 1.5-2hrs, both my husband and i noticed this :-). Delicious tapas, just plan on a wait before getting your table and you will be happy, if you arrived starving and expecting food quickly you are going to end up hangry :-)"
2249,31-05-2016 ,3.0,"I didn't feel relaxed when I ate here due to the fact that the place was very popular and hence: queues. I just felt I was in the way all the time waiting for our table. We were perpetually moved from one spot to another by the hostess, like it made a difference. We ordered a plate of mixed salads which consisted of: 5 mayo-based lumps of gunk where they all seemed to be all made from potato. The salad came with bread also. Previous to this the waitress asked if we wanted bread. So there we were two dishes in of: a plate of bread and a plate of potato-based salads with bread on the side. Why didn't the waitress try and sell us some ham, why bread?We ordered a tapas of mushroom and asparagus which was nothing exciting.We ordered a tapas of small fried fish where we were told post-ordering that was no longer available (and given no option to order anything else).We wanted prawns on the shell and got prawns on a skewer (on more bread and mayo) despite previously having a conversation with the waitress that we wanted the prawns to peel. The cuttlefish was exquisite and tender.We came out stuffed to the rafters on bread. It could be argued that we had ordered the wrong things, but a mixed salad consisting of mostly mayo, potato and bread was certainly not balanced.The menu of tapas of the day is all in Spanish so good luck in trying to decipher it. "
2250,30-05-2016 ,5.0,Armed with trip advisor reviews we went to this restaurant near our hotel! Fantastic is an understatement. Tapas were in portions conducive to multiple tastings. Best was mild red pepper filled with creamy cheese & tender lumps of crab. Sushi bar for those who favor raw. Go a little early (8 PM) or try in the afternoon. The secret if out and lines long. Worth the wait. Sign in and take a stroll if need be!
2251,29-05-2016 ,5.0,"We have ,over the years, eaten in many places throughout Barcelona but still can`t find a place to beat this for tapas.The variety and range of dishes is fantastic and their ability to provide consistently top class dishes remarkable. No point in extolling the virtues of this establishment any further, just try it.Always tremendously busy, so be prepared !"
2252,29-05-2016 ,4.0,"Comfortable option for solo female traveller, both times. Close to Passeig de Gracia & a number of tourist attractions, so easy to find but gets VERY busy! First meal, i had the pleasure of sitting outside at one of their sidewalk patio tables, ordered a variety of tapas & some wine - great service and delicious food. The 2nd time I went, I opted to sit inside at the bar as there was a long wait for a table. great experience - the tapas ""bartender"" behind the bar was quick, courteous and spoke great English which helped me be comfortable in a crowded & busy tapas bar. Enjoyed everything I ate both times. Would love it if they offered cava by the glass as a small improvement to the menu. Would go back if I get back to Barcelona!"
2253,29-05-2016 ,5.0,"Loved this place! I got a seat at the bar and was served almost immediately. Service was great and attentive, and the grilled cuttlefish was awesome. Considering eating here again tomorrow night."
2254,27-05-2016 ,5.0,"Our hotel recommended this restaurant as it was just two blocks away. We were told to go early (7pm) as it gets very busy later in the evening. That worked for us as we had an early flight the next day. There was a line to get in, but we found a sidewalk table almost immediately. A great selection of tasty tapas resulted in an excellent meal. We tried a number that were new to us, but all were delicious. We would eat there again the next time in Barcelona."
2255,27-05-2016 ,5.0,This is soooo good! Every tapas we took was great. Don't miss on the Patatas Bravas - can't have enough of those.It is always full so be patient.The best place to sit is at the bar where you can see it all and order.I highly recommend it!
2256,27-05-2016 ,5.0,Queso gruyente is the champion! We went twice during our trip to Barcelona. Good sangria and local crafted beer! Go with patient for the long lines.
2257,26-05-2016 ,5.0,"The best Bar de Tapas of Barcelona!Very nice environment and awesome food! We've been twice to this place. Both times we've stayed at the bar, because the waiting time to seat in a table was about 45min. But for us, staying in the bar was much better, because we could all types of pintchos and tapas... Very good service and prices are ridicules compare to the amount of food and drinks that we had!"
2258,25-05-2016 ,5.0,"I second all the 5 star comments about this restaurant in Barcelona. Large food selection, very fresh products, quick service, posh environment and reasonably priced. Make sure you either book in advance or be ready to wait at least 45-50 minutes if you go there late...They are open until 1.30am and there is a reason for that - food is good and queue is huge. We went there around 10:30 and decided to wait, I am glad we did. Me and other half paid about 60 euros for 7 tapas(mainly sea food), 3 beers and a jug of Sangria...Very reasonable price for a lovely evening and will def return this place when I am in Barcelona again."
2259,25-05-2016 ,5.0,"You have to wait 1-2 hours for a table, but so does the locals and it's worth the wait, fantastic food served by super staff. A must when in town, if not once, at least twicec or more every time in town. Try new dishes, still havnt had a bad meal here. Try there special, fried spagetti potatoes with chilli oil and egg, super, enjoy your best meal in town at a great price."
2260,25-05-2016 ,5.0,This place was recommended to us by a 5 star hotel we were staying at. And a taxi driver confirmed the choice. It is his and his friends' favourite tapas place in Barcelona. We waited for 40 minutes to get the table and it was worth every second of it. Pure heaven.
2261,25-05-2016 ,5.0,"I expected hours for the wait, but quickly found a stool by the bar. The service was perfect. The place makes you feel great, the in crowd of BCN. Mostly foreigners eat here, the tapas are fantastic, and after visiting the place 3 time the wait is bearable . one to two hours. You can not visit BCN and NIT eat here. Its a must. I recommend Ciudad , their sister restaurant as even better at the Ramblas and Grand Via. Try visiting this place the second or third day you are in town. You will experience it even better and be more selctive with your tapa choices. Superb, attentive service all the way, I spent 37 Euros solo for my meal at the bar."
2262,24-05-2016 ,5.0,"My heart is sinking as I type this because it's slowly dawning unto me (it's all the denial you see) that Id have to catch a 2+ hour flight just to eat here again. If I lived in Barcelona, Id be here every weekend. Where do I start? Four cheese montadito- absolutely delicious'Pissed egg' (I don't remember what it's called in Spanish sorry! Got this description from their fb page)- interesting. Really more-ishRazor clams- mmmmmmmmmmBaby squid- was alrightAnd finally... The pièce de résistanceThe octopus- I will dream of this for many nights. Tender, melt in your mouth octopus slices on a bed of smooth silky sweet potato mash. Perfectly seasoned. The mash was like a delightful surprise (tada!) hidden in the centre that added this extra dimension of creaminess to the dish without taking the spotlight away from the star itself. It was glorious. Simple. I loved it, had double portions of it (although my waistline and pocket hated me for it). I want more of it. Sigh.Other plus points, the waiters were very efficient and did a good job at recommending dishes. Didn't try the desserts but thought they looked so yummy everytime a waiter walked past with them. Bill was around €60 (we had drinks too). Slightly pricey but quality of food was fantastic. You get what you pay for. Cons: the wait can be excruciatingly long. We arrived at around 730pm and the cue was just starting to build. It took us about 40 mins to get a seat. However, the people that were arriving as we were being seated had to wait for around 1-1.5hours. So be prepared. If you're in Barcelona, please have some octopus for me. My wishful self (and foodie spirit) would be greatly appreciative of it. "
2263,24-05-2016 ,5.0,"My wife and I have a simple rule when it comes to travels, a simple rule - I.e doesn't matter how good a restaurant is, we eat it once. And let the rest be cravings and memories that gives us an excuse to come back.Catalana was the restaurant that broke that rule for us. The dining experience was so exceptional that we couldn't resist going back the next meal! Though we had to wait 80 minutes for dinner and around 20min for lunch, the moment you embrace their food, all the lost time becomes a distant past. Food variety is not huge, but enough to keep you guessing and surprised. Produce is extremely fresh and service is top knotch  "
2264,24-05-2016 ,5.0,"We were staying in Barcelona for a few days after disembarking from the brand new Carnival Vista. We were traveling with old college friends. As this was our second visit to Barcelona, and their first, we were acting as tour guide.Our friends, however, came prepared with a list to places to visit and one particular restaurant: Cerveseria Catalana.What a find! It was walking distance from the Marriott's Renaissance Barcelona, our hotel during our stay. We walked past expensive sidewalk cafes to reach Cerveseria Catalana. We were greeted with a line of people waiting for tables. With our name added to the list, we moved to the bar to wait. There we received our first pleasant surprise: a glass of fabulous wine for 2€. That made the hour long wait tolerable. A second round didn't hurt either.Word of advise: check frequently with the hostess to make sure you are not lost in the queue.Once we were seated, more wine was served and the difficult task of selecting our tapas items began. The potato with egg dish was unbelievable and the final step in its preparation is done table side. One is large enough to share among four people assuming other dishes are on the way. You can never go wrong with the ham dishes in Barcelona and the seafood they served must have been swimming in the Med that morning.Just as with the wine, the food prices are very reasonable. We spent half as much as we had the night before at another tapas bar for more food and wine and in a more pleasant atmosphere.The bar area can be crowded and noisy, but offers a easy way to scope out the tapas selections. If you seek a calmer atmosphere, the restaurant winds around to a more open area with less congestion and noise. Outdoor seating is also available.A place we will visit again on a return trip to Barcelona."
2265,24-05-2016 ,5.0,"server was great, we ordered so many tapas that we were very full and happy! all dishes were great! clean and great service. but it gets really busy after 8 pm, so try to have a late lunch or early dinner"
2266,23-05-2016 ,5.0,"Truuuuusssst if in Barcelona this is the tapas spot you need to visit, fantastic array of tapas, great variation of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes, buzzing atmosphere and great staff, but make sure you go early as it gets very busy from 8pm onwards!"
2267,23-05-2016 ,4.0,"I have been recommended this place by a number of friends and actually last time I tried we couldn't get in as it was too busy, 2hr waiting and that was at 11pm. So this means they are obviously doing something right, the food is stunning and cannot be faulted, I actually enjoyed the Tapas at the bar whilst waiting for the table more than the main event. I have a feeling that before this hit the tourist map it was amazing and that the atmosphere was 100% Catalan, but now I feel it is a little diluted by the large number of tourists (yes like me) so I guess you don't get the full experience. It is well worth a visit but don't be disappointed if you don't get in there are loads of other great Tapas restaurants - the fun is finding them!"
2268,22-05-2016 ,5.0,Incredible tapas. Creative. Served beautifully. Fantastic menu selection. Really a fun place but be prepared for a wait (it's worth it!). We sat at the bar and wait staff were an absolute delight. Probably the best meal in 3 weeks in Spain and Portugal. A lot of fun at this place. Spoke excellent English. Don't miss this place if you are in Barcelona.
2269,22-05-2016 ,5.0,This is the only place to go when in Barcelona atmosphere fantastic food fantastic staff fantastic best time to go before 8pm as it gets very crowded and you will have to wait for up to an hour for a table but it is well worth the wait we went two out of three nights during our stay in Barcelona there can be up to for they people waiting at any one time for a table the staff are so organized and calm and run the whole operation very efficiently they even remembered our names the second night we returned which was unbelievable if in Barcelona this is a must
2270,22-05-2016 ,5.0,"Get there early though queuing is worth the wait. Always packed out we had delicious lunch tapas and dinner tapas. Staff were efficient and very helpful, and food absolutely lovely. We were able to sit at the bar for one lunch and so could see some of the wonderful tapas and try them. But as we returned for evening meal, we were delighted to be seated in the extensive seating area.Every dish was delightful."
2271,22-05-2016 ,5.0,"The service here is second to none, efficient, courteous, fast. Our server Gloria explained dishes, knew to stagger their arrival so as not to overwhelm the table, and unlike so many restaurants out there, we did not have to wait for the card machine for 15 minutes - a server brought it over immediately. All of this despite the place being absolutely heaving with customers, and a queue out the door.The food was great tasting, varied and well-priced. We had 6 tapas, 2 deserts and a coffee for a reasonable 40 euros. Recommended: cold prawns, jamon platter, octopus. Compared to the tapas restaurants we have visited, the strength of this place is consistently good food. Others may have been perhaps more surprising, but were sometimes hit and miss.Tips: get there early - we arrived 7.45pm and had to wait for a table. It was a short wait of 10 minutes but still very busy. When you arrive, go directly to the lady behind the desk to put your name on the list for a table. Hang around the bar to listen for your name. If you can find a seat at the bar, sit down and order drinks, then take them with you to the table. Don't be discouraged if you are told 30 mins wait time. It seems many people miss their booking, and our wait time was shortened to just 10 minutes. Have a good night!"
2272,22-05-2016 ,4.0,My wife and I ate here on our first night in Barcelona. This restaurant was recommended through our hotel and came recommended from friends. We had a very good dinner and the restaurant has very traditional tapas dishes. The prices were very reasonable. The only drawback would be that the restaurant does tend to have more tourists than many of the places we ate later in the week. 
2273,22-05-2016 ,4.0,"Large, and full of locals, this tapas bar in central Barcelona offers a wide assortment of well-made tapas. Good for a snack, or for dinner."
2274,22-05-2016 ,5.0,Very good food at reasonable prices in a good atmosphere. Recommend the shrimp. Will be going back very soon
2275,21-05-2016 ,5.0,"A wide assortment of tapas that should be able to satisfy anyone's appetite. All of my choices were very tasty. The same was true for everyone else in our party. The only drawback to this restaurant, besides being so popular and crowded, is that they do not take reservations. Patience is needed if you want to experience some tasty and different tapas."
2276,21-05-2016 ,5.0,The best tapas place in Barcelona . Ok confession we went them 5 times in 5 days ; that's how much we found this place good. Tasty salad and tasty tapas . The best I had I the whole of Spain . Recommend strongly ! 
2277,21-05-2016 ,3.0,"Because of the good reviews on tripadvisor we've went to this restaurant. We can describe this restaurant the best as a tapas factory. Although it tasted okay, we didn't had the impression that the tapas were made with love and care. Perhaps because of the high turnaround. If you're looking for standard tapas (like patatas bravas) you can go here. If you do, and you're going for diner, don't forget to make a reservation!"
2278,21-05-2016 ,5.0,So popular it is hard to get in. Fantastic Tapas if you can stand the wait and crowds. Not sure if they take reservations.
2279,21-05-2016 ,5.0,"Hey everyone,Another big surprise concerning this bar tapas, in Barcelona at Carrer de Mallorca (close from the station Passeig de Gracia). You won't regret your choice!With some friends, we went during the week after 8pm and the waiter told us that it may take about hour time to get a table. The place was crowed and full! Surprisingly we waited 10 minutes and we had a table inside (they have also a bar and a terrace).The prices were quite cheap, the waiters took care of us and the food was so delicious! In total with beverages and desserts, we paid 28€ each person and we had some leftovers.So place to be to eat very tasty tapas!"
2280,21-05-2016 ,5.0,"We already came in that place last october, I rembember it was good but I remember we had to wait for an hour to eat. Which I never do usually So I was not looking forward to come back here. But we gave it another shot and OMG it was much better than I remembered!!!The grilled gambas were crazy good, Iberian ham and pimientos del padron (the boss little green peppers) are my favoutite. Si be patient, you have the possibility to go shopping or have a drink near by so it's not that horrible! Just come before you are really hungry because it is always crowded!! And we understand why!! "
2281,20-05-2016 ,5.0,Love this place - will always comeBack with work friends family - whoever enjoys great food !!!Great tapas plenty of Catalan food and good atmosphere ;-)
2282,20-05-2016 ,5.0,"Great variety of tapas, sandwiches, small plates to order from. All excellent food, quick service good house wine by the glass. Waitress was helpful with ordering and menu was fairly easy to understand. Very crowded, popular place, but definitely recommend!"
2283,20-05-2016 ,4.0,"We were supposed to arrive at our hotel at about 22.15, drop our bags & get some food. No such luck! Thanks to Vueling/Iberia/Barcelona Airport we waited for over an hour & half for our luggage, some of it didn't turn up! After more mishaps we arrived & checked in, thanks to Ivan telling us about this place we got our food!Reasonable prices, great selection & helpful staff, what more could you want? At 00.30 we weren't expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised. We closed the place & the staff didn't hassle us to leave at all!! Give it a try during your trip,you won't be disappointed. "
2284,20-05-2016 ,5.0,"Food was excellent, good prices, service was excellent, sherwin the waiter, was polite. We had to wait 30 min for a outside seats , but it was well worth it. This is the place to go!!"
2285,20-05-2016 ,4.0,"We were staying in the Eixample district and had a few places we wanted to try. Every time we mentioned this place, people had great things to say, except they said it gets crowded and there is a long wait if you eat late. Being American, that is not an issue. We went around 6:30 and there was no wait. The food was excellent. They had a regular menu, available in English, and menu of the day, which was not. Our waiter translated any of the dishes when we asked, but he was in a hurry for us to order and after we finished our first round of tapas and wanted something else, he stood there rushing us to order something else. The food was excellent and we tried five different dishes, my personal favorite being the eggplant/goat cheese timbale. They had a good bottle of Spanish merlot for 15E. Total bill came to 46E and I would definitely go back. "
2286,20-05-2016 ,5.0,have always come back to this restaurant everytime I visit Barcelona as the food is so amazing and the quality and standard NEVER EVER drops!Pro tip: visit during their off peak hours to ensure quick seating. Peak hours will see a table wait of at least 1-1.5hours
2287,20-05-2016 ,5.0,"My husband and I ate here at the bar on in the late afternoon. We had tried to get in around 7:30pm a few days earlier and it was packed out the door. So we came back another day around 3:30 and found seating at the bar, which we wanted, without a long wait. (Soon after that the line got much longer). We enjoyed their Cava and Sangria while sampling quite a few tapas which were displayed right in front of us at the bar. Everything we ate was fresh and delicious! Some of the items we sampled were croissant with ham and mozzarella (served warm), montadino artichoke with jamon (ham), beef tenderloin montadino (DELICIOUS), avocado bow tie pasta, seafood crabmeat tapas. Definitely try to go here while visiting Barcelona!"
2288,20-05-2016 ,5.0,"This place is incredible! you have to wait at leat 30 minutes everyday to have a seat but it is worth of! best tapas I have ever tried, fresh fish, delicious meat, everything done at the moment and just in front of you! My best place is just at the bar, because you can choose directly what you prefer to eat and see how the waiter prepare the dish for you. Highly recommended"
2289,20-05-2016 ,4.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by the owner of our B&B in Barcelona. It is always full and you cannot make prior bookings. The best advice I can give is get there early, before 8pm. You may still have to wait half an hour or so but it is worth it. If you don't mind sitting outside you can get a table earlier, just wait until a table leaves and ask the waiter if you can sit there. We were on the waiting list and this is what we did after waiting about 20 minutes for an indoor table. The tapas is really good and very reasonably priced, hence it being so busy."
2290,20-05-2016 ,5.0,"It is very difficult to find a table at this place, we had lunch at the bar which was very nice anyway! Every tapa we had was great! The staff is very kind and helped us to find the most tradicional tapas to try. The sangria is very good. The place, people and the atmosphere are cool!"
2291,19-05-2016 ,5.0,The place was recomended and it did live up to the high expectations. You do have to wait in line for like an hour if it its around dinner time. The food is great the portions are small but thats it. The service is great as well.
2292,19-05-2016 ,1.0,"Where are all of the good/excellent reviews coming from? This is the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant! Everything seemed to be too much trouble; I couldn't read any of the spanish tapas of the day menu so needed some help but didn't get any, I was then shown the tapas in the bar area to make it easier - it didn't as wasn't being told what things were called in Spanish on the menu & I could see in the face of the waitress that I was too much hard work. When the tapas arrived only 2 dishes came so I waited for the third... And waited... And waited until I asked where's the third dish, the response I was supposed to eat the 2 dishes first then have the third instead of enjoying the combination of flavours. 20 plus minutes the third dish arrived & by that time I just wanted to leave; as soon as I took the last bite of food I asked for the bill & then they couldn't even wait 30 seconds for me to find the change!I asked other diners for their experience & it wasn't just me disappointed in choice of restaurant.Why is this restaurant open when service is the last thing being taken care of?Don't waste your time or more importantly your money in this so-called restaurant, they need to learn that rudeness & putting customers under pressure to order/hurry up isn't inviting the culinary experience!"
2293,19-05-2016 ,4.0,La cerveseria serves great food and an impressive variety of delicious tapas. It is a well frequented spot and hence I had the feeling the staff was a bit in a rush! Go in early because later you'll have to wait long for seats!
2294,19-05-2016 ,5.0,Best tapas restaurant we hit while in Barcelona. A very busy and well-known place that is a tourist spot but not a tourist trap. 
2295,18-05-2016 ,5.0,"Our first day in Barcelona, after long plane rides and an encounter with a local pickpocket, we asked our hotel for somewhere we could get tapas fairly early because we were going to make it a very early night. They sent us to Cerveceria Catalana. I was so rummy that I didn't realize until later that it was the same place I had written in my journal to try based on other reviews. It was exactly what we wanted. The tapas were fresh and the real deal. Jamon and shrimp and patata bravas. We got in pretty easily because it was so early - perfect for getting over jet lag."
2296,18-05-2016 ,5.0,"I have visisted cerveceria every time that i return to Barcelona. The first few times i have gone in the evenings of a weekend and have had to wait for a while to be seated, however, do not let this put you off. The food is excellent and i can not fault it. The staff are lovely and i would definitely recommend eating here when in Barcelona"
2297,18-05-2016 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a bustling place, with great variety of tapas, good selection of beverages and wonderful atmosphere. It can be chaotic and noisy and sometimes you have to wait quite a while before getting a table, but this is all part of the experience! The ingredients are always fresh! Highly recommended!"
2298,18-05-2016 ,5.0,"Incredible variety of authentic tapas and Spanish beverages, seems popular with locals which always indicates quality Spanish food. Very busy, however we were fortunate enough to be seated in the sun. Despite only having a few waiters, service was rapid and food was with us within 15 minutes of ordering. Highly recommended restaurant, very reasonably priced and excellent food/drink."
2299,18-05-2016 ,4.0,"Its a good place for tapas. They have good variety and very tasty. Service is fast and most of the time very friendly. Can not reserve, there's always a waiting list but it moves fast and you can have a glass of wine or beer while waiting. "
2300,18-05-2016 ,5.0,"Loved this restaurant. Tapas were wonderful. Service was fast and nice. It was busy, so getting their just prior to typical Barcelona dinner rush is wise. We got seated immediately, dined for about 1hr and all was great! Prices were right and the vibe was fun in that it is located right near the university. As we left, the line was out the door for seating which tells me this place is a favorite of many! I would dine hear again!"
2301,17-05-2016 ,3.0,This was our second time to the Cerveceria .If you don’t want to wait in long lines go in week days. The service isn’t the best. The taps are good.
2302,16-05-2016 ,5.0,That was one of our favorite restaurant in Barcelona. The food was amazing! Fresh and tasty. The service was so so but it worths to visit it!!
2303,15-05-2016 ,5.0,"We chose this restaurant based on some reviews we read on Trip Advisor and other friends. We went earlier on a Friday night and it was hopping with locals and tourists even before 8:30. We waited less time than we thought we'd need to and got a nice table inside. All the tapas were well worth it and we enjoyed the experience as well as the food. Very fresh, staff is helpful in recommending the specials and very accommodating to travelers who limp along in quasi Spanish!"
2304,14-05-2016 ,5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect. We booked in advance and when we turned up the queue outside reminded me of a London bus stop. Swiftly arriving at our seats we ordered what seemed to be the whole menu. Needless to say, the food was exceptional, maybe a bit on the pricey side, but the place's definitely a winner."
2305,14-05-2016 ,5.0,"We were in a cab and were heading to Las Rambles for a bite, the driver recommended this restaurant. Line out the door so we put our name on list (hour wait) the hostess recommended going shopping and coming back in about half hour. We got lucky and two seats opened up at the bar. We had a pitcher of sangria that was delicious and some very tasty tapas. Our favorites were Four Cheese on a baguette, tenderloin with a small pepper on a baguette (so tender and delicious) and some fried artichokes. Everything was so good and the waiter at bar was very nice. We chatted about the presidential election in the States.Great experience/delicious food"
2306,14-05-2016 ,5.0,"Cervecería Catalana belongs to the same family as the also famous Ciudad Condal. It is a landmark when it comes to tapas in Barcelona and boasts a privileged location. Though prices are not low, it is always crowded, which says much in favor of the quality of the offer."
2307,13-05-2016 ,5.0,"A great way to get the Spanish-tapas experience. Go to the bar, get the servers to pay attention to you, order drinks and finger/tapas food right there, and interact with other clients, while you wait for your table. Everything we order was awesome."
2308,13-05-2016 ,5.0,"Visited this place on recommendation of our air bnb host and it did not disappoint. There was a queue out the door so we added our name to the list and came back about 11pm for some tasty tapas. I think we ordered almost everything from the menu but we hardly broke the bank, really affordable and the best tapas I've ever had!"
2309,12-05-2016 ,5.0,"Great food, you may have to wait for a table, but worth waiting as the food is excellent. A great combination of tapas, warm and friendly service, also outstanding value for money. Have recommended to others and would return to, if staying in the area."
2310,11-05-2016 ,5.0,"High quality ingredients for tasty, well cooked, elaborate Catalan and Spanish classics. In a sophisticated part of town, at a price that is above average but proportional to the quality of the cooking.Do not expect much from the staff. The service is in general not very attentive and quite expeditive.The place is always crowded and noisy but pleasant in a casual way.Beware! There are impossible queues always! You must get there as soon as they open-no reservations.All things considered, a delicious and entertaining meal."
2311,11-05-2016 ,3.0,"It is always too crowded, I am used to visit the restaurant once or twice a year, the food quality is good but too crowded, it is more for foreigner as tourist attraction than tapas bar to get the beer and some tapas with friends but the quality and variety is very good"
2312,10-05-2016 ,4.0,"Sunday lunch having just arrived in Barcelona: excellent. Bustling with a queue to get in, worth the short wait. This place is popular with locals and tourists alike. Good solid local cuisine well prepared and efficiently served in a lively restaurant. Recommended. "
2313,10-05-2016 ,3.0,"Best ""montaditos"" in town, without doubt. But if you have to wait hours for a table, and even are not able to gather a tiny space at the bar due to all the people hanging around, eating and drinking - better go to another place!"
2314,10-05-2016 ,4.0,"If you do not know spanish, you can speak to the server for recommendations and they will be pleased to assist. Enjoyed the dishes and we were there on a tuesday afternoon before 12pm so the restaurant was just filling up. Try to go early if not expect an hr or more waiting time for seats. "
2315,9-05-2016 ,5.0,Great tapas and really good for breakfast! Highly recommended to anyone wanting traditional local produce...amazing!
2316,9-05-2016 ,5.0,"The food was really good, really tasty. The prices were up to what we ate even cheaper. But the time to get a table is way too long "
2317,9-05-2016 ,5.0,"We succeeded in getting a table on our third try but it was soooo worth it. Came here on recommendation of our hotel concierge who said it was his favorite tapas bar. We ate on a Monday night at 7pm. There was a line by the time we left. No bookings available but absolutely superb food - worth a wait. Choose from the assorted montaditos which are on display at the bar, they look like daily specials. We had crab piled high on bread for 1.70. Menu items were dearer. Once seated go and choose from the display cabinet and they will bring to your table. Cheap food and wine. Don't miss it!"
2318,9-05-2016 ,5.0,"Cervercería Catalana has an optimal location, just 2 blocks away from Diagonal metro station and 4 blocks from Paseo de Gracia Metro Station. It is reachable by any means or in any direction. Its tapas are fresh, excellent quality, consistent service and product. The service is fast and flexible, although it is a fast paced place due to the amount of customers, you can have a nice and tranquil experience at the table. It is very crowded all the time with a balance between tourists and locals so if you don´t mind eating outside of standard hours go there outside peak hours ( 13.30-15.30) (20.00-22.30). As for the food anything you try is good, specially all sea food and montaditos (the tapa content on a slice of bread)."
2319,8-05-2016 ,5.0,"We ate her at the recommendation of the staff at the hotel we were staying. We informed it was the ""best tapas in Barcelona"" and least to say it tasted superb. The tapas was reasonably priced as was the drinks, we shared a jug of sangria. The atmosphere was lively and people were still queuing for a tables after midnight. "
2320,8-05-2016 ,5.0,"As many of Barcelona's restaurants they don't make reservations you have to go and wait for a table. But, it is worth it. The tapas are delicious and reasonably priced. If you want to eat tapas I recommend to go to this restaurant. "
2321,8-05-2016 ,5.0,Definitely a bad plan to go there the week-end of Mother's Day! It is the place to melt your credit card but it is beautiful and if you like shopping enjoy!
2322,8-05-2016 ,5.0,Busy place so we had to wait a bit which was fine. The staff were friendly and looked as if they had being doing this all of their life and enjoying it. Food was great. We got a selection of tapas and bread. Experience tapas at their best. 
2323,7-05-2016 ,4.0,"I stopped here after going to a FC Barcelona game- not near there, place was near my hotel. And open until 1:30AM.had a plate of small fried fish that was great...Chimay beer for less than 4 euros."
2324,7-05-2016 ,4.0,Excelent typical food in very modern Way to Service and Good beer nice Restaurant and very well Service the waitress are excelent
2325,6-05-2016 ,1.0,Food is ok. But gusy that work there are unprofessional and extremely unkind! From the first moment they show us the attitude like we are not wellcome.
2326,6-05-2016 ,4.0,"We loved three tapas..tender beef, artichoke and the small fried fish small plates.We shared a 1/2 bottle of wine for about 7 euros"
2327,6-05-2016 ,4.0,"We 've been there several times already and the tapas are still great. The have a menu that was in English which is better but the the menu of the day should be translated too.Service at the table is nice and efficicent but the one at the reception is a deception: there were a lot of people and to be put on the list, the receptionist ask us our name. The way she did it was very impolite. At each group coming she would say dryly : ""Name?!"" Like us a few persons were surprised by the tone but we didn't say anything in order to keep out place in line.This is why I give only 4 points. Next time, if the reception is the same, I'll go down to 3."
2328,6-05-2016 ,5.0,Great atmosphere and quick professional service once things started. Grab a glass or two at the bar and enjoy a bit of people watching. If you want to feel like a European don't miss this place as it is a real melting pot of different Nationalities.Staff are fast and professional and the food first class of its type.
2329,4-05-2016 ,5.0,"Service was quick and prompt. Make a reservation or be prepared to queue though. My friend and I went at about 730 pm thinking we'd have an early dinner - but we waited for about 45 minutes before we got a table. Perfecto tiempo para espana cena nonetheless! The grilled cuttlefish and bread with tomato remains the star of the tapas dinner despite and because of its simplicity and freshness. The place was bustling with people, was a wonderful dinner. We ordered the garlic prawns, grilled cuttlefish, bread with tomato, patata bravas, asparagus & mushroom and half a litre of sangria for two. We were filled and it cost us barely 45€ for this awesomeness, worth every bit of it!"
2330,4-05-2016 ,3.0,"This place usually draws a long queue of tourists. It's not particulary special but it's okay priced and quick. The ""camenbert crujiente"" is one of the better tapas if you go, order this one. But dont wait in line for this place. If you go, go early and have a quick dinner and then go for drinks somewhere else. "
2331,4-05-2016 ,5.0,Amazing food and Sangria! The place is super crowded in peak times so sometimes one has to wait for one or two hours to get a seat but it is definitely worth it!
2332,3-05-2016 ,2.0,"We were recommended this restaurant by the hotel as having fantastic food for a reasonable price. It was a reasonable price, service was ok, but the food was really disappointing. If you're looking for really great tapas go down the road and visit Vinitus"
2333,3-05-2016 ,5.0,"Enjoyable experience, well designed restaurant and a gastronomic fashionable and perfect when in celebration mood."
2334,3-05-2016 ,3.0,"Good tapas for a lunch experience but not fine dining. Enjoyed the assortment plate of several tapas. Most locals eat lunch around 2 pm, so lunch 12-1 is usually without waiting and not busy or hectic. "
2335,3-05-2016 ,5.0,"I took my mum and my aunties to this restaurant. Highly recommend to me by a lot of different people.You are not able to book a table so when we arrived we had an hour wait for our table.The restaurant was heaving! But that's always a good sign.We waited at the bar and after 45min secured a table outside.The food is great, typical tapas with a variety on the menu.Great value as we ordered lots of dishes and polished off three bottles of wine.Reasonably priced and came to €35 euros each.This included pudding, get the home made Spanish cake! Mmmmm.Restaurant is clean and good decor, service was brilliant and the waiter was really friendly.Would defo go back when in town! "
2336,3-05-2016 ,4.0,"It is so busy here you either have to stand at the bar and eat your tapas with a drink, like the locals, or wait until a table comes free. We stood and had a nice cold Cava with some olives while we waited. Once we had a table we got stuck in to what is said to be one of the best tapas places in Barcelona, and it is definitely up there a mongst the top places.We had the razor clams, grilled in a little oil with parsley and lemon, and they were exquisite; the black paella is a speciality and the full taste of the squid comes through the ink; the montaditos are good, as is the tomato bread - a Catalan dish that is serves with almost every dish the locals have - and we also had whitebait, anchovies, cuttlefish and fried green peppers. It was all good. If we had been in the city longer we would've definitely have gone back"
2337,3-05-2016 ,5.0,"This is my second visit to this restaurant and not disappointed. Feels like a real taste of spanish food and very good. Bar and atmosphere amazing. Had to wait a while, but had a drink at pinchos at the bar, so all part of the experience. Would definitely go again and recommend."
2338,1-05-2016 ,5.0,This cerveceria recommended by many friends and websites is up to the recommendations. We tried all the tapas which were mouthwatering and we ordered their Russian salad which was super. Save some place for the desert especially their coconut pudding. 
2339,1-05-2016 ,1.0,"A friend recommended this restaurant as being the best tapas place in Barcelona. Upon entering you have to sign up on the list and then you would be waiting one hour to get a table. The selection of tapas is very big but not much more than other tapas places. Tapas were good but I had better elsewhere as well. We had ordered several seafood dishes such as mussels, squid and prawns. This place is so busy they seem to rush the food preparation. Seafood dishes were rather undercooked. Fact is that both of our wives experienced afterwards serious food poisoning."
2340,1-05-2016 ,2.0,"We were advised to eat here by our Hotel. Sitting outside to eat for lunch seemed a good idea as they have a few pavement tables....all busy. So we asked , ""How long?"" and were told 40 mins.... we left our name and went for a walk. Returned to another 15 minute wait on the pavement, and were finally seated, having to head off several people who tried to skip the queue and nab 'our' table.Thereafter we were stared at by other people hanging around waiting for a table. Hadn't thought of that! The restaurant could prevent that by having a queue to one side of the restaurant.Ordered tapas....patatas bravas (chips topped with salad cream) good. Canneloni VERY poor. We had to ask what was inside...'chicken and pork'...shedded....texture of meat paste. Greek salad, DISGUSTING. Chopped tomatoes (not fresh) and tiny cubes of some cheese (not feta), no olives and no lettuce, no onions with 2 small pieces of bread (good). Calamari was 'fine'. The waiter of course had vanished immediately he dumped the tapas on the table so we ate what we could...scraped the contents of the canneloni to the side etc.We also had a (tiny) portion of '4 cheeses', which was 2 x a very thin slice of bread wrapped in the thinnest slice of cheese, with a diamond of the other 3 cheeses on top....the size of a postage stamp.....very tasty ....but basically two mouthfuls.Sorry we never thought to take pics.We thought the restaurant was too busy/understaffed? Service was poor. Food quality and value for money, so disappointing. Worst meal we had in Barcelona."
2341,30-04-2016 ,4.0,Visited here during a 4 day trip to Barcelona. Stopped for a late lunch on a Thursday and it wasn't too busy. Took the advice of others and requested a seat by the bar. You get to see the different type of tapas and can just point to what you want. Staff as others have said are a bit sour faced so don't expect smiles and laughs. The place has a kind of Benihana's feel to it and I must have seen at least 3 Japanese Chiefs in the kitchen. Food is lovely and well prepared but it is Touristy. Also if you do decide to sit at the bar it can get cramped really quick especially when ordering tapas as the plates pile up and can make it a bit uncomfortable with the person next to you. 
2342,30-04-2016 ,5.0,"Been there in my second time in Barcelona. Went there around 19.30. Got into the waiting list and we were served in a table after 45 minutes. The rich variety of the food gives you a nice dinner. Go there with empty stomach as you will want to order and taste most of them. All look and taste delicious. We ordered skewed prawns, grilled cuttlefish (this was the best to me), classic bread with tomato sauce and patatas bravas with ali-oli sauce. The service was quick and staff was friendly. I recommend the place and probably will go again "
2343,30-04-2016 ,4.0,Recently visited this restaurant twice while in Barcelona. First for dinner and then found it to be so good we ended up going back for lunch. The tenderloin sandwich Tapas and the mini burgers were huge hits with great flavor. Very crowded and no resos so plan ahead.
2344,29-04-2016 ,4.0,"Went here after getting some warm recommendations. I found a place to sit at the bar, as the place was packed and there was a line standing outside the place! So clearly, it was super popular.Went for 2 Tapas who were excellent, 2 kinds of alcohol (a beer and a digestif), desert and coffee for around 16 euro, which isn't all that expensive (at least for me).So I highly recommend this place, just make sure to order a place in advance as it is super popular!"
2345,28-04-2016 ,5.0,"I have been here several times. There is usually a long line, but the food is worth waiting for. Excellent!"
2346,27-04-2016 ,4.0,"I've visited this restaurant on my every visit to barcelona for a reason, the food is amazing! The price is also reasonable considering how good it is. The place is super busy and without a reservation during 9pm we had to wait over an hour to get a table. The atmosphere in the restaurant is really nice, but the waiters kept changing and I must say almost no one even smiled, even the woman at the door - most of the waiters looked just annoyed that they had yet another table. Even though the service wasn't good, the delicious food will keep me going back! "
2347,26-04-2016 ,4.0,"We visited this tapas restaurant on a busy weekend over Spanish lunch time. Since it was very busy and noisy inside, we chose to sit outside, but the counter seats inside are a cultural treat if they are not too busy!.Our waiter was informative, friendly and fast. Two of us shared 7 tapas dishes ( beef fillet, prawns, sardines, mushrooms, spicy potatoes, calamari,and a coconut dessert), and we were very full. All dishes were well seasoned and delicious (the fillet of beef served on a bun, and the prawns were outstanding. ). But experiment and try something out of your usual comfort zone ... each dish is small and reasonably priced, so a great chance to try something new."
2348,26-04-2016 ,5.0,"This is a fabulous restaurant in Barcelona that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. we went twice during our week stay in Barcelona because the food was so good. The service was friendly. The line outside proves just how delicious it is and it moves quickly so don't be discourage when you see many people waiting for a table."
2349,26-04-2016 ,3.0,"If you have never had tapas, this is a decent starting place. But, we have had better both In Barcelona and in Malaga. The ambience is rather nonexistent; the staff seemed exasperated by foreigners (not a good thing in a town full of them) and the calamari was a bit more than rubbery! We have enjoyed more and better before and since. BUT: they are OPEN ON SUNDAY! And that makes a big difference! Most other places are not open on Sunday...and that may explain the ""meh"" attitude and food....perhaps a bit frazzled at the hour we were there??"
2350,26-04-2016 ,5.0,"We know a lot of tapas bar in Barcelona, but this one is certainly one of the best place to be. Are you in the queue well be patient ! Your pleasure will be your recompense."
2351,26-04-2016 ,5.0,"The restaurant is bustling but it is all in good fun! The food was amazing, the waitstaff charming (and proficient in English), and the ambience attractive and lively, with the perfect mix of locals and tourists!!! I highly recommend!"
2352,25-04-2016 ,4.0,"Very fresh, busy and great selection....only issue...always crowded. Large sit down area but it pays to wait for a seat at the counter. There the selection is rotated and you see exactly what you want and order. Very reasonable for the neighborhood."
2353,25-04-2016 ,5.0,"I definitely recommend you to go! Tapas are more than delicious! I recommend you pimientos del padron, huevos cabreaos ( expect a big portion for this one) anchovies with vinegar, the olives are amazing too. Do not order langustinos, they are just boiled shrimps, choose the ones with garlic."
2354,25-04-2016 ,5.0,"After meeting a friend who lives in Barcelona he suggested taking us for Tapas. What a suprise,The food is amazing and the service friendly. if possible try and sit at the bar as it is a very busy resturant and it is so much easier to point at what you would like to eat. If you like sangria try a jug you will not be dissapointed. Also dont be put off by the queue as it moves fairly fast and the wait is worth it."
2355,25-04-2016 ,5.0,"This was our 4th visit to this amazing city. Each time we come, we eat here at least twice. The food is great, prices are reasonable and service friendly. It's frequented mostly by locals. Be prepared to wait but we'll worth it!"
2356,25-04-2016 ,5.0,"This is the place to be if you want to enjoy great Catalan Tapas. The Restaurant does not take reservations which gives you two options, either you are queuing for a table to sit down or you stand at the bar which is my preferred choice as this gives you the typical Spanish feeling. Try the Patatas Bravas, the Jamon Iberico, the Potato Tortilla and the Solomillo!"
2357,25-04-2016 ,5.0,"Tapasbar, casual atmosphere, busy - you better book a table in advance. I was here first time 12 years ago and despite its popularity it still keep the quality on food and wine high and value for the money."
2358,24-04-2016 ,1.0,"The atmosphere is excellent and some of the tapas are good, however, shellfish are gritty and I'm not interested in eating crunchy shellfish. The wine is excellent and s few of the dishes are excellent, but watch out for the shellfish!"
2359,24-04-2016 ,5.0,"We were told about this place by a local who gave us the tip. From our first time there, we loved it. Such an array of tapas/food to choose from - all fresh and nicely prepared. It can be tough to get a seat at the bar or you can reserve a table at the restaurant. The bar though is the place to be! There seem to be more tourists going each year as word gets out about its quality. Better of course then to go during the week and/or miss the peak times for lunch, which you can do if on holiday. A definite recommend."
2360,23-04-2016 ,5.0,"Recommended to us both by locals and by travelers. We got there after 9:30pm and still has to wait for a while, but totally worth it. Good food and nice ambiance."
2361,23-04-2016 ,4.0,"Enjoyed eating at this restaurant. With such high reviews I had to check it out. If you come during peak times 8-10pm expect to wait, but luckily we found a spot at the bar. The waiters at the bar were very quick and helpful in ordering. We had the razor clams, the croquets, beef tenderloin Montadito, huevos cabreaos, the mini burgers, the almond crusted cheese, and the tomato bread. The best items and must haves are the huevos cabreaos and the beef tenderloin Montadito. The huevos cabreaos is fries mixed with spicy sauce and an egg. The waiter miss it up in front of you and it's fantastic. Worth coming back for just that.The beef tenderloin Montadito was a small 2-4 oz steak on top of toast and the steak was cooked perfectly. Price was very reasonable with most items. Waiters at the bar took very good care of us."
2362,23-04-2016 ,4.0,"I liked this restaurant and all its tapas. Typically for Spain, you have the possibility to try different tastes and share them with the group. We had different tapas accompanied by sangria, which was really nice. I really liked the green peppers and shrimps. The fries with eggs, a traditional dish was really nice cooked here. The atmosphere is amazing, it is full of people and quite noisy that gives you a certain coziness. They don’t take reservations so you should come early in order to catch a table without having to wait. The service was not the best but the food compensated."
2363,22-04-2016 ,5.0,It was our last meal in Barcelona and we had such a great time! We love all the dishes that were recommended by the waiter (we had a table outside) and the fact that he didn't just recommend the more expensive dish just made it better.
2364,21-04-2016 ,4.0,"This restaurant is popular so waiting for a table is probably expected. We arrived at 4pm on a Sunday and had to wait 15 minutes. The place was buzzing, servers were brisk and businesslike, crowd was a mix of tourists and locals.Food was above expectations. Had the croissant with ham and cheese which came toasted that was really tasty. The pulpo a la gallega and fried anchovies were also excellent. Good value overall."
2365,21-04-2016 ,5.0,"We just returned from a week in Barcelona and we are here 4 times, good is incredible and the price is so low I think they undersell themselves. Can be a 30-45 min wait when they are busy but it is most definitely worth the wait, we will return!"
2366,21-04-2016 ,5.0,"My favourite tapas bar in Barcelona! You get tasty tapas, pay low price. My advice: come a bit earlier then the rest (like between 17 and 20 pm) and it will not be necessary to wait for a table). After 21 pm it is always really full here."
2367,20-04-2016 ,5.0,"This is the best tapas shop in the city! Everything was great and fresh!It will be worth sitting by the bar if you don't understand spanish. Body language and pin pointing with ur fingers are the best language.There was a long queue during weekend and they don't accept reserve for the next day or hours later. therefore, be there earlier to book for your table. it's in the city therefore u can walk around. trust me, it's worth the wait! or, you can go during weekdays. although the queue will still be there but it's comparatively shorter (90 minutes vs 20 minutes).Must eat: Grill beef and fish cod!!My bf and I ordered 6 tapas and a bottle of water, and it costs only 30+ euro!!It's much worth going than 7 Portes."
2368,20-04-2016 ,5.0,"I had read somewhere that Cervecería Catalana offered what might be the best tapas in Barcelona. We ate there on our first night. I can confirm, it rocks.We had a pitcher of sangria de cava. I think our server mis-charged us because it was only 11.60 € for a pretty big pitcher. It took us a while to get through it, but it was tasty, especially if you like bubbles in your beverages.My girlfriend absolutely died over the huevos cabreaos (6.15 €) - an egg on top of a bunch of french fries with spicy sauce. The server mixes the egg into the whole thing, making a creamy mess. My girlfriend spent the rest of the trip hoping to replicate that, but we never found a place that offered the sauce in tandem with the egg and fries.Because I'm not much of an egg lover, I ordered my own patatas bravas - spicy potatoes. They were great. A half order was just 2.40 €.The best thing I ate was the mini hamburger (3.10 € each). You wouldn't think a mini hamburger would be worth eating at a tapas joint. YOU'D BE WRONG. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned beef. I'm salivating just writing about it.I enjoyed my montadita jamon iberico (2 €), a small chunk of bread with the famous jamon on top.I tried the pan y tomate (2.45 €), but I don't understand the allure of bread that had some tomato rubbed on it. I guess this is a traditional starter, since it was offered at a ton of places and some servers looked at me like I was nuts when I passed.For the wow factor, you can get the camembert cheese crusted in almonds with some kind of fruit sauce on it. It's on a stick because why not? For 2.95 €, it's a cheap thrill, even if it's insanely rich.We ate like kings and walked out of this place for 42.95 €. That's actually one of the cheapest dinners we had in Spain, and certainly among the best. I would love to return."
2369,20-04-2016 ,5.0,"We went here for lunch hoping it wont be much crowded but I guess we waited for almost an hour but I don't regret any bit of it. The place has a good vibe and very friendly staff. Try the ""Cabreaos"" Eggs Style (potato and egg) and it is amazing!! One of the best foods I'v had in Barcelona!"
2370,20-04-2016 ,4.0,"Based on reviews I read I decided to visit it and waited like 30 minutes for a seat. I ordered from the tapas of the day menu and wasn't impressed. Nothing bad, just not impressive. To be fair though, I saw some plates passing by that looked good and service was great so I might not have made the right choice or is it that I relied too much on tripadvisor tips :)"
2371,19-04-2016 ,4.0,"I had heard good things about this place and tried it out. The food was very good, service attentive, and I had fun conversations while sitting at the tapas bar. Downsides are that it is crowded and loud."
2372,18-04-2016 ,5.0,"Ordered one beer and 5 tapas set for my self. The lady who took care of my table was so nice. Apparently, next couple talked to me and had a warm/fun conversation with them and the lady! Had a best time. Waited for over 30mins but it's worth it! Hope to come back if i ll visit Barcelona again ;)"
2373,18-04-2016 ,5.0,"This is the bigger version of Ciutat Comtal/Condal...it would appeal more to larger groups but has the same great tasting tapas. The huge plate of very thinly-sliced chorizo Iberico was oh-so good. And there's the white anchovies in vinegar, the patatas bravas, tomato bread, gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic), Huevos cabreaos (crispy thin potato sticks mixed with fried eggs). The Sangria here is not too sweet, so it is perfect. We ate here twice and had to line up both times, but it was worth the wait."
2374,18-04-2016 ,1.0,"My friend and I ate here based on the numerous reviews we found on Trip Advisor. All I can say is: OVERRATED! They rush you, barely take the time to explain the tapas of the day menu (which is only in Spanish), the food is ok, and it's over priced for the quality of food you eat. I don't understand what people like about it. My guess it's mainly tourists. Try ""Tosca"", which is near the Palau de la Musica Catalana, it's MUCH better!"
2375,18-04-2016 ,5.0,This restaurant was recommended by a local and lived up to the expectation! Food was soooo good! The best fried artichoke we had in Barcelona- light and crispy! Grilled squid was fresh and perfectly done! The staff was very friendly!
2376,18-04-2016 ,3.0,"There were 10 of us (the other 8 had waited for well over an hour for a table - they don't take bookings) and we arrived just s the courses came out.Frankly, I don't understand why everyone raves about boiled potatoes and spicy sausage on bread. To call it ""average"" is really exaggerating.Personally, I think any visitor to Barcelona can find much, much better places."
2377,18-04-2016 ,5.0,"Fantastic frech and lovely tapas.Many, many to select from.Vegetables fish meat seafood..... For breakfast lunch an dinner:)"
2378,18-04-2016 ,5.0,"We ate here on four occasions in March, 2016, and loved he food, the atmosphere, and the company of tlocals and other visitors to Barcelona. Our choices were always made from the daily fresh menu, and raw fish dishes (crudos, ceviches, and tartars) were especially good. Raw cod with tomato and pan de cristal was a favorite, as were steamed artichokes and fried artichokes. A montadito of beef steak and fois gras was perfect, as were calcots. grilled fresh spring onions served with romesco. Don't forget to order desserts from the chalkboard on the wall just beyond the bar. We found the waiters behind both bars to be both funny and helpful, and Pancho on the door was dear. Had it not been for a recommendation from the concierge at our hotel, we probably wouldn't have come here, but we're so glad we did. We also ate at two Michelin-starred restaurants in Barcelona. They were quite good, but this will be our ""local."""
2379,17-04-2016 ,5.0,"Very crowdy with waiting time of more than one our ,but still a perfect place gor a tapas dinner. The food is delicious and inventive and the sangria is of high quality. Not to be missed!!"
2380,17-04-2016 ,5.0,"We went here on the recommendation of our hotel and WHAT a treat! It was a birthday meal and although we did not book, they accommodated the celebrations and we waited at the bar for the table and had, well.... the most incredible tapas ever eaten...We were escorted to our table and experienced a wonderful gastronomic delight! Food was ordered and served with a smile and the food makes London a poor second class cuisine cousin - I'm sorry.Incredible ambience, service and the food was heavenly. It's busy, bustling but feels very intimate at the same time. We had a mixture of Spanish omelette, fried chillies, anchovies, tomato bread, squid, olives, asparagus & mushrooms, croquettes, etc.Wine was very reasonable, both red & white. Thank you very much.The most incredible evening had by the birthday boy and friends.As a famous actor said ""I'll be back"" but to add another line...so will my friends. "
2381,15-04-2016 ,5.0,If you find a place near the bar (If you can wait 15-20 Minutes more than this it starts to be not a good choice ) you are lucky as you can have delicous many Tapas. Sangria is ok but we have better ones in Barcelona. Many seafood choices cooked or fried or raw after you choice from the bar. Delicous crowded average service but delicous.
2382,14-04-2016 ,5.0,We went in here for a quick bite and particularly enjoyed the patatas bravas and camembert cheese covered in nuts & jam - amazing!!!
2383,13-04-2016 ,5.0,"Cosy, friendly and a clean restaurant with great tapas food. We loved everything we ordered and the waiter was fantastic in making tasty suggestions. The restaurant was busy with locals and some tourists."
2384,13-04-2016 ,4.0,"Excellent spot for tapas, although I think we missed a trick on the specials by just ordering from the main menu. It was busy when we arrived but we were given a large table, which we were told would be ours for 2 hours. The tapas, sangria and cava that we ordered was amazing, and the entire restaurant had a busy and fun atmosphere (filled with lots of locals and tourists alike). The waiter seemed a bit frazzled and could be described as almost impatient with us, however, he redeemed himself by recommending an excellent bottle of cava and joking with us when we left. Would highly recommend!!"
2385,12-04-2016 ,3.0,"This was my 3rd restaurant for ~8pm dinner in the area. It would be good if we hadn't been to this ""other"" place. There were dishes that looked identical but the flavour was not as good. Locals also have very strong and mixed reviews. Basically, it's great if it's your first restaurant in Barcelona. It is busy and you will need to put your name on the waiting list. Ambience and service is great considering how busy it is. Price is reasonable. And I agree with other reviews, it might be an hour wait but food comes out fast!If you're picky and wanting the best, this isn't the place to go to. "
2386,12-04-2016 ,4.0,Always crowded but worth the wait! Really nice to have a drink and enjoy a young atmosphere! Truly spanish tapas!! A place to see and be seen! 
2387,12-04-2016 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us when looking for good place to eat tapas and we were really happy about it! We came during a peak so we had to reserve table and wait 40 minutes (so we got glass of wine in neighboring bar meanwhile) but it was really worth the waiting. People taking care of table reservations and the first waitress who took us an order for drink seemed to us bit reserved, but then another one came to take an order for eating and it was much better. We asked him for some tips what tapas to choose and he very gladly helped us with everything. We ordered artichokes, asparagus with mashrooms, squids, schrimps, clams and tomato bread. Everything was very delicious but the clams were top for us! Would visit this place again."
2388,11-04-2016 ,5.0,The title says it all. Cerveceria Catalana was the best food and sangria that I had in all of Spain!
2389,11-04-2016 ,2.0,"As a local I would highly recommend to any tourist any other place rather than this in terms of food and price-quality ratio. I have been here some time ago and I unfortunately realize that the quality has decreased. The staff is informal and the food quality is average, some dishes are served lukewarm and the prices are high. Too much hype shouldn't come at the cost of experience and quality."
2390,11-04-2016 ,4.0,"Went here with a colleague. Great tasting tapas and very good wines at reasonable prices. A marques de murrieta 2010 at EUR 24 is good value. It is a big restaurant and maybe not that cozy per se, but value for money is great and very efficient. Highly recommended. "
2391,10-04-2016 ,4.0,We could not get in the first night so decided to go early - 7pm the next night and we were really pleased. The service was efficient and the food really good.
2392,10-04-2016 ,4.0,"We ate here twice on recommendation from our hotel. Once for evening dinner tapas and once for lunch. The evening experience was at the bar where places are at a premium. The tapas selection was varied and freshly prepared. We ate several selections including proper patas bravas, prawns skewers,cuttle fish and hot veal sirloin whith a catalan creme pudding washed down with a couple of beers and glasses of house wine for well under €40. No wonder there is always a queue. For lunch i had the hot pork loin and peppers baguette on the limited outside pavement seating area. This was that good i had to have another half a one. Overall a definite recommend the wait is worth it."
2393,9-04-2016 ,4.0,"This tapas restaurant provides indoor founter seats, outdoor settings and table services. It is very popular for tourist and locals alike. We ordered Grilled small fish, artichokes, cod, mushroom and asparagus. We also ordered Jamon iberic with toast etc. They were all delicious. You can watch the chef preparing your dishes behind the counter. The service waiter was very efficient, helpful and explained dishes in English. You need to be there early to minimise waiting time. Price is reasonable."
2394,7-04-2016 ,5.0,"Delicious tapas. A friend who has lived in Barca before recommended it, and what a recommendation it was! We had the prawns which were something else, and also the beef which was top notch and tender as anything. The calamari was so so but we ordered a garlic mayo dip to go with it after we saw it came with no dip, and it was without a doubt the best garlic mayonnaise I have ever tasted (and I have tasted a fair few.) Had the lemon cream cake, as have seen it recommended on trip, and again it was scrumptious! The sangria was alright. Overall definitely worth a visit. "
2395,6-04-2016 ,5.0,This is a restaurant that offers some of the reatest tapas in town. We Love it and we come here often. It is well known in town and we recommend it to both locals and foreigners.
2396,6-04-2016 ,5.0,"We came to the Cervecería aroun 3 pm and had to wait for about 10 minutes. There were 2 waiters taking our orders: one taking the drinks order and another one taking the food order. We had the drink order taken efficiently, but had to wait for the food order to be taken. The food was excellent and the atmosphere very pleasant. Overall a good experience."
2397,6-04-2016 ,5.0,"We live just 1 block away and we went to this restaurant 3 times, 2 times for b/fast, 1 time for brunch. The best value and quality given its location and the high quality of food, the baguettes are the best I've had in Barcelona as a traveler. Highly recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood!"
2398,5-04-2016 ,4.0,"Fantastic tapas at very reasonable price in good location. We went there at 9pm and we were seated at the bar straight away. Great food, nice cava and a bit of chit chat with the staff and other customers, superb lively evening."
2399,4-04-2016 ,3.0,"We decided to check out this place today, after being recommended by a friend who went. Also seeing the great reviews it had online it seemed like a sure thing. The restaurant is very classy, we almost felt a little under dressed. It was busy however we were seated right away. They had an English menu, however not so for the 'specials of the day"" menu, which was separate and in Spanish only. We had the sampler tapas plate, the razor clams special, and another tapas plate (I can't remember the name but it was like really thin fries topped with eggs--delish) and a bottle of wine for about $47 euros. Overall the food was great, however I thought the service was really underwhelming and actually was a bit off putting. Our initial waiter was very impatient with us, was pushy and rushed us to order even though we had questions about the menu. This was annoying because this place certainly was not a cheap place (quite swanky actually) and for the money your putting down you should have wait staff that's a bit more patient and nice to their customers. This guy didn't smile once and just seemed annoyed with our questions. He then disappeared and we suddenly had someone else checking in on us (this guy was a bit better). As we were walking out I noticed you can sit at the bar...I probably would do this if we ever go back. Not sure if I would recommend this place as there are plenty of good tapas places here, and you'll be treated a bit better probably elsewhere. "
2400,4-04-2016 ,4.0,"We visited this place twice and had to wait for 30 minutes each time before getting a seat. It is that popular. There are cafes and bars everywhere so not too much of a problem. The food is great, had the assorted tapas plate as well as the many variations of squid/ seafood. Also quite reasonably priced. "
2401,4-04-2016 ,2.0,"Perhaps indeed the best tapas of Barcelona, however ... it is a tourist-factory-tapasbar. Nothing authentic beside the food. We were there at a thursdaynight around 20 h. and had to wait for more than an hour. Let's be honest : the food is gorgeous ! But apart of (some) staff, I didn't notice any spanish people. I did see french, german, japanese, american, ... customers. So, this food somewhere else, ... fantastic. It was hurry, hurry, so the next customer could sit down, not cosy, not a nice 'experience'. But if you're not looking for a nice evening out, and are just looking for great food : do go there !"
2402,3-04-2016 ,4.0,"A good quality/price restaurant, i would recommend it while visiting barcelona. They have a wide selection of tapas, friendly service, and you can taste everything barcelona has to offer. It is recommended to go early or after 10:00 to avoid large cues. They serve food till late."
2403,2-04-2016 ,4.0,I've lived here a couple of years but never came. Very nice fresh and fast. Would come again. Best was the seafood and the mini burger. 
2404,2-04-2016 ,3.0,"We ordered asparagus and mushrooms, patas bravas, and the fried artichokes. The portions were too small to share unless all you wanted was a taste. The items came quickly. The staff was efficient but not friendly. I thought it was expensive given the size of the portions. I really didn't like the sauce that came with the bravas. It was an uninspired pizza sauce. Yuck. I loved the fried artichoke. It was thinly shaved and fried. They were a little greasy, however. The asparagus was cooked perfectly. Too bad it was only 2 spears cut in half. We left hungry. "
2405,2-04-2016 ,3.0,"It is OK but not sure why this is iconic... we had some tapas, wine and ice cream, all Ok, but not more than that.I'm puzzled about the name... I saw only one catalonian beer in the menu and only major brands which you get everywhere..."
2406,2-04-2016 ,3.0,"1. Getting a table. You have to give your name and the number of people, but the person you have to give it to is past two bars that you just sit at, so it's difficult to work out if you're in the right queue or not. Once you've given your name you just have to wait until she calls you, but it's quite awkward as the place is so busy.2. The food was fine - some dishes came out cold though. The inside of the restaurant is nice. Once you've got to your table it's a good dining experience."
2407,1-04-2016 ,3.0,"Okay food, but not great say other reviews which is a fair comment. the food is okay but not amazing and the service is good but marred by the busy stream of tourists pouring into the place. The beer selection underwhelmed from what we would normall expect and some taps were a little below par. Though there wre a couple that were okay. We were sqeezed into a corner and our party could hardly breath even though we go there early, it is just the way it is all set out. Worth a try but Barcelona offers so much more, but not our worst experience so worth a try."
2408,31-03-2016 ,5.0,Excellent food and service. Very popular and don't accept reservations so you have to come and stand in line.But it worthily!
2409,31-03-2016 ,4.0,"my boyfriend and i were recommended by our friends to this place. we went there for a quick snack at 11 am and the place was full of people.we ordered three tapas, one fried cuttlefish, one goat cheese and one fried chicken ball. all of them are tasty. we like the cuttlefish the most. the fried chicken ball tasted really soft and smooth. a little bit pricy but really worth to recommend. "
2410,30-03-2016 ,3.0,"My husband and I had very high expectations for this place as we had seen the reviews and were told by a friend that this was one of the best meals he had. Perhaps because of that we felt a bit disappointed overall. The food was okay but it wasn't amazing (we had much better elsewhere) and the service was mediocre. Our waiter was helpful but it's a busy restaurant so we couldn't always get his attention. Even getting the attention of some of the other servers around was hard. Overall, quite average."
2411,30-03-2016 ,5.0,"If you come to Barcelona you have to have dinner here. Do not get a table just sit at the bar. The tapas are in front of you, ask the bartender the ones you like. We tried almost all of the tapas and all of them was so delicious. The price is right, atmosphere is great you feel very local."
2412,30-03-2016 ,4.0,"One of the most amazing place in Barcelona !Incredible tapas, friendly atmosphere and top service, not to be missed when you're on Ramblas "
2413,28-03-2016 ,5.0,best prawns. tapas restuarant with a large menu but always nice nad fresh. also wine are great and price are not too expensive. only problem that is very touristic and always busy but overall greattt
2414,28-03-2016 ,5.0,As part of the Rambla Del Mar I was surprised to find somewhere with very reasonable prices. 4 Drinks for less than 6 Euros.Nice position alongside the waterfront.
2415,28-03-2016 ,4.0,"We ordered the Assorted Tapas which came with clams, fried cuttlefish, grilled prawns, fried hot green peppers, and croquettes. We also ordered on the side, calamari and patatas bravas.The patatas bravas were ok - I've had better in Barcelona.The assorted tapas was good though if you enjoy seafood ! I really loved their hot green peppers. We also got cava sangria, which was pretty delicious (Orange-based). Overall a good restaurant! If you don't want to wait 2 hours just for a table, I suggest going earlier - we went around 5:30 pm and didn't have to wait for a table of 6."
2416,26-03-2016 ,4.0,"We had to wait for a table at 11:30 PM but it was worth it. Tapas were excellent with many choices, service was professional and friendly. Will go back next time I am in Barcelona."
2417,25-03-2016 ,3.0,"We went here because a friend recommended the place. We were disappointed. We did not book a table and waited for 45 minutes. It was not worth it. The food was OK but not great, and it was noisy and very busy. Really noisy. I had to put some pieces of paper in my ears. The tables were placed so that waiters passed you all the time. "
2418,24-03-2016 ,5.0,Found this place and ended up going back several time. Busy times unable to get a table but the tapas are incredible. Friendly service and reasonable prices. Try the canapés anchoas but everything is fresh and delicious
2419,24-03-2016 ,3.0,"It's that place where everybody has been recommended to go. With years is more tourist-like rather than local, but still a good option if you are aroundService is good and tapas too"
2420,24-03-2016 ,5.0,Very fresh and we'll prepared tapas. Quick and courteous staff. Will come back.ķt5Fresh seafood and fish. Excellent vinegar small sardines and calamari. 
2421,23-03-2016 ,5.0,"Great atmosphere in a good area of Barcelona. Fantastic tapas! Got in super quick without a reservation, yet the restaurant was still nearly full."
2422,23-03-2016 ,3.0,"We went her for some tapas, was recommended as a 'not too touristy' place. The place is large and the tapas were good. The atmosphere was a bit 'clinical', not very cozy, not very warm or friendly. One cleaning lady dressed in white was constantly mopping the floor around customers. The place must be clean!"
2423,22-03-2016 ,4.0,"The Food Is great, very nice small tapes,butthe waiters is bit annoying because they rush you all the time"
2424,22-03-2016 ,5.0,"This is exactly what you visualize a great tapas bar/restaurant to be. Very busy bar area as you enter, full of locals at any time of day, then through to the restaurant which is the same. I had a quiet doubt that it was so busy we might have to wait for a table and slow service (and given that we were heading for the Barca v Arsenal game we didn't have loads of time) but the service was so slick and efficient - they clearly have it all worked out. Food was great and a great variety of 'non-anglified' dishes - yes we had 'patatas bravas' and calamari, but the local dishes were delicious and so far as I could tell, were freshly cooked. Good wine list also - again with a good mix of well known and local brands.Go anytime as it's open early to late - very popular after work, but as I said, the service is well oiled and you won't wait long."
2425,21-03-2016 ,5.0,"great tapas great taste. beef tenderloin and patotoes with garlic souce was perfect. there are so many other tasty tapas. try as much as you can, you will definitely love it"
2426,21-03-2016 ,5.0,Absolutely great experience.Either by siting in the restaurant or in the balcony. Tapas are always great with an absolutely perfect quality.Should be on your visit in any way!!
2427,20-03-2016 ,2.0,"I tried the razor clams and calamari. Both were overcooked and rubbery. Also tried the croquettes, artichoke, jamon, potatas bravas, and hamburger. None of them stood out as better than average. I did like the fried hot peppers but my girlfriend didn't. Would not recommend or go back. "
2428,20-03-2016 ,5.0,"It's worth the wait and the price --slightly above average but so is the quality of the food.While waiting for a table you can sit at the bar and have some delicious pinxos --the smoked salmon was just heavenly. The tables are big and the chairs are comfortable, which really makes a difference --especially if going with children, like we did. My kids took out their pens and papers to draw while we waited for the food, something your cannot normally do in other cervecerias with tiny tables. There's a restroom with a baby changing unit, this was a very pleasant surprise I wasn't expecting.As for the food, the menu is perhaps a bit limited but the waiters have wonderful suggestions and the food + the beer were in any case great. Highly recommended!"
2429,19-03-2016 ,4.0,"Every time we walked past day or night it was overflowing.... So on the sat night we took a chance, put our names on the 1hr 15 min waiting list and was very pleased we did.... Staff were polite, prices were pretty decent and the food was spot on, if you can hold out for a table then do so..."
2430,19-03-2016 ,5.0,"Great place to eat and drink. Very good tapas, service and atmosphere. Arrive early for dinner time (7pm) if you don't want to wait long. All dishes are well done."
2431,19-03-2016 ,4.0,"Been here twice and had a good time. The food is nice, the service ok. On weekends it tends to be really busy."
2432,19-03-2016 ,5.0,"Lovely tapas restaurant. Always busy and great atmosphere. Friendly, helpful staff.The food was amazing, we visited twice during our 3 night stay in Barcelona. Everything was fresh, tasted beautiful and lots of choice! Even for my ten year old son, it encouraged him to try things he hadn't tried before but they also had little tapas for him such as mini burgers and hotdogs! No rushing, even though was busy we could leisurely eat and drink, perfect! Would visit again! *****"
2433,18-03-2016 ,5.0,We were recommended to go by staff at our hotel and the high reputation is rightly deserved. Friendly staff and wide range of Tapas. Be prepared to wait for table but it is worth the wait.
2434,17-03-2016 ,5.0,"The best tapas I have ever had!We had the beef tenderloin, pork, jamon, croquette, prawns, peppers, patatas bravas and one was as nice as the next!Great atmosphere and buzz in the place too, you'll have to wait to get a seat more than likely but it's well worth the wait."
2435,16-03-2016 ,4.0,"good enough quality for an spanish costumer like me, very well located next to Passeig de gracia, professional and fast service if you are touring with people around the city and need a good enough place to stop for an hour."
2436,16-03-2016 ,5.0,We loved it. Was recommended to us by a local as one of the better tapas restaurants that locals go to
2437,16-03-2016 ,4.0,Service was excellent and so was the food. Waitress was a nice and attentive. Its a little ways walk up but worth it. I recommend getting the fried hot green peppers and the Catalana style eggs.
2438,16-03-2016 ,3.0,"I am from Barcelona and have eaten here uncountable times, I brought all my foreign friends and family, since it used to be the best tapas restaurant I knew. Until yesterday. Don't take me wrong, food isn't bad. But it used to be much more delicious. Bread was too oily and barely has tomato on it (Catalan style is with tomato spread), calamari were soft as if cooked a while ago and being reheated, as well as the padrón peppers. Seafood was ok. Nothing outstanding as it used to. The service is fast as usual, but maybe too fast to serve good. It seems the restaurant took too much the focus on turists and it forgot about its great kitchen. I'm not sure I'll come back soon, I'm in the hope to find somewhere better... "
2439,16-03-2016 ,5.0,"We've tried several tapas places while in Barcelona and Madrid but feeling meh about the whole tapas experience. This place changed all that. We arrived at 1030 and we're told that we'd be waiting 45 mins for a table. Don't bother calling,they don't take reservations. The outside tables were a 20 min wait so we opted for that. William who was our waiter took charge when we asked for his recommendations! A tapas onslaught shortly followed and it was non stop food Porn. Egg creado. Was delicious Shrimp on bread. Also delicious. Mushrooms with asparagus. Very nice. Beef tenderloin thingy tapas was excellent. William da man! A great dinner experience on our last night in Barcelona. Highly recommended."
2440,16-03-2016 ,4.0,"Wide selection of tapas maded from a good quaility materials, quick and nice service, well priced. Nothing else to say..."
2441,15-03-2016 ,5.0,"I love this place. I forgot how many times I've been there and is always a great experience. Good to go with friends, family or for a work meeting...And the food is the best!"
2442,14-03-2016 ,5.0,"Have to say this was the best tapas I have ever eaten. Very efficient service, delicious food & lovely bottle of Rioja.Can't rate this place highly enough!"
2443,14-03-2016 ,4.0,"Use to have lot of foreigners people in Barcelona and its a nice place to have tapas but like local place, very good quality and variety. Nice choice of beers. nice atmosphere."
2444,13-03-2016 ,5.0,"Queues of locals definately a good sign. Food was well prepared,served and good value.A modern take on tapas and beautifully presented.Well worth seeking out."
2445,13-03-2016 ,4.0,"This place is vibrant and very popular. Hence a long wait, we waited around 45 mins and consumed 2 nice Estrellas at the bar. The menu is nice and I liked the seafood options, quite tasty. Thought the beef tenderloin was just OK. Very reasonably priced"
2446,12-03-2016 ,5.0,"We asked a local where to get the best tapas and paella, and he recommended this place. Unfortunately, there was no paella, but we stayed and had great tapas. We also had a pitcher of sangria. All of the tapas were really good (beef tenderloin, hot green peppers, patatas bravas, shrimp prawns, brie, to name a few) and we also recommended this place to others when we met people looking for the best tapas! As other have said, the wait was long, but there are a lot of shops nearby so we browsed a few stores and came back and it was time to eat."
2447,11-03-2016 ,5.0,We were staying in a hotel just a block away and thought we would try it.It was very busy but the staff were very helpful advising us what to try etc. Our food and wine was excellent and although there were people waiting there was no pressure to vacate the table.We would recommend it.
2448,11-03-2016 ,4.0,"We visited Cerveceria Catalana for tapas after being recommended by our hotel. After a long day of walking, the three minute walk was too tempting to pass up. We both really enjoyed the food. We did not feel very relaxed though, almost as if it were fast food tapas. The service felt very hurried and the restaurant was absolutely packed, so if you want a laid back evening I'd suggest swerving this restaurant. "
2449,11-03-2016 ,4.0,I was recommended by local friend as a very good choice for tourist in Barcelona. Good environment with resonable price.
2450,11-03-2016 ,4.0,We loved all tapas we had . We knew it's going to be pricey and busy but didn't know how many people will skip the que . They don't take reservations for the tables . Very good luck to everyone ;)
2451,10-03-2016 ,5.0,Great street side tables. Food was awesome and service was great. We had someone with us that spoke Spanish so ordering off of the daily special menu was easy. There was an English menu. The waiter was very helpful.
2452,10-03-2016 ,5.0,"Have been in Barcelona for a week and ate there 4 times: simply great experience, great food and great ambiance - avoid rush hours "
2453,9-03-2016 ,5.0,It was very busy when we arrived but were given a table right away. We had a variety of tapas and wine and beer. The second vice was very good and the wait staff were attentive. Had several people take care of us.I would recommend if you are in the neighborhood.
2454,9-03-2016 ,4.0,"It's big and it's busy and it deserves to be. Great service, great menu, great kitchen, great atmosphere, altogether a great going-on, this has to be one of Barcelona's top places for a proper Spanish/Catalan lunch - itself a thing to be celebrated. Our lunch choices included a generous platter of Iberico ham, Pa amb Tomaquet, fried Boquerones, Calamari and a terrific timbale of Escalivada, topped with goats' cheese. Add to this a lovely bottle of Torres de Casta rose, mineral water and service, and walk away full and very happy having spent 40 Euros for the lot. A great lunch at a great place for a great price. That's value."
2455,9-03-2016 ,4.0,A very good tapas bar - food was excellent. The service could be better. We saw many customers struggling to order from the waiting staff. That said chefs were very good.
2456,9-03-2016 ,3.0,"Very busy restaurant with an hour and 15 minutes wait for a table on a busy Saturday. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited, drinks are very reasonably priced and it was under 5 euros for a beer and a white wine! The food was average, but the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Not the best tapas in Barcelona as indicated, overall the meal was OK, but we wouldn't return."
2457,8-03-2016 ,3.0,"I am willing to concede that we went on an ""off"" night but this is definitely not the best place for tapas in Barcelona. My husband's brother is in town and wanted to try some local fare. Against my better judgment, we decided to try something new and after a Google search for the best tapas in Barcelona, ended up here. At 1930, the place was packed with tourists including very large groups of Asian tourists (admittedly this is not Spanish dinner time so maybe they were saving the good food until then.) We ordered 7 items and were really disappointed with the quality. The pulpo/octopus and mussels were overcooked; The squid was chewy (as someone in my party commented, ""like you get in a North American chain restaurant""); The pan con tomate was soggy and not on the right kind of bread: The pimientos padron? Fried to squishiness. All this said, the place is not without its positives. The vegetables were tasty and grilled to perfection and the fried artichokes light and crispy. The service was also very friendly and quick...but as someone mentioned above, we also got the feeling that this was only to get us in and out the door to make way for more tourists. We won't be back."
2458,7-03-2016 ,4.0,"Very busy restaurant with a 30 min wait for a table so we sat at the bar.The tapas were very good especially the Pulpo è Gambas (Octopus) with prawn on a slice of fried potato which was the stand out dish for us.The Pulpo Gallega, bacalao and croquets were all excellent as was the smoked anchovies.The beer was very popular with the customers, the wine list was ok but the selection of wines by the glass could be better as there were only 3 to choose from, otherwise it would be a 5 star review. "
2459,6-03-2016 ,4.0,"We visited this place twice! That probably says enough how good the place is. There does not seem that many on the menu, but we still feel that there is a lot to try. The baguette is simply delicious, quite small, but nice! Very nice!First we did not know what to choose, so we ordered the assorted tapas which consisted of seashells, prawns, fried calamari, croquette, grilled green pepper. Not bad! Deep fried sliced artichokes were interestingly tasty. Other things like stuffed red chili with cod puree, anchovy opened sandwich, California salad, etc. all very nice.Staff were all very cheerful and attentive despite long queue.Price-wise? Very inexpensive!"
2460,5-03-2016 ,5.0,"fantastic restuarant, very nice athmospere and food its cooked right in front of you. we were seated in the stalls in front of the entrance and have enjoyed 2 long ours of great catalan food. definitely suggested. only neative point, too crowd"
2461,5-03-2016 ,5.0,"Great atmosphere, friendly and professional service and, most importantly, fabulous tapas.We stopped by for lunch after a great day half day visit of la Sagrada Familia, all of us, adults and kids were delighted"
2462,5-03-2016 ,3.0,went there as had eaten at Ciudad Condal which we loved and told this place was owned by same person. The disappointment was that the menu was exactly the same as Ciudad Condal .. but in saying that the food really is excellent .. however ambiance was not good and service was poor .. unlike Ciudad Condal .. would not go back here because of this ... be prepared to wait for your table .. 
2463,5-03-2016 ,5.0,"Crowded place in the evening, worth to wait for a table! This restaurant offers only different type of tapas. All of them I tasted were delicious! One of the best in Barcelona. Highly recommended :)"
2464,4-03-2016 ,4.0,"Delicious.We put our name on the list at 9pm on a Friday, had drinks at a nearby rooftop bar and then got seated at about 10 pm. We stayed away from the kind of tapas you can buy at the delicatessen (sliced cheeses and hams) and ordered the marinated artichokes (mouthwatering), croquettes (best I've ever had), patatas bravas (ok), beef tenderloin (tender & flavorful) and the grilled spring onions with romanesc sauce (absolutely amazing!!).The meal was superb, and completely reasonably priced given the quality. However, the sangria was a little too sweet and not very interesting, so I'd recommend beer or wine.The crema catalan was perfectly decent for dessert, but the tapas were by far the highlight. "
2465,3-03-2016 ,5.0,"Here is the best tapas in Barcelona. Ate here 3X in 4 days, had business dinners and happy hour at the tapas bar. Excellent food and service high quality and excellent service. Highly recommended but doesn't take reservations and always a bit of a wait."
2466,3-03-2016 ,4.0,"Had the huevos cabreaos, salteado del dia (sautéed ham, mushrooms and asparagus) and pescadito frito (fried mini sardines). Especially liked the last two. The huevos are filling so better to share when there are a few people. "
2467,2-03-2016 ,5.0,"We waited 45 minutes for a table on a Wednesday evening in March! Worth every second. The vibe was great as was the service. And, the food was excellent! The bill was a little over 100€ for 4 adults. This included sangria, lots of tapas and delicious dessert! I highly recommend. "
2468,2-03-2016 ,3.0,This place came highly recommended and we went out of our way and waited some time to get a table. The food was very average - the patatas bravas and mini burgers were fine but the squid special was tough and the tortilla was very average. As tourists I felt we were being rushed so they could fill the table again. Definitely not on our agenda again.
2469,2-03-2016 ,3.0,"Went on a Sunday night and this restaurant the busiest in the area by far. Despite queue only a short wait to get seated. Tapas almost exclusively fish-based. Couple of dishes we fancied were off the menu. Good location in nice area, great atmosphere and lively venue but very disappointed with the food quality I'm afraid. Judging by the crowds they must be doing something right but not for me."
2470,1-03-2016 ,5.0,"I decided to go there as it was recommended to me by a local, plus I read the excellent reviews online. The place surpassed my expectations. The food was delicious. The service friendly and quick. The staff were kind to recommend few dishes and tehy were very tasty. Traditional spanish tapas and cold beer. If you are looking for authentic tapas experience, look no further!"
2471,1-03-2016 ,5.0,#1 restaurant for me on our recent visit to Barcelona. Tapas were AMAZING. Sangria beyond amazing!! Service very good...I would have eaten there every night if we could have! 
2472,29-02-2016 ,5.0,"Went in for a quick bite and based on the waitress' recommendations, ordered a few for a light lunch and the food was awesome. "
2473,28-02-2016 ,5.0,"Fantastic tapas here. Went for a long tapas lunch with my mum, and we ordered countless small dishes and also had a litre of sangria between us! Food was delicious, service was great and the location is fab - right near Passeig Gracia. All in all came to 60EUR between us - which we thought was really good value. Mum commented it was the best tapas she had ever had. Would recommend!"
2474,27-02-2016 ,4.0,We arrived around 7:30 pm. and waited for over half an hour for a table. The food was very good and worth the wait. Service was very attentive and there was no problem communicating with the servers in English. The restaurant is very modern with lots of ambience. Very reasonably priced.
2475,25-02-2016 ,5.0,You have to come between 6-7pm otherwise it is 45 to 60 min wait.Huge selection of tapas and the waiters are very helpful to give assistance to select food. 
2476,25-02-2016 ,5.0,It's worth the queue! They also have a wide variety of beers. Highly recommended to go there! Ask for typical catalán tapas. 
2477,25-02-2016 ,5.0,"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere. Excellent wine list of mostly local wine, try the Mauro! Fantastic wine. It is very busy so go early or later in the evening. If you don't your patience will be awarded!"
2478,24-02-2016 ,3.0,Worth doing once during a stay in Barcelona. Extremely busy when we went - 40 minute wait. Food was innovative and tasty. Don't think these are the best tapas in Barcelona but more geared towards the tourist market.. Still it was a fun and happy experience.
2479,24-02-2016 ,5.0,"Every time I visit Barcelona (and I do go there quite often) I end up dining here everyday. Pleasant and vivid environment, amazing food, perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients. One of my favourite restaurants in the world!"
2480,23-02-2016 ,4.0,"Delicious lunch and always keep your eyes so you can see what others are ordering and if it looks good get it!! Very good quality, delicate frying, fresh fish, excellent jamon, and canas. "
2481,23-02-2016 ,4.0,"I have read a good reviews from this restaurant and we wanted to try, food was very taste only thing for not write 5 stars was big que to wait for a table"
2482,23-02-2016 ,4.0,"Very clean, too many staff and smiling face.Quite alot tapas and seem very delicious. Easy to find. The prices are OK. You may find cheaper Tapas but you may have dlfficulty to find similar or better taste."
2483,23-02-2016 ,4.0,We went there twice once at lunch time once at dinner. Both times the service is extremely quick and efficient there are a lot of staff so you will always have someone on hand to either remove your plates or order more. They are also very friendly so they are always willing to suggest new things to try. But it is extremely busy so if you can you should book in advance as when we went for supper we arrived at 9.30 and the waiting time was 1 &1/2 hrs but you can go for a walk and come back at the time they tell you so you don't have to wait there. Also worth mentioning are the homemade desserts as we couldn't make up our mind we had the cake sampler and was enough for us and 3 more tables!!! 
2484,22-02-2016 ,5.0,"Visited it as our last meal in Barcelona, I wish it was our first so we could have eaten more of the delicious food. The bread was amazing, tapas so varied and tasty. There was something for everyone even my one year old baby."
2485,22-02-2016 ,5.0,"Long wait of about an hour for our group of 5, however the wait was worth it once we tasted the food...so delicious!!!We had a great waiter, he spoke English, he basically ordered for our group and it was perfect! He recommended quite a few things which we didn't originally think to order and it was the best. Some of the favorite items were: beef sliders, beef tenderloin, ham plate, cheese plate. "
2486,22-02-2016 ,5.0,Everyone was so nice and welcoming!We has an amazing time and the food is amazing. It is definitely worth the waiting time.
2487,21-02-2016 ,5.0,"Ive been recommended to go to Cerveceria many times and from different people.So today as I started my day discovering the city walking I decided to have as a final destination this place. And I loved it.It was the first time I go out and have a meal all by myself. I actually loved it. I got there and I knew the place from the people waiting in line for their turn to get a table -you should wait at least 30 mins to get a table- and no one had any problem waiting for this good food.But if you don't want a table, you can be seated on the bar directly -if there are any empty chairs- and I think the bar experience is amazing, you see all the food in front of you and the bartender helps you with the whole order. I had a seat on the bar since I was all by myself and wasn't going to wait half an hour for a table for one :)!I had some the chicken salad and I do not recommend it because it is not that good especially comparing to what I tasted later on.Then I had the Octopus Tapa -Good but a bit spicy-, afterwards some Mussels - very good ones- , followed by a mini burger that I really loved with the patty that is rare to medium rare, and cheese and onions that give it a very good taste -I recommend to order more than one because it is so good but the portion is micro not mini:) -, and ended it with a steak on bread (the first one on the tapas menu, i dont remember the name because i just told the bartender i wanted a beef steak).I couldn't have deserts afterwards because I was full but the next visist Im definitely going to leave space for deserts!I highly recommend this place because the food is amazing and the design is nice and relaxing.Id give it a 9.5/10 !"
2488,21-02-2016 ,5.0,"We ate here from the reviews and recommendations, tapas was great we tried many different dishes and service was good too. Tables are a little close together but it seems from our experience that's the norm in Barcelona!"
2489,20-02-2016 ,5.0,"Lots of great food supper fresh and could not get enough. Two hour wait for a table at 8:30pm on a Saturday. Waited for 40 minutes for a seat to open up at the bar, well worth the wait. Do know if you don't have a seat at the bar you cannot get food. (Although you can get drinks) Will be back again soon. "
2490,20-02-2016 ,4.0,"Great place we went for for lunch whilst staying in Barcelona , it's Tapas cooked as you wait . Great atmosphere , defiantly a must with many of the locals present .Would highly recommend here with a good price for all the dishes ."
2491,20-02-2016 ,5.0,"We visited Barcelona to take a close look at tapas. You can find tapas everywhere and they are mostly quite good. Cerveceria Catalana is just a lot better than most. The variety and quality of the food is spectacular and the staff (more than half of whom are Filipino<read efficient, friendly,polyglot>) just bring on a continuous stream of delicious offerings.It is easy to be overwhelmed and bewildered by the choices available. You will need a waiter or barman to help you figure things out.There are only two drawbacks. 1. The place gets packed. 2. Your standard for tapas will have been raised too high.So, go early (6ish), sit at the bar, ask Ruel to take care of you, and have a wonderful time."
2492,19-02-2016 ,4.0,We stopped here after a day at Monsterrat. I had read about it in quite a few travelers guides. It did not disappoint. We had multiple tapas and multiple glasses of wine. There was a 30 min wait which I heard can happen and it was worth it!To top the greatness of... Our bill was 29 euros. I could not believe it!I highly recommend!
2493,17-02-2016 ,4.0,"Six of us dined and we had a great experience. The octopus was fabulous and so was all of the seafood.It was alittle noisier than expected. The service was excellent, friendly waiter."
2494,16-02-2016 ,5.0,De food was really really good! Fast en good service! You have to go when you love tapas ! We had to wait 45 minutes but no problem because it's worth it!
2495,16-02-2016 ,5.0,Dropped by this busy resto/bar for a quick meal and wanted to spend the whole day once we sat down. It's located in the newer section of Barcelona near shopping for the brands we all know. This type of shopping isn't my cup of tea but Casa Batllo was near here and we wanted to see it. The service is quick and the food was heavenly. Ordered grilled cuttlefish on the servers recommendation and could not have been happier. Definitely recommended.There's also a patio and bar area. If you sit at the bar you can see many of the tasty dishes they offer.
2496,15-02-2016 ,3.0,"Visited early evening on a Friday, it was very busy but got a table after 30 mins. Nice atmosphere and tapas was good, however the mussels and langoustines were very fishy and didn't seem fresh."
2497,15-02-2016 ,4.0,"Here it is always crowded, but for a good reason. The food is delicious and absolutely worth the waiting time to get a table. It has become a huge restaurant and can not be called intimate, but has a busy vibrant athmosphere."
2498,15-02-2016 ,4.0,"Here the food is amazing. They definitely have one of the best tapas in town. I like it and I have visited here couple of times already but the only thing is that the staff is not very friendly. They take order and serve you but it's very systematic and I can understand the staffs are busy, but a little more friendliness and care from the staff would make this place very nice. Hence this place lacks the warmth of a nice restaurant. But the food is good, not too expensive and I can't complain too much since after all I'll probably go back there again! "
2499,14-02-2016 ,4.0,"I went there with colleagues and it was simply perfect. It was warm and we stayed outside, there are 4-5 tables. We had a mix of tapas and a couple of fish-based dishes with differet type of beers. The place was completly full of people but we were lucky to find a table. I will not miss to go again in this place next time I'll be in Barcelona. Probably I will make a reservation!"
2500,14-02-2016 ,5.0,"I visited this restaurant 2 years ago, and went back last night with my boyfriend. All I can say is that it is definitely worth the wait as there can be a long queue sometimes. 45 minute wait for our table host could not have been any better she was very informative and made sure we knew when we would be seated! Once seated we ordered a selection of tapas that can only be described as exquisite, the service was fast but not rushed which I think is extremely important, not once did we feel that we had to 'hurry up'. Bill came to around 80 euros with 1.5 litre of sangria and very full stomachs! Highly recommend to anyone visiting this area. "
2501,13-02-2016 ,4.0,"Excellent tapas, a lot of variety to choose from, good service. It is a little bit too noisy but it is totally worth the visit."
2502,11-02-2016 ,4.0,Great service and great food. Love the many different fresh made tapa's. Get the Pimento de Padron. Lovely....
2503,11-02-2016 ,5.0,"we have loved ur sunday dinner here, was such a special place where youu can find the real essence of barcelona cataloninan food. the tapas bar its perfect and rawns and croquetas are if the best quality!!!"
2504,10-02-2016 ,5.0,"We have visited this restaurant before for dinner while in Barcelona, but this time, we came for Sunday lunch. It was busy by noon but they had tables available. The service was attentive and friendly. They offer an English menu. Half-bottle of red Wine with four tapas plates was less than $25 for two people. We also saw lots of families with children."
2505,10-02-2016 ,5.0,Salesperson at Chanel recommended this place. We went there early on Friday evening without a reservation. To eat inside the restaurant was impossible so we opted for a table outside. The host/waiter seated us within 10 mins. We were overwhelmed by the many types of tapas so we trusted the waiter to chose for us. We were not disappointed in the least. Great food and the prices are decent. We liked the place so much we came back the next evening. The line was horrendous. Luckily the waiter remembered us and he gave us a seat within 5 mins. Definitely must try.
2506,10-02-2016 ,4.0,"We have visited this amazing place after a recommendation of a friend. Thanks for the recommendation, it was a great experience! We needed to stop by to make a reservation earlier that night, and we knew why later that night. Fully packed and buzzing! We had a great time with lots of delicious tapas and sangria! Every time we visit Barca we make sure we are cisiting this place!"
2507,10-02-2016 ,5.0,"We went here for dinner - long wait but well worth it. We ended up seated at the bar after waiting about 20 minutes for a table and were so well looked after there that we passed on the table when it was ready. Where to start - vegetable timbales, artichokes - anything with artichokes - amazing prawns and scallops - skip the potatoes and other standard tapas fare as their offerings are so incredible. But do not miss the crusty brie - save it as your last course as it could be dessert.We returned for a leisurely lunch on Sunday and there was no wait. Visit their other restaurant as well - our 2nd favourite tapas restaurant - Cuidad Condal - great bar area here and packed but expect very long waits."
2508,9-02-2016 ,5.0,"The food here was very good, and it was quite friendly prices. Very busy place, but the food arrived quickly and the service was excellent!"
2509,9-02-2016 ,4.0,"We had an enjoyable lunch at Cerveseria Catalana. The food was good, the service was friendly and efficient. As we were leaving, the kitchen was delivering plate loads of tapas and other appealing looking dishes to the bar area. We wish we had been able to partake of these offerings. Unfortunatel, we were leaving the next day or we would have returned."
2510,9-02-2016 ,5.0,"During my last trip to Barcelona I had to stop back in here 3 times because it is so good! The restaurant has a great atmosphere and you can drop in by yourself as the bar seating makes for an enjoyable eating experience! If you go as a group, get there early as every time I was there, a line-up and wait was present. Especially weekends. But the food and price are both excellent and worth the trip and wait!! Must visit!!"
2511,9-02-2016 ,4.0,"The restaurant is centrally located, always crowded with locals and tourists. Nice food. The only thing is they do not offer you any tapa with the drink, which is something very common in all around Spain. Thus you have to wait a long time with your drink with nothing to bite, of course unless you order and pay for it.."
2512,9-02-2016 ,5.0,"It is very well prepared tapas, hot and cold. I usually go there for breakfast around 9am. My favorite dish is la flauta de jamon iberico. My breakfast is always topped with Cafe con leche and orange juice (freshly squeezed)"
2513,8-02-2016 ,4.0,Lovely meal with colleagues. Fast helpful service. The food was tasty and came hot and fresh to the table. It was very busy however staff where very attentive and helpful. One sister even advised me to keep my bag nearby incase of theft. Brilliant place!! 
2514,7-02-2016 ,5.0,"Great value, delicious and wonderful evening. It is worth the wait so do not bother if you are not interested in that aspect. We arrived at 10:30 (pm!) with a 45 minute wait but were lucky to sit at the bar after 20 mins or so and enjoy Gambas and other delicious tapas ... "
2515,5-02-2016 ,5.0,"From the second we set down until we were through 11/2 hours later this was a remarkable experience. The food was to die for and the wine was perfect. Service was second to none. We had our daughter, son-in-law and five grandchildren ranging from 6 months - 13 years. Thank you Catalana!!!"
2516,5-02-2016 ,5.0,"Excellent food, excellent service and very good location. My favorite place to take my tourist gests out dinning when they want to taste everything from Catalonia and Spain.The only very annoying problem in this place is that they do not accept reservations and they want you to come there, write your name down and stand in the queue wait until you are called which sometimes is one hour or more. The restaurant is not worth waiting that long though...Correct me if I am wrong once you put your name down and they tell you ""in 45min you will be seated"", it is called a reservation now these days. So why I can not just call an hour before and say I´ll be there in an hour instead of waiting out side the restaurant for an hour?!?Recommended off season, high season bring a snack or sandwich while you wait in a queue..."
2517,3-02-2016 ,2.0,"Hmm - have NO idea what the fuss is about this place! I went at 7pm and for seated right away. My waiter was dismissive, impatient and down-right rude - he practically threw the menu on the table and walked away without a word. He then came back to ask if I wanted a drink and between his terrible English and my non existent Spanish we agreed on a half bottle of cheap white plonk (their by-the-glass wine menu was deplorable! He food came lukewarm and terrible underwhelming and was whipped away as soon as I was done. With little to commend it I paid and left and would avoid like the plague If I were you!"
2518,3-02-2016 ,4.0,It was a good that we found the bar quiet. We got a seat and tried their food. Good but not exceptional. Definitely patronised by tourists hence the great reviews.
2519,2-02-2016 ,4.0,We were caught in a massive rainstorm and happened upon this place close to Casa Mila. The place was hopping but there was room at the bar. We quite enjoyed the seafood risotto and the Sangria was one of the strongest we had - no complaints there. Great selection of traditional Tapas.
2520,31-01-2016 ,5.0,Amazing tapas :3 It definitely did not disappoint. What I would suggest is to just order the stuff that you like to eat. I love prawns and octopus so I ordered that. So goooooood! The dilemma is real when choosing what to order. ASK THE WAITERS. They will help. Go all out and order it. No regrets. SO WORTH IT
2521,29-01-2016 ,5.0,Every time I visit this bar it gets better.the atmosphere is superb the staff can not do enough for you the service is second to none.And the main reason for a visit is the food and menu are out of this world.an easy bar to find as everyone knows where it is.
2522,27-01-2016 ,5.0,"In an elegant part of town serving great food is this large restaurant. Walking distance from Catalunya Plaza. We had wonderful clams Galician style, great Navajas, great mussels and superb escaliva at a reasonable price. Great wine and beer selection. There is always a wait for a table but believe me it's worth it."
2523,27-01-2016 ,5.0,The best tapas in Barcelona and the queues testify to this !Great atmosphere and service. The Restaurant starts to get busy from 7pm until the early hours. Wait time can be anything up to 60mins+ but definitely worth the wait. The food is excellent and you will see many of the locals also dinning there. Went to Barcelona for a week and ended up eating here 3 times as it was so popular with the family and such great value for money. We used to order lots of different tapas to try and the waiters were also great at recommending dishes. Make sure you leave room for dessert they are really special and often overlooked !Definitely worth a visit !
2524,27-01-2016 ,5.0,"We visited there twice in 3 days. Our first visit, we got there around 3 pm and people are waiting in line to get a table. We were lucky to get seated at the bar counter right away. Food is excellent, nice presentation and so many choices. We enjoyed fresh seafood and great beer.Second time, we were there around 1 pm and didn't have to wait to get a table. Staff were nice and very helpful, we enjoyed tapas of the day and sangria. We will definitely return there again!"
2525,26-01-2016 ,3.0,"Food is good but nothing exceptional. I don't understand comments saying it's exceptional and that you have to go there...not really. You will just have to wait for a table, then be served by not really nice waitress to have average tasty food. However their patatas bravas and gambas are good (hard to fail gambas anyway). To conclude: average restaurant overrated."
2526,26-01-2016 ,4.0,"There are many good tapas bars, but this one certainly counts to the top 10% in Barcelona. You probably need to wait for about 30-45 minutes, but you can do this at the bar. Very nice food, fresh, original ... allways a good choice"
2527,26-01-2016 ,5.0,"Top of Las Ramblas , very welcoming, swift service, nice feel to the place. Visited 4 times in 5 days, need I say more"
2528,25-01-2016 ,4.0,"I went to this place with high expectations as it was rated the No. 1 tapas bar/restaurant in Barcelona, but nothing was spectacular. The service was ok. The food was good but not mouth watering by any means (and a bit too oily). Atmosphere is fine. It's above average but not spectacular..."
2529,24-01-2016 ,5.0,Very nice restaurant with almost an elegant style!Great dishes you dont know what to order!Plenty of choices and also plenty of people who wait for a table!!Dont go in rush hours if you are in hurry!
2530,24-01-2016 ,5.0,I knew I had to wait about one hour going there .. And actually that was the reality. But it was worth it! In the while you can have a walk and then. Enjoy the best tapas in a fancy atmosphere !
2531,24-01-2016 ,5.0,I was walking by this restaurant and it looked nice and busy so I thought I should give it ago. It was amazing! The tapas were so tasty! Everything was fresh and well cooked. If you want to try proper Catalan cuisine do go there. I am definitely visiting on my next trip.
2532,23-01-2016 ,5.0,"I used to live around the corner and it was one of the first fancier tapa places I discovered. Still one of my favourites, since the tapas are tasty and the atmosphere is vivid! "
2533,23-01-2016 ,5.0,Went many many many times in BCN and definitely the best tapas place. Food is simply amazing !!!Always something new to try. 
2534,23-01-2016 ,5.0,"We loved this place, it was our favourite meal of our trip! Went on a recommendation from our hotel. We arrived about 7.30-8 and luckily got a table, by about 8.30 it was rammed with people queuing out the door! You can either sit at the bar or in the restaurant area (which we did) and can pick food from the restaurant menu or the bar menu. Atomsphere was buzzy and the tapas was AMAZING!! It was also the cheapest dinner of our trip which we couldnt believe as the food was so good. Would definately recommend this restaurant!"
2535,23-01-2016 ,4.0,"After getting a bit lost (my fault) We got here before 9 on a Saturday night. There was a queue and it looked a bit cramped inside. I didn't know what the plan was so I asked a waiter who was tending outside tables how long was the wait and he asked if we wanted to eat inside or outside, as there was a table just becoming free outside. Starving we said outside is perfect, and instant seats! Okay, it was January, but with the heaters it wasn't cold. Food came out fast, we had mixed tapas along with a 4 cheese on bread tapa. The mixed tapas were good, but being outside they went cold quickly. The cheese tapa was one of the best thing I've eaten, we ordered more. Desserts and wine were good, as was service. Lovely meal, would return."
2536,22-01-2016 ,3.0,I took my team for dinner because I remover the place from a visit many years ago. It used to be a charming place. Now it is run as a production line where the purpose is to get as many people through as quick as possible. Very disappointed
2537,21-01-2016 ,5.0,"This establishment has 2 problems:- so many different good things, only so much place in my stomach- because it's so great, you have to anticipate to queue easily 30 minutes before you are seated. Maybe it's possible to reserve, we didn't check.As for the rest, the title says it all. Great to visit by yourself for a quick bite at the bar, as a couple, or with a group of friends."
2538,21-01-2016 ,4.0,I've had very good tapas at the bar: fish tapas mostly and some ham tapas and all were very tasty and delicious. The only negative feedback is about the short time I could stay at the bar as the restaurant was full of people waiting and obviously they made some pressure. So you can stay there as long as you eat. I don't know if on the tables you may stay longer. Anyway very good food. 
2539,21-01-2016 ,5.0,You can sit at the counter and choose all the delicious tapas that are right in front of you :). We went there twice in the evening and sat always at the counter (the place has two long counters and many tables). At some point in the evening there was a huge queue. We came before 7pm and we could always find a place. We've tried different things and we liked everything. Panini with small fishes and red pepper was just the best. Also all the seafood. Red Sangria is better than white. Average bill for 4-5 tapas and 1 litre of Sangria = 30-35 euro.
2540,18-01-2016 ,5.0,It was very good. Delicious tapas and fast service. Modern place. Strongly advised. Consider 20-30 min. waiting before go to table. You can have drink while waiting.
2541,17-01-2016 ,5.0,"Very busy spot but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Really nice tapas, not the cheapest but worth it for a nice date night out. Staff were really helpful with the menu and recommendations."
2542,17-01-2016 ,5.0,"This has got to be the best Tapas restaurant I have ever been to, so good we went twice during our weekend break. The food is so fresh, the service impeccable, the only downside is the wait during busy times, that said its worth it. A must!!"
2543,17-01-2016 ,5.0,"We tried to get dinner - and around 10 it was busy- they told us to wait 45 min... And we went to another place! But- next day we come back there during lunch time , around 3-4. So they have a spot for us! We got tapas, desserts! Such a amazing experience! Food was so great!!! Definitely one of the best place to eat!! Have nice service, and good prices!!!Love it!!!!!"
2544,16-01-2016 ,5.0,"This was our favorite lunch spot in Barcelona. We loved it so much the first time, we made a return visit before leaving for Madrid. They have a very nice selection of tapas and everything we tried was excellent. Keep it mind it does get busy if arriving much after 12:30, but the line did not look too horrible. Once seated you won't regret coming."
2545,15-01-2016 ,5.0,"The food here is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. There is a bit of a wait. First time was 45 minutes, second was 15. Our server Michelle was great, gave us excellent recommendations and explained what the dishes were. I liked the grilled shrimp and my boyfriend like the sirloin steak. The homemade cake was to die for. Second time, the food was still excellent but we had a different server and he wasn't as good. he forgot some orders, food was a bit chilled (still good) and seemed to forget about us. Still worth going there to eat. Also, we are big fans of their house red wine."
2546,14-01-2016 ,5.0,"Trying to think what I can say as a downside to this brilliant restaurant is harder than it may seem! Short and sweet conclusion is: Food is excellent, service is excellent and, as tapas should be, the food is served as and when it's ready (which for most dishes is within minutes of ordering!) WARNING - wait time is extreme. Even turning up at six on a Sunday night we had a half hour wait! Get there as early as you can to cut this down.Recommend - the chicken & ham croquettes and the artichoke tortillas.Don't recommend - cuttlefish or chicken salad."
2547,13-01-2016 ,4.0,This is one of my favorite tapas places in Barcelona. it is near Rambla de Catalunya and the place is always packed with locals and tourists. They have good specials and the service is efficient. Try to get a seat at the bar which is more lively but dont try to go there at peak dining hours as you will queue outside.
2548,12-01-2016 ,4.0,Either go early or very late or you will be waiting for 45 minutes to an hour. Tapas was good. Eat outside if the weather is good. They had heaters going December 2015 as the weather was fabulous!
2549,12-01-2016 ,5.0,"Amazing place, amazing food! The prices are reasonable & the restaurant is well situated in the center of Barcelona.The waiter was very kind with us & we'll come back for sure! "
2550,12-01-2016 ,4.0,Top tapas bar - excellent food. Recommend booking in advance as usually quite full. Location is great - one can also sit outside 
2551,12-01-2016 ,4.0,"This is the place to be when you want to try Tapas. this bar is known by locals as well as tourists, making it often queuing. it's more than worth it. Location close to Casa Mila is excellent. Service is extremely professional. The food is impressive , exceptional product quality , portions very generous."
2552,11-01-2016 ,5.0,"Finding this place was def like some treasure hunt but so worth the walking/asking countless of passers by who were so helpful! I had the BEST calamaris and tomato bread here! The seafood was equally delicious and the desserts were marvelous! (I loved their 6 textured chocolate cake and catalana creme the best!) This place can get real packed so be prepared to wait! I loved the vibes there and the servers were all very efficient/knowledgeable! Pls do pay this place a visit, your tummies and taste buds will be greatly satisfied! "
2553,10-01-2016 ,5.0,"Get the octopus dish with sweet potato, served on a wooden dish if they have it. They also have a shrimp and garlic dish that is incredible. Always ask for the specials menu! Dessert is delicious, especially the ""homemade Catalonian style creme"". "
2554,10-01-2016 ,4.0,"We went there for a dinner. Although e were 2 families ( consisting of 7 people) and the restaurant was full, we waited less than 5 minutes, until they offered us a table.The waiter provided very good information and proposals on Tapas, so we enjoyed a lovely dinner.If you want to taste a wide variety of tasty tapas at a reasanoble price, this is the place to be."
2555,9-01-2016 ,4.0,Great place and great food. Go early or enjoy a beer waiting your table. At the mid day the rice is great and try to ask for the specilities of the day
2556,8-01-2016 ,4.0,"We ate at this restaurant twice during our stay in Barcelona. it came recommended by the hotel and was in walking distance. the first time must have been an unusually quiet time, the day after Christmas, because we went around 5:30 and there was no wait and we were sat immediately. The selection of Tapas is very large and they have daily selections that change. The first time we went I wasn't too crazy about the food, it was good but I didn't think worth the hype but I think that was poor selection on my part. The second time we stuck to the daily menu and everything was fantastic! I definitely recommend putting your name down and going for a walk on Rambla de Cataluyna to do some shopping while you wait. "
2557,8-01-2016 ,5.0,The place is always crowded since it offers really delicious food in a cool ambiance. Try to book in advace because you'll have to wait for long in the queue!!! Strongly recommend it!Tip: try their sangria- superb!!
2558,7-01-2016 ,5.0,Had to wait an hour for a table but totally worth it. We ordered about 10 different dishes. Every one of them was delicious and the value for money is outstanding! Don't miss this gem of a place! 
2559,7-01-2016 ,5.0,My workmates and I usually go there for tapas. It is not as cheap as other tapas places in Bcn but the food is just fantastic . Try the fried cheese. I recommend you to book in advance as it is usually full of people
2560,6-01-2016 ,5.0,"You'll have to wait for a place, but it's definitely worth it. Reserve a table than walk to two Gaudy's houses around and get back for delicious food. We spent 35 euros for 2 with wine. "
2561,5-01-2016 ,5.0,"This place can be intimidating to enter, as it's usually packed with customers and people waiting for a table. However, they have quite a bit of outdoor seating, and you may be surprised at how easily you get a table. Excellent tapas, especially the must try beef tenderloin. Seafood quality may not be quite as good as you'll get at La Boqueria, but prices are lower as well. You'll have a good meal here."
2562,4-01-2016 ,3.0,Went there after recommendation from the hotel and had to wait 45 min which TBH I don't mind if the quality of food would have reflected the wait but if didn't out of the 7 tapas we ordered non were anything but average. I would have at least expected a few of them to have blown my mind away given the hype of the place. I've had far better tapas outside of Spain. 
2563,4-01-2016 ,2.0,"Last time we were in Barcelona we thought this was it and a bit. Went there tonight and it was like a McDonalds take on tapas. Poor and rude service, average food and no locals. At least the price is still OK. Find other places to eat!"
2564,4-01-2016 ,1.0,"we went there around 8 pm and there was a huge waiting list. the receptionist said we have to wait for 45 mins. my wife is pregnant and during the day, people in museums and monumental areas and other restaurants were so kind to let us skip the waiting list. however, the receptionist said we have to wait anyway. so we decided not to wait and could not taste their tapas. such a shame!"
2565,3-01-2016 ,5.0,"As I was suggested by a friend who is from Madrid to try the typical breakfast Pan Tumaca, I've ordered one here.(Though this cuisine looks nothing special on photos) This is the only one Pan Tumaca I have tried in Barcelona and it is fabulous! The slice of ham is very think and it made me feel like in heaven when biting the ham. The way they mix olive oil and tomato sauce on the bread is also very balance. The taste of natural and fresh food is very obvious. Also strongly recommend tortilla patatas, it was not over-cooked, very soft and juicy!Really expect that I can go there again in my life time!"
2566,3-01-2016 ,5.0,"It is the best place we have eaten in Brc. You can not make a reservation and be prepare to wait for dinner 40 min. It is worth it. Come earlier if you get hurry. The food is just perfect, especeally for the price you pay, shrimps for 4€, calamari fried 6€, it is great price. The two of us ordered 8 tapas. It was too much, but we wanted to try so many things. Salads are very good. The service is also good. And the restaurant is very nice and modern. This place is must in Brc! Not eating here is like you have never been there! "
2567,3-01-2016 ,4.0,I am visiting Barcelona for years and tried lot of tapas bars and I am always coming back here . Even you have to wait up to 1 hour for sitting it is worth it . My favorite is breaded camembert with almond!They keep the food quality and the bar service on the high level for years.
2568,2-01-2016 ,4.0,"We knew that this is one of the best tapa restaurants in Barcelona so didn't expect to get a seat but we got lucky to get a table(actually bar chairs which was really nice). The staff are very kind and professional.All different types of seafood tapas were amazing and the price was very reasonable. Super fresh as you can see the shellfish, prawn, squid, etc. right in front of you. We had white wine as well and it tasted so good! 3:30-5:00 looks very busy so try to avoid this time or you might end up standing in a queue for a long time. But it is definitely worth the wait!"
2569,1-01-2016 ,4.0,We went on this restaurant because it was close to our hotel. Nice tapas with average rates. Sangria was not so nice but the tapas were perfect
2570,1-01-2016 ,4.0,"This was a classical tapas bar in BCN... good quality and price/quality ratio. However the plague of tourists arrived.. quality continues to be good, but waiting times can be up to 2 hours in some days, and they will evict you to free the table when they consider you're not consuming and there's someone waiting. Of course the prices went crazily up. However, I'm marking this as ""Very Good"" so tourists continue to concentrate there and don't try to find the ""Real Places""."
2571,31-12-2015 ,4.0,Tried assorted tapas. All were great!Well worth the 45 min wait in line. Do not miss this place ;..
2572,30-12-2015 ,4.0,Food here was great and somewhat imaginative tapas. There was a long wait which is alright if you're able to snag a seat at the bar!
2573,30-12-2015 ,5.0,"Had dinner here both times I've been in Barcelona. The only downside is the place is MOBBED. Tip: put your name in for a table and then hangout near the counters (which are first come, first served). Seats will likely open up very quickly. The food is delicious and relatively inexpensive. I think this was the best meal we had in Barcelona and it was also the cheapest."
2574,30-12-2015 ,3.0,"The cerveceria catalana is a nice place to try typical catalan and other spanish dishes at a reasonable price. Quality is fair enough, though it has been getting worse in the last years. You can have many different tapas, i usually share the tambor de escalivada (goat cheese with roasted pepper), chipirones (small cuttlefish), pa amb tomaquet (you definitely need to have the typical bread with tomato!!! - you'll find it everywhere though) and the crema catalana for desert (similar to crème anglaise, but not exactly the same). Best idea is to order two or three tapas for each person, and share them. Main problem with this place is that you can't make reservations, and it is always crowded, so get prepared for waiting 1h at the door if you don't get there quite early. Service is ok given that they have so many tables. Cool thing is that they have tables for up to 10ppl.I'm a local and i go there every time a foreigner friend comes to visit over ;)"
2575,30-12-2015 ,5.0,"This place was packed for dinner and it was for a good reason...awesome tapas! The line was long to get a table (30 minutes) but we lucked out with two seats at the bar and ordered six tapas, two desserts, two espressos, and a pitcher of sangria for 50 euros. We were stuffed and satisfied. This place is definitely on our list for returned visits to BCN!"
2576,29-12-2015 ,4.0,"Hailed as 'the best tapas bar in Barcelona' by some guide books, the tapas are indeed fine, the service is fast and fina, they have a few decent wines, so fine to eat here. Not per se 5 stars though."
2577,29-12-2015 ,1.0,"This is the McDonald's of tapas places in Spain. It was busy and the service was good, but the food itself left much to be desired. Felt like a definitely tourist trap."
2578,28-12-2015 ,3.0,"packed, not sure what it was that made so many people want to be there. Just does the usual snackette things and drinks. An average Barca option."
2579,27-12-2015 ,4.0,"That was very delicious we choose so many dishes that was amazing all tapas are good.And the service is amazing, we will definitely get back there Ps:don't order creme brulé it wasn't very good "
2580,27-12-2015 ,4.0,"Good place to try different type of tapas. The food came very fast. The restaurant is quite big, it can accommodate up to group of 6. "
2581,27-12-2015 ,5.0,Worth queing for! Staff very friendly and great tapas. Nit cheap but reasonably priced for the quality of the food.
2582,26-12-2015 ,5.0,"If you are new to tapas I always suggest this place, the quality is excellent and the variety as well. And you will avoid the deep fried experience of most tapas bars. In the evening you need to go at around 7pm or 11pm or you need to put your name in a list and ask how long you have to wait and in the meantime go for a walk or a drink. Is it worthed it!"
2583,26-12-2015 ,5.0,"Great food, very centric. Good local tapas with quality products and good service. If you are on a hurry, better skip it as there is always a queue. "
2584,24-12-2015 ,5.0,"If it's just the two of you the bar is the place to sit. Forget the menu just pick with your eyes or let the waiter tell you about the daily specials and personal recommendations.Expect a queue during lunch and dinner hours, but it's well worth the wait."
2585,23-12-2015 ,4.0,"Great spot for tapas, very busy spot but service is very good, fresh food and plenty of specials, just down the street from Doubletree hotel. Just off Passage Gracias"
2586,23-12-2015 ,5.0,"Wait for a table or stay on the balcony.It's a gorgeous restaurant, the tapas were wonderful, the waitress was realy kind.We order mushrooms, carcioffi, patatas bravas and bocadillos. One better than other! Just go and don't be nervous to wait for a table! Wait and will eat great food!"
2587,22-12-2015 ,4.0,"Abundance of very tasty tapas (it's really hard to pick only few of them out of the many, so be prepared to leave the place feeling reeeally heavy) and a great location. "
2588,21-12-2015 ,2.0,"The restaurant is noisy , very unpleasant atmosphere , bad service , very simple and unimpressive food. We waited some 35 minutes for a table, the waiters were impatient and unhelpful , the food was very plain, the wine was bearable , in short the best part of the meal was our departure."
2589,21-12-2015 ,5.0,"Located few blocks away from Passeig de Gracia, thought it would be a tourist trap, but I was wrongVery nice and innovative menu with lots of choices and the ingredients are fresh and the dishes are well presented, the sangria was ok not exceptional the best dish was the grilled shrimps Highly recommended for lunch or a quick bite with class .."
2590,21-12-2015 ,4.0,"We loved this very popular and fun tapas place. No reservations, so you have to wait, but we put in our names and walked around a the neighborhood a little. No problem. Very typical Barcelonan food. Tomato bread, squid, croquettes, manchego. All good, and all quickly and efficiently served. Turned out to be our favorite tapas restaurant."
2591,20-12-2015 ,5.0,We've eaten here a few times and I've never had a bad experience. Eating at the bar was great as the waiter helped us out with our choices. Probably the best food I've had in Barcelona and the atmosphere is great if you don't mind the wait for a table.
2592,20-12-2015 ,4.0,"nice bar/restaurand with small dishes served im catalan way. almost everything was noce and tasted good, but for higheat mark i would be working little bit on design of food plates"
2593,19-12-2015 ,3.0,This seems to be s very popular tapas restaurant equally amongst locals and tourists.Almost 1 hour wait (no reservations taken) to get a table.Tapas portions are large for the price. Frankly flavours were not that great. Rather bland. Pulpo and paella were good. All the rest was just average. Disappointing given the popularity it enjoys. Would not repear.
2594,19-12-2015 ,5.0,You want to eat everything with your eyes. To die for. Tried every type of tapas since we kept on going there. Great sangria too. Super friendly staff. Always busy. 
2595,18-12-2015 ,5.0,Very nice restaurant. Delicious food. Good service. Catalana Cream is favourite dessert. Staff is quick and serving with smiling face. Like it.
2596,18-12-2015 ,5.0,"Simply put...Great food, amazing variety, fast service, great price. Just faultless really!Highly recommend for lunch! We went there for 2 late lunches out of 3, and probably would've done all 3 if we would've know about it!"
2597,17-12-2015 ,5.0,Excellent food and space where you can find an amazing service and enjoy a very good meal. Every time I go to Barcelona I repeat the experience since its well deserved!
2598,17-12-2015 ,5.0,"Large and good choice of traditional and special tapas.Almost all are exceptionally good.Worth to visit, even if you need to wait long time before you get a table there."
2599,16-12-2015 ,5.0,Had a very nice tapas meal. Reasonable prices. Large selection of dishes. Bar or table service. Good choice of beers from around the world. 
2600,15-12-2015 ,4.0,"This restaurant have several kind of ""tapas"" and good service, but you need stay early or call to book, because it's famous and always have queue for table"
2601,15-12-2015 ,4.0,"Excellent place to eat tapas, highly recommend! You need to book in advance to be assured of a place to eat."
2602,15-12-2015 ,5.0,"Being from Barcelona I have tried numerous tapas places in the city. To me this is the best one. The only downside is that normally you need to wait a lot to be seated because it is so full that the normal wait is between 30 and 40 minutes. Even if you go at 11.00 pm you would probably have to wait a bit. If you are two people you can always seat in the bar, it's the fastest way to be seated. Everything single plate in the menu is worth trying, some times I have been there several days in a row but I never eat the same thing. There are a lot of things to chose from and all of it made with great quality. The price is very fair and you can have a great meal for 15 EUR per person. If you are in Barcelona, this is a mandatory stopover!"
2603,15-12-2015 ,5.0,"You can't go wrong with any dishes here and the prices are reasonable. Try to get there earlier to avoid having to wait for too long, but the turnover is pretty quick, so despite the crowd, the wait should not be too miserable."
2604,14-12-2015 ,4.0,"Excellent place to eat tapas and more, a very busy bar/restaurant, need to book to be assured of a place to eat. staff friendly and efficient. A very popular location. Price verse quality correct."
2605,12-12-2015 ,4.0,"The place is good but looking to so many outstanding eateries in Barca, one has to be way above to please tourist. The sea food tapas are good."
2606,11-12-2015 ,5.0,"Absolutely delicious tapas,highly recommend , but you have to wait for the table.We went there lunch time, very busy, but staff friendly and well organized. There are big selection of tapas,and fresh seafood ."
2607,11-12-2015 ,3.0,"This is the kind of place that has been so successful with tourists that very few locals visit anymore. The food is nice, not great. There are many better and nicer places around Barcelona to go for Tapas. It's a nice place to go for a quick snack outside the meal time window. Stay at the bar, don't go to the tables and choose either from the seafood window or from the the Montaditos window."
2608,10-12-2015 ,3.0,"I was alone so went during lunch so i wouldnt have to wait in line. As i was alone i sat on the bar, which was great as i had a full range of their food in front of me. Although friendly, the bar staff kept on shouting to other staff members sitting behind me, which wasnt so pleasent to say the least, and there was no interaction with the customers sitting in front of them. The food was hit and miss. Some of the dishes were excellent, such as the octopus, but others were a disgrace (such as fried artichoke, which basically tasted like burnt oil). Not worth another visit"
2609,10-12-2015 ,5.0,"Visited this place on a weekday , late in the evening at abt 8:30. Place was busy and they won't give u a table till all arrived. Do expect to wait for a table if u head there during peak hours but it's worth the wait. Service was not great. Staff was not friendly but we were there for the food ..."
2610,9-12-2015 ,5.0,One of the best tapas in barcelona.very good service excelent tastes .For greeks is what they need.At the moment is the place who has waiter speaking greek.
2611,8-12-2015 ,5.0,"Every time I visit barcelona I stop here for berberechos, almejas, etc. Simple, fast service that never fails. Order off the daily menu. Grab a bottle of wine and order 4 or 5 dishes for two people and enjoy a meal. "
2612,7-12-2015 ,5.0,When we arrived here there was a queue for booking a table. We had to wait 45 minutes for a table so went for a walk about and came back. It's was definitely worth the wait. The food was amazing. We ordered a few things and shared them and the staff were very good too especially with the amount of tables they had to look after. I would definitely recommend this restaurant but maybe ring ahead first.
2613,7-12-2015 ,5.0,"It's difficult to review this place when everything has been said.. But to put it simply, great service and great tapas. I would just add that if you are looking for a long lunch don't come here, you will feel a bit rushed..."
2614,7-12-2015 ,5.0,"Since the Catalana doesn't take reservations, you simply have to accept the wait. It is worth it. Arrive early in the evening and the queue won't be too bad. We waited for maybe 15 minutes at dinner time on a Saturday night. Waiting times for tables especially can be longer, but we opted to take seats at the bar/counter when offered. I recommend it. It is a great way to taste not only the food but also the atmosphere of the place. It is buzzing. The staff behind the bar are friendly, happy to make recommendations, and clearly enjoy what they are doing. The food is excellent, the baked red pepper filled with cod was an experience worth repeating. The razor clams, baby squid andaluz style and the flauta with anchovis, red pepper and eggplant are also worth mentioning. We chose the 'home made cake' and chocolate cake for sweets and were not disappointed. The chocolate cake is beautifully textured chocolate layers covered in more chocolate and the home made cake was a delicious, light slice of heaven. It is a busy place, but we have never felt rushed in any way. The staff are efficient and quick, you never wait long for your next tapa and the initial wait is more than worth it."
2615,7-12-2015 ,5.0,"Had breakfast here based on ""personal favorite"" recommendation from front desk of our hotel, the Olivia Balmes. Place was fantastic. Freshly made Spanish omelette, grilled asparagus/mushroom and a salad. The goats cheese and tomato salad was one of the best I've had. You can just taste the raw freshness of the tomatoes! The asparagus and grilled mushrooms were just ok, nice nevertheless. Two of the items were served with tomato bread which completed the meal.Coffee was good too. Works for vegetarians nicely. Just ask the waiter what's available!"
2616,6-12-2015 ,4.0,It is a very busy restaurant and we had to wait both times we ate here. The staff is efficient and gets people in and out pretty quickly. We had cava sangria and a variety of delicious Tapas plates and desserts. We liked the baguette sandwiches as well. The staff knows English and is very adept at getting orders delivered to tables. We had a much better waiter the second night. It was one of the only places open on a Sunday night so we ended up eating there again. The surrounding area is very busy with restaurants and attractive shops.
2617,6-12-2015 ,5.0,"This seems to be the place to be in Barcelona ! The food is crazy delicious and it's always crowded. The only inconvenience is the service sometimes, I've been there with my family for the whole week for three days everything was perfect but on Monday and Tuesday when there was some Asian guy serving at the terrace we didn't even bother to stay because of his incompetence and areogance. Overall when the other servers are there you'll be able to make the most of it !"
2618,6-12-2015 ,4.0,We stopped here for a pitcher of sangria and a couple tapas before a dinner reservation. We got a seat at the bar during a crowded time and had very friendly service. Everything we tried was tasty. I would highly recommend making a reservation in advance as this place was PACKED even in the off season. The patio area was heated and very cute.
2619,6-12-2015 ,5.0,"The place is bustling but service is still good, freshness of everything wonderful! We ordered the pescadito frito (sp?) and the grilled mushrooms among other things- both excellent. And the fried calamari is one of the best I've had anywhere! "
2620,5-12-2015 ,1.0,"Had a reservation for a group of friends, but once we arrived, they said they don't have a reservation for us anymore (I speak perfect Spanish and they well understood me on the phone). They asserted that I must have called a different place, showing me a card with their number. I checked on my phone and it was the exact same number that I had called, and I also recognised the voice of the woman when speaking to her. They still said that they had never spoken to me. The staff is by far the most arrogant and unfriendly staff I have ever seen in my entire life. We went elsewhere and had a great dinner down the street. Cerveceria Catalana is absolutely to void for their rudeness "
2621,5-12-2015 ,5.0,"I came to this restaurant without a reservation, so I had to wait a bit, but it was totally worth it. All of the food was delicious and the pricing was reasonable for the quality of food that I received. I would return to the restaurant for sure."
2622,3-12-2015 ,5.0,"I went to have a lunch while visiting Barcelona for three days. I asked our hotel front desk staff and they wholeheartedly gave thumbs up! Went around 12:15PM during weekdays and it was already packed. Ordered some jamon and cheeese sandwiches along with anchovies on a bun, olives, and couple of other plates. They were all exquisite in taste and freshness. I especially enjoyed the anchovies so ordered second and third plates of them. Really go down nicely with some Heineken or Spanish beers. Wait staffs were all friendly and professional. Can't wait to go back!!!"
2623,3-12-2015 ,5.0,Recommended in our book about Barcelona and for good reason it turned out! Very busy place but we managed to get a couple of seats in the bar. From there we had a good view over the different delicious tapas on display and after eating maybe six each I can easily say it was the best I've had. Best part was that depite looking rather posh it was quite cheap!!
2624,2-12-2015 ,2.0,"Maybe we put so much expectation here , after waited an hour , we asked the staff recommend so thing good , but...everything is just ok. Foods are expensive and tests not good. Services are fast."
2625,2-12-2015 ,5.0,This is a busy spot but well worth it. We walked in without a reservation but lucked into a table for eight with another group of three. The empty chair between us on both sides allowed a sense of our own group and over the course of the evening we also had a lovely and fun chat with the group of locals across the table. The food was great and plentiful. An all around great experience.
2626,2-12-2015 ,3.0,"After trying ciudad comdal and heard the owner was the same, we have decided to go there, the food was excellent, the waiting time perfect, but the service absolutely not, we had to ask several time for every order!!! dommage"
2627,1-12-2015 ,5.0,"We visited this restaurant during our short stay in Barcelona based on recommendation from locals. All served tapas were delicious, although its sometimes hard to find a free place to sit. Staff speaks (also) english anf its very helpfull.I highly recommended it."
2628,30-11-2015 ,3.0,"Went there for tapas after visiting Casa Mila. We went in around 13 and the wait was not long - around 15 minutes, but for the ones who came closer to 14 the wait was already closer to an hour.The plus was - the food and wine was very nice and quite fast, real Spanish tapasThe minus was - the horrible service. The hostess was so rude that it's hard to imagine, the line was not well-organized, the waiters were also not really welcoming. Also the items not brought were included in our bill, which is easy not to notice with tapas. I can understand, the place is busy, but it's no excuse. They're ""milking"" the tourists...What can be improved after the service is: a lot of families coming with children there and there're not really a lot of items that a kid would eat."
2629,30-11-2015 ,5.0,We went here because of all the reviews and we are glad we did. The food was awesome and the prices were perfect. We tried so many different tapas and everything was good! And finished off with the Cream Burlee thing that was the best in Barcelona lol (at least to us). Yes it was crowded and we opted to just sit at the bar because waiting for a table was too much. It worked out great because we saw all the tapas in front of us and just pointed to order. Also we saw what people around us were eating and copied! For our first time here it was perfect.
2630,30-11-2015 ,4.0,"We went on the back of all the TA reviews and were not disappointed. You cannot book but the wait is aided by being able to have a drink at the bar. Food was great, service , friendly and all good value. Would go again ."
2631,28-11-2015 ,3.0,We went here after reading some of the reviews. The place was packed. So much so that it was hard to not get jostled around. We sat at the bar and one bartender was helpful while the other was not unfriendly per se but definitely not helpful. I'm not sure if he had a bad day or what. The tapas were good but they are the same tapas that dozens of other restaurants serve in that area---so nothing unique about this restaurant.
2632,28-11-2015 ,5.0,"Everybody's said it already. Just go! It's busy, popular, delicious, atmospheric, friendly, good tapas, wine, service......"
2633,28-11-2015 ,5.0,We enjoyed this place so much we went back again. You can't really go wrong. Sangria isn't on the menu but you can just ask for it.
2634,27-11-2015 ,4.0,"Our hotel recommended this tapas restaurant, and told us to get their before 9:30 or it would be really busy. We got there at 8:30 and still had to wait about 20 minutes. But it was worth the wait. Some of the best tapas we ate in barcelona-- especially loved padrone peppers, cod filled peppers, fried artichokes... Mmm"
2635,27-11-2015 ,5.0,"We were recommended to this restaurant by a friend. Frequented by both locals and tourists, the place is busy BUT the wait is every bit worth it. Love what we had and there were so many more that other tables were having that I wished i had stomach space. What the locals ordered looked so irresistible. My photos didnt do the food any credit."
2636,26-11-2015 ,5.0,"I am often in Barcelona with guests and this place (as well as the sister Ciutat Comtal) delivers great and consistent quality, atmosphere and joy for everybody like no other place; so many tapas restaurants are only tourist traps; you can spot them easy as you can always find empty places; here, most of the time you will have to wait from 10min to one hour, but I tell you, it is worth the waiting :)"
2637,26-11-2015 ,5.0,"Now, my sister had talked and talked about this place… she had talked about how amazing it was… the atmosphere, the food, and most importantly, THE CAKE. Getting a table is difficult. You go in, give your name and size and they tell you when to come back… it was still quite a wait, but we eventually got to our seat!  The food was so good, the best tapas we had whilst we were there! The atmosphere was brilliant. Then there was this cake… the highlight of the restaurant. Despite being full, we ordered the cake. It was AMAZING. We all shared a piece, bought a piece to take back for my brother in law, and actually ate some of his too!Go to this place, enjoy the tapas, drink the wine, love the atmosphere...eat lots of the HOUSE CAKE."
2638,26-11-2015 ,5.0,"This is a must dining experience in Barcelona. You can't make a reservation online or on the phone .. you need to show up and be prepared to wait .. but waiting with a drink in your hand, waiters straggling through with tasty dishes on their way to the tables and lots and lots people all around is part of the charm of this placeYou will find many Tapas that you would like to order again and again ..Don't .. just try something new every time .. you can't go wrong and we tried plenty"
2639,25-11-2015 ,5.0,"The place is not a cheap Tapas Bar around the corner and you will have to wait a little to be seated, but it will be worth it! They have the best scampis I ever had and everything else is just excellent!!!"
2640,25-11-2015 ,4.0,"I went there with friends. They dont accept reservation. They told us to wait for 30 minutes but it took longer. After sitting on our table, everything was great. Very nice food with reasonable prices. Waiters were friendly, servlce was fast and food was great. Only thing missing was the reservation system and the time spent to sit on the table. "
2641,25-11-2015 ,4.0,"I always like to go where the locals choose to go and it looks like the locals love this place. Big tapas bar, and still you need to wait for a table. Menu with plenty of options! We enjoyed ours, but wanted to taste a lot more... Definitely a place to visit and return to..."
2642,24-11-2015 ,4.0,"A good place for having a small snack - they offer a wide range of delicious tapas. The staff was super friendly and treated us well - very happy with the service. Also the food was good, although it was a bit expensive for my taste, it was worth every cent. Really recommend this place. :)"
2643,23-11-2015 ,5.0,"My wife and I had high expectations about the restaurant having read some good reviews about it and we were not disappointed! The food was fresh and cooked just right! The staff were some of the best in the world, smart, attentive, prompt and anticipate your every need. It can get a bit crowded but having tapas at their bar while waiting for a table is highly recommended. Tray their smapler plate and their seafood tapas. The beef tenderloin steak is so good I want to go back there even just for that!"
2644,23-11-2015 ,5.0,Came here on one of my first trips to BCM 8 years ago and have been coming back ever since. This is where you go for tapas- NOT anywhere on Las Ramblas. It's busy (with locals) but the restaurant is big and the service efficient so it doesn't get wearing. The food is great and plentiful. You will leave stuffed and tipsy for EUR45.
2645,22-11-2015 ,5.0,"Food in this place is always awesome. While it can be a little busy at nights, you will notice the it is worth the time. I would recommend everything in the menu. No exceptions. A Sangria pitcher should be ordered without hesitation. "
2646,22-11-2015 ,4.0,"Always come here when in BCN, and never dissapointed.Always fresh food and delicious food.Nevertheless upon discovering the sister restaurant La Flauta, latelly i've noticed that the effort in the dishes has been going down compared to the other place. Hope this place continues providing excellent food and doesn't slack a bit behind.Otherwise a must visit definetelly."
2647,22-11-2015 ,4.0,"Ok this place is always busy, and you have to wait, but even the locals do it so we went for it. For a place inside we had to wait 45 minutes so we asked the outside staff member how the waiting was at his side......in this moment a table got free and we were seated right away.The food is great just tapas, all different kinds, a friendly staff member took al the time to explain the different Tapas.There are only two little downsides..the waiting, and the always rushing staff otherwise this would be the excellent place to dine with the locals when you are in Barcelona "
2648,22-11-2015 ,5.0,"The food was so good we ate here 3 days in a row! Huge selection of tapas and everything we tried was delicious. Definitely gets crowded because it is an excellent value, and popular with locals and tourists, so be willing to wait, or go early. Worth the wait!"
2649,22-11-2015 ,4.0,"We always come to this restaurant when visiting Barcelona, but you have to plan on waiting 40 minutes, the food us really good , i don't eat shellfish so sometimes i'm limited at tapas restaurants. We had the boquerones, pescaditos fritos (both fried Fish) delicious, the fried artichoke was good Also, the california salad. We had the dessert that is a Coco de Cabello de angel, something like that with a Wine Dipping sauce delicious, i'm def looking fwd to going there again next time. Our Waiter was unfriendly, the bus person's were very friendly And made it a good experience. "
2650,22-11-2015 ,1.0,"Never wrote a negative review before. Until now.2 friends recommended me of this place and I guess I should have known better. Cause it means a ""tourist trap"".Maybe it used to be a good place some time ago. don't know don't care. It's huge, looks very efficient and professional, but the food. My god! Ordered 5 dishes and returned 2 of them. The artichoked were almost burnt and were bitter and a baguette with jamon and cheese just dripped out so much fat it looked like the most terrible thing a person could eat.They took it away and guess what? Tried to bill us anyway. It wasn't a mistake. They actually meant us to pay and then argued.Please, DO NOT go there. Barca is full of little places, with local people. Find those."
2651,21-11-2015 ,5.0,"Visited the restaurant twice in 3 days, and that says it all. All the dishes came out very quickly, and were appealing to the eyes as for the lips. "
2652,21-11-2015 ,4.0,"Idally located for a lunch or dinner after visiting La Pedrera. Very good food, nice atmosphere and even not cheap, good value for the money"
2653,21-11-2015 ,5.0,"It has been one of the most crowded and well know. ""tapas restaurant"" in Barcelona for ages. You will find locals and tourists,..., everybody in Barcelona knows about it. Don't expect an iconic restaurant but has a great balance between service, location and product. The food is great. The service is excellent and also fast. And the decorations are modern but not in excess.Every time i visit it I enjoy the experience. Also it is an excellent value for money. Highly recommended!...I will repeat!"
2654,19-11-2015 ,5.0,"We tried three times to get into this tapas restaurant; it was extremely crowded each time. On the last night of our trip we decided to go earlier to beat the crowd but by the time we got there it was once again full to bursting. The hostess said a table should be available in 40 minutes or so and we decided to wait. We were able to get seats at the bar in half that time. Since it was pouring outside, we decided to have our entire meal at this restaurant. We had a very patient and helpful server who suggested not only the better dishes but also which we should get a full serving of and which a half serving. Everything we had was excellent. A great value, no doubt one reason why the restaurant is so popular and recommended by most guidebooks."
2655,19-11-2015 ,3.0,We went there and they told us we have to wait 40 minutes we said ok and we went for a walk. We were back after 40 minutes and 10 minutes later waiting outside because inside it was chaotic and gave us a table. In 30 minutes they served us we ate and they had already brought the bill. It was stressful. I understand that there are a lot of people waiting but eating should be a pleasure. The waiter was under stress also so it wasn't attentive he didn't t had time to explain us the menu. Any case the food is ok but really it is not Worthing the stress and the wait time. 
2656,19-11-2015 ,5.0,"Tapas was gorgeous.Just you have to wait for a long time to occupy a proper table, sometimes it takes one and half hour or more.But at this period you can take a tour through by La Rambla.Will you see it deserves."
2657,19-11-2015 ,3.0,"This is the second presumably great (according to Trip advisor rankings) Tapas Bar I've visited in BCN, and the second to left me disappointed. I guess, tapas it's not really my thing.Anyway, in terms of quality, the food is good. I only had montaditos (little slices of toasted bread with every kind of thing on top) for 1.55 the piece. It's definitely cheap, but if you wanna really fill you stomach..you need tons of those, and you end up spending big money, in the end.It's good for aperitif I guess - not for a proper, stomach-filling meal. The service was fine, be prepared to wait a bit to sit at the bar where food is served."
2658,18-11-2015 ,5.0,"Lovely place. The tapas is fabulous quality and the staff very helpful. The tab, for a very generous meal for two, including cava, was €25 a head.You have to wait for a table, but you can buy drinks and snacks from the bar while you wait. Tbh, I'd prefer that to having to book a week ahead to eat there.Tip: if you want to eat with more locals, eat late. It is, however, more crowded then."
2659,18-11-2015 ,4.0,"The place is fashionable, the service is very good and all the tapas we had were tasty, special and well presented. Quality food. Long queue, but you can leave your name and have a walk around while waiting."
2660,18-11-2015 ,3.0,Great place to drop into. Good range of Tappas and drinks as well as a good cheap pizza! Staff are very friendly
2661,17-11-2015 ,5.0,"Nice and delicious sea foods, good stafs. If u around las ramblas I offer to you have a lunch or dinner here."
2662,17-11-2015 ,4.0,"The tapas are the best thing to eat in Barcelona .This Cerveceria catalana , food wise is the top .very busy restaurant .Queue going on , no possibility to make a reservation .Just put your name on the list when you arrived .Even waiting for an hour is worthwhile and you can have some drinks waiting .You can see what you can eat and order from what you see , so no problem of language .Moneywise , food and drinks 25 , 30 euros each Bon appétit"
2663,17-11-2015 ,4.0,"This tapas place is known to be one of barcelonas greatest (from talking to the locals and tourists). They just said you can tell who's in there based on the time. Usually the locals come out at a later time (past 9pm) and the tourists are in there earlier than that. They have so many options to choose from its overwhelming. We ordered with our eyes and not our stomach, so we actually got a lot more than we could handle. The portions are not small tapas, they are actually pretty regular sized. ***side note: you can order half portions! The dishes that stuck with me the most was the octopus in a mashed potato, the long clams and the cheese pork. It was great sitting at the bar as you can get recommendations and talk to the people sitting next to you! My one complaint I have is that sometimes the food is sitting out for a bit which makes the food taste a little stale. The location is perfect as it is near passeig de Garcia the major shopping district so you can take a nice stroll afterwards."
2664,16-11-2015 ,5.0,"We went to Cerveceria Catalana on Saturday night and it was crowded. We found a place in the bar and enjoyed the variety of tapas that they had in display. We drank local beer, ate tapas and desserts and be merry. Then we returned a few days later for late lunch and we had a great time. "
2665,15-11-2015 ,1.0,"I used to live in Barcelona and have been coming back to visit every year since. Cerviceria Catalana has always been on my list of places to go despite the long queues and waits because the staff have always been friendly, the food good and prices reasonable. In fact, when they tell you that you have to wait 45 minutes, they usually call you before.However yesterday was a completely different experience. It was appalling. We were told the wait would be 1 hour 15 mins to 1 hour 30 mins and asked to come back in an hour to check. We came back and were asked to wait a little longer. We were told to wait inside. After 1 hour 30 mins of waiting we were then asked to wait outside by a very rude girl. We told her that we'd been waiting for a long time and moved around left, right and centre. She said that it wasn't her problem and could we move outside.Eventually we got a table after 1 hour and 45 minutes waiting. The very rude young Asian girl that works on the door then had the audacity to tell us that we had a maximum of 2 hours at the table! Food was as reliable as usual but the service was cold, rude and arrogant. I will not be returning to this restaurant. So many other good restaurants in Barcelona, I really don't see why people will put up with that."
2666,15-11-2015 ,2.0,"After reading so many positive reviews about this restaurant, during our three days visit in Barcelona, my husband and I decided to take dinner there. We were somehow disappointed because the restaurant is closer to the classic style fast food chains. The food although good, is served in small portions, the waiter was too hurried to give explanations or recommend something, and in the restaurant is a general clamor. I did not notice because of the noise to be some soft music, and a I honestly do not think that during a city break this restaurant worth visiting, as in Barcelona there are restaurants who make less advertising, but really worth your time."
2667,15-11-2015 ,5.0,"Really tasty food, at very reasonable pricesGreat atmosphere and worth the wait for a table Also, had the most lovely waitress (Vangie) who gave us great reccomemdstions and was lovely throughout"
2668,14-11-2015 ,5.0,Look no further! This place is awesome! Fantastically fresh tapas with a great focus on high quality seafood. Seriously delicious! 
2669,13-11-2015 ,5.0,Great foodGreat serviceGood peopleYou have to wait a bit... But it's worth it!There is a waiting list for indoor seating and one for out door seating. Make sure you go to the right person depending on your choice. 
2670,12-11-2015 ,5.0,"As good as the Ciudad Comdal restaurant (they share, we guess, the same management) but without the spatious terrace."
2671,12-11-2015 ,5.0,"I wanted somewhere to have dinner.someone gave me this recommendation and it was the best.Great tapas variety, excelent quality and flavor.Beautiful place as well, excellent location."
2672,12-11-2015 ,5.0,"Our hotel suggested this tapas bar, but said that there would be a huge line...and there was. We went on a Monday night at 8pm and there was an hour wait. Luckily, we were able to put our name on a list and then go to our hotel across the street and sit and have a drink to pass the time. We were seated at 9pm. All the tapas was very good, and the wait staff were friendly and helpful, although they didn't speak a whole lot of English. Definitely try the Spanish Omelette and the 6 texture chocolate cake. There was also a potato and egg dish that was great, and the clams and foire gras were amazing. This is a great place to eat and drink. The prices were really good, too. I would definitely eat here again. Don't be discouraged by the lines outside. the wait is well worth it!"
2673,12-11-2015 ,5.0,"Just such lovely tapas and enjoyable evening in such a busy restaurant, the only side is you HAVE to wait for a table as it is just so popular and amazing food, for us a group of 13 is so difficult for us to walk in and get a table but we can't book :( but they have a sister property called Vinitus where we can go and get the same food! :)Hope you enjoy if you do go there, i've never been disappointed and hope it carries on as they know how to make tapas so tasty!"
2674,11-11-2015 ,5.0,"Take it easy , don't go if you are in a hurry, sure need queing , but worth waiting ! Just a little bit noisy because aleays packed, but it is the only place you may encounter the real barcelona residents !!! "
2675,11-11-2015 ,3.0,Really crowded but somehow food is just average comparing to other tapas bars in barcelona. Service was nice.
2676,10-11-2015 ,4.0,We went here on a Sunday evening and it was absolutely packed so would recommend going early to reserve a spot. The food was delicious and really well priced. Staff were friendly but maybe lacked attentiveness slightly. Would definitely return here. 
2677,10-11-2015 ,5.0,"Superb Tapas - especially the Fig, Mascarpone & Iberico Ham!! Excellent Value for money and superb quality!! Went back 3 times - very busy outside - had to queue - understandably - wonderful!!"
2678,10-11-2015 ,4.0,Our tour guide suggested this restaurant for lunch and we're glad he did. We had a short wait - at around 2 pm - but once seated service was very fast. The food was very good and the price was really good! Highly recommended. They also catered nicely to English only speakers - and readers.
2679,10-11-2015 ,3.0,"Went early to avoid the lines and were shown straight to a table. Do note however this place is extremely large and doesn't at all have a traditional feel about it. We were seated, ordered drinks and given menus. We made a few selections and asked our waiter for some advice about others and were very disappointed by his lack of interest in guiding us toward a great meal. Anyway the meal proceeded, food was very fast to arrive, normal tapas size portions. We had octopus, potatoes bravas, the small squid, eggplant and goats cheese, and a white pork sausage on baguette. All were ok nothing special, and quite disappointed to find the small squid was just calamari rings and not even very good calamari - chewy and under salted. After this the service deteriorated and we had an extremely difficult time of ordering another round of drinks, in fact when we asked for another drink we were asked if we were going to order more food. Very much got the impression they were in the business of churning people through and only interested in having patrons seated if ordering more tapas. Overall a disappointing meal that did not live up to the hype, just felt like one of the masses rather than a valued customer, and the food unexceptional, wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
2680,8-11-2015 ,3.0,"We ate here after eating at a number of traditional Catalan cuisine and having been highly recommended to eat here. We didn't make a reservation so it was an hour wait on a Saturday night. It had a great bustling atmosphere, mix of locals and tourists. We looked at the menu and it was identical to a place we had eaten the night before. Needless to say, the food was nothing special and doesn't seem any more worthwhile than other places."
2681,8-11-2015 ,5.0,"The tapas were good, tasty and fresh. The service not the best but our weiter was very funny and recomended good plates. The desserts were the best!!! Good prices. "
2682,8-11-2015 ,5.0,"Came here after being told by a friend who said it was the brillint. It delivered the tapas was amazing. Loads of variety and staff very helpful in describing dishes. Tapas came and was fresh and tasty, staff were friendly and it was quick. It is very busy but atmosphere is great. "
2683,8-11-2015 ,5.0,"Like everyone else, we were originally deterred by the huge crowd that greeted us as we rounded the corner to the restaurant. We put our names down on the list and the hostess informed us that it would be around a 45 minute wait. We decided we were going to stick it out. Within ten minutes we were seated at our table and being waited on. All the tapas was very good, and the wait staff were friendly and helpful, although they didn't speak a whole lot of English. Definitely try the Spanish Omelette and the 6 texture chocolate cake. "
2684,8-11-2015 ,4.0,Ask for an English menu. Delicioso!The wait staff was friendly. Nice atmosphere. Eggs were so yummy. Waiter recommended homemade cake-- worth it! Divine! 
2685,8-11-2015 ,4.0,Variety of tapas are available ;fresh and delicious taste.However particularly dinner hours there are long que for a table or seat .Price depends on what you get.!
2686,8-11-2015 ,5.0,"Very good tapas, friendly and good service. But be aware, you have to come to he restaurant, book a time and than come back or wait for your table"
2687,8-11-2015 ,5.0,We have visited this tapas restaurant about 7 or 8 times over the last few years. It's the main reason we return with family and friends to Barcelona from Ireland. The food is incredible and it's packed as soon as it opens for lunch until closing time. You can't reserve a table but while waiting for one standing at the bar and ordering food with a drink is what the locals do and adds to the atmosphere of the place. This place has never let me down!
2688,6-11-2015 ,5.0,"This was our second trip to Barcelona and one of the first things we did was to lunch at Cerveceria Catalana. last time we were in town we ate here just about every day, and this year was not much different. This is a wonderful, crazy place serving delicious, fresh tapas.Peppers stuffed with cod. The fried whole small fish. Fried squid. Cold beer. And they had an Andalucian special, berenjenas, slices of fried crisp eggplant, with miel. We have had just about everything on the menu and could not find fault. Service is hectic and excellent, and nothing seems to be forgotten even though orders are often not written down.You can sit at a table in one of the several rooms, or just belly up to the bar/counter at the entrance and pick and individual tapas.At lunch there is usually a line, but it moves quickly. Just go in and walk up to the reception desk. Don't wait for anyone to greet you.I miss this place...."
2689,6-11-2015 ,4.0,Visited this restaurant on 01/11/15 and have to say the food was excellent! Such a large variety of food and a completely different dining experience. The prawns especially were delicious! We did have around a half an hour wait so if you do come here definitely don't expect to get a table straight away and make sure you try the sangria for a large jug at only €15 such a great deal and so nice! :)
2690,6-11-2015 ,4.0,"Very good quality tapas, excellent service but really busy, you need to book a table in advance but it's definitely worth it! We will be back! "
2691,5-11-2015 ,5.0,We went on Saturday evening so it was packed but after waiting for 1 hour we were able to get a table which was definietely worth. Tapas are very fresh and diverse and the prices are very cheap for what they are. I would love to go back even though it is hard to get in!
2692,5-11-2015 ,5.0,There is a reason why this place is always so busy; the food is delicious and service great. It may take you 10 mins or so to get a table but the wait is worth it. The food is very authentic and ingredients very fresh and the staff are very attentive. Highly recommend! 
2693,4-11-2015 ,5.0,"Glad a friend recommended we visit here, food was great. We were advised 1hr15m wait but they called for us only 45mins in. We were seated between other tables with chatty people and it was a very social setting.When we arrived we realised this must be the sister restaurant to the place we at the night before (Cuidad Comtal). No problem, ate some of the same things and tried plenty more others. Daily specials were different so had plenty of choose from.The place was very busy but that also meant there was a good energy and the food came out pretty quickly. We shared everything so had no issue with the order of what came out. There were several cod-fish dishes which were excellent. The prawns also were great.The bill for two hungry people with drinks was around 70 Euro which was great value for the quality of the food.Would definitely come back."
2694,4-11-2015 ,4.0,This place is super well known by tourists. So expected it to be very crowded. Go at about 7pm. You are likely to be able to get a proper table. It's the same menu as the pintxo bar but it's much more comfortable to sit at a proper table. Coz at the pintxo bar it's is crowded with the people queuing. 
2695,4-11-2015 ,5.0,"Great choice for Tapas, huge selection of good quality Tapas in this very popular restaurant, mouth watering food display along the bar, we were lucky to get a table late afternoon without a wait."
2696,3-11-2015 ,5.0,One of the best places in Barcelona to have really fresh and tasty tapas. I visit every time I go to Barcelona and I never get disappointed. Trully a must visit.
2697,2-11-2015 ,5.0,"45 min to get a table from 6 pm to 2 am, Monday to Monday, this is as good it is....an it was still only April not even warm yet. Wonderful seafood, baby squid, perfect draft. Could go on and on...but it is a need to see experience....."
2698,2-11-2015 ,5.0,"Every kind of tapas is so unbelievably delicious and you even can taste out the freshness of seafood and vegetables. Not only the menu, checking out the food bar is also nice before you make order. If you need any help, don't be hesitate to ask the staff. They are friendly and willing to translate the menu and recommend dishes for customers as well!"
2699,2-11-2015 ,5.0,We have been here twice in a week eating different foods- they have a menu of the day that changes- for two people 34 euros with coffee and bottle of wine- a good variety 
2700,1-11-2015 ,4.0,"Delicious Tapas - made fresh to order blended with outstanding service, makes this place a must-go! Make sure you round off a delicious meal with dessert - there are some yummy delights to choose from!This place is very crowded - the wait can be about an hour between the 7:00 to 9:00 PM hour. So you can either avoid this slot or put in your name and saunter around the nearby Passeig de Gracia for an hour. It is worth the wait!"
2701,1-11-2015 ,5.0,"I would have said Tapas is my least favourite food so I wasn't expecting to eat tapas on my trip to Barcelona.However, we went here on the recommendation of our concierge and cab driver and were not disappointed. Many of the reviews said we should expect to wait as the restaurant is so busy so we went prepared. However, on seeing my two children aged 7 and 9 and mum aged 78, they immediately made up a table seating 3 to 5 to accommodate us which we weren't expecting.All the dishes were amazing leaving us wishing that we had ordered another of each but they were perfectly portioned and extremely tasty.The service was efficient and friendly and we would definitely recommend it."
2702,1-11-2015 ,3.0,"This place is nice to go to every now and then but it definitely has too much of a hype. The food is okay, the service is in general often very quick but it feels more like they are quick to seat one more sitting at your table. Price quality relation is good which is why I have gone more than once."
2703,1-11-2015 ,5.0,It's worth waiting for the best tapas you can find! Even it can take more than half an hour you really have to eat in this restaurant if you visit Barcelona.
2704,1-11-2015 ,1.0,"I ate here with my brother for a late lunch on Friday, the food was delicious and the service great, but both of us spent the entire night throwing up and the next day recovering in bed. Apart from some bananas for breakfast, this was all we ate! We lost a whole day of our trip. Worst of all, when we went back to the restaurant to let them know, they were extremely rude to us and said the company would only speak to us if we had a doctor's note to prove our illness, didn't even ask which dishes we'd ordered to see if there'd been a problem."
2705,31-10-2015 ,5.0,"This is worth waiting in line for! Bustling busy fun atmosphere. Fresh amazing tapas. The regular menu is available in English however the daily specials were only in Spanish. Thankfully our servers were happy to translate the specials both times we went. The selection of tapas is large, all types, fish, vegetables, cheeses, egg, potatoes, meats, it just keeps going. We had the best tiny fried sardines and white marinated anchovies. We can't wait to return someday. "
2706,31-10-2015 ,3.0,"Very busy Tapas restaurant if you are prepared to wait. The staff appear to always be in too much of a hurry, questions asked are not always answered, at least on our visit. The mixed seafood platter should be avoided, recommendations are geared towards the top end of the price chain, although not that expensive but also not that tasty.Perhaps we caught it on the wrong day and time but it was a big disappointment, and as such cannot highly recommend."
2707,30-10-2015 ,4.0,"There was a long wait to get in but the food was worth it. GREAT tapas and very god service. The food came a little too quickly but it was fabulous. I would order a couple of plates at a time to avoid that problem. Located right off of Los Rambles it is very convenient. We put our name on the list, left and then came back."
2708,30-10-2015 ,5.0,"So good. Arrive early or be prepared for a long wait. There's seating available both inside and out. Just can't get enough pulpo á la gallega! Wish I had photos to share, but I ate my plates too quickly. "
2709,30-10-2015 ,5.0,"Four of us were recommended to go to Cerveceria Catalana one afternoon. We had to wait about 20 mins for an outdoor table. Restaurant was very busy. Lots of locals and tourists. The menu did not have any English but the waitress was very helpful translating and recommending dishes. The food was delicious and the four of us all enjoyed our tapas and our Spanish cervesa, Estrella which is a nice lager."
2710,28-10-2015 ,4.0,"It is a very known restaurant that is announced in magazines of other countries. Its customers are inhabitants of the five continents. This restaurant doesn't book in advance, so you have to remain from half to an hour in the cue."
2711,28-10-2015 ,5.0,"As a tourist you might think that tapas are nice anywhere you go in Spain.... But that is not the case... Unfortunately there are many bars and restaurants tourist orientated that offer tapas that don't have antthing to do with real tapas.I am from Barcelona and I can say this is a great place to enjoy very good quality tapas. Having said that, there are also some cons:- it's not posssible to book, therfore one has to queue. Waiting time is very long, because the place has become very popular among tourist...- It's too crowdy, especially with noisy tourist"
2712,28-10-2015 ,4.0,"This October was our third time over a span of 10 years that we have stopped in Barcelona and eaten at the Cerveceria Catalana. The previous times were an exceptional food experience. The last time was 2012 with our daughter and her family. Then the waiting line was out the door and on to the side walk. An hour to an hour and a half wait was not unusually, we were lucky and got in after 45 minutes. The food then was fabulous, the tapas were varied and wonderfully tasteful. Each new order of tapas was better that the last one. Over the last five years the Cerveceria Catalana wait times have not changed, however, the quality and the fabulous favors are no longer what they were. At our visit we were dinning after a long day of travel, so we thought the issue was with our being tired, so returned two nights later. Unfortunately, the tapas were still lacking in that favor and enjoyment that we remembered.Next time we visit Barcelona we plan on looking for another tapas restaurant. It was great once upon a time, now not so much."
2713,28-10-2015 ,4.0,We went here once for dinner. Got there early and succeeded in getting the last table on the terrace by the street. I've had better patatas bravas elsewhere but in total this was a nice experience. I would definitely recommend this place after a shopping spree since it is located right by the two biggest shopping streets in Barcelona.
2714,27-10-2015 ,4.0,"We waited over an hour (which was expected) and it was very good. We tried a variety of tapas and the waiter actually took my husband over to the tapas bar so the waiter could point out suggestions and my husband could point to what we wanted. Lively, loud atmosphere. It was very crowded with tourists but seemed like a local favorite too."
2715,26-10-2015 ,5.0,"We love our food, and really loved this. Figs to die for. Seafood fresh. Great atmosphere. Plenty of locals - always a plus. Just as good the second visit 3 days later, and still loads of things still to try. Superb value. If I could live in Gracia and dine there once a week, I would be very happy."
2716,26-10-2015 ,5.0,"We decided to give this place a try after walking by it several times on the way to and from our hotel which was two blocks away. There were always lines waiting to be seated.We stopped in around 7:30 pm and got our name on the list. We only waited about 10 minutes before being seated. It was certainly worth the wait! We enjoyed our early meal of mixed salads and tortillas. We shared a lemon mousse for dessert. Service was excellent and attentive. The interior decor and lighting is very modern and tasteful. Overall, a very good experience."
2717,26-10-2015 ,4.0,"We went to Cerveseria Catalania with a local friend. The place was packed and we had to wait. The wait could be a bit long and the place is full of people. It is hard to find a place in the bar even for a drink.However, once seated, the service and the food is really good. All the tapas we had were very good. They offer the traditional tapas and also the tapas of the day/week, which could be a very nice discovery. For its very good taste and price, we recommend it very much."
2718,26-10-2015 ,5.0,Outside or inside is equal great.The best tapas in Barcelona.Try everything.Drink TIO PEPE .A bit pricy but worth it.Be polite and you will get a spot to eat.
2719,26-10-2015 ,5.0,"We finally were able to get into Catalana on the third try. We tried in April, 2015 and then again in October for dinner. Going at night expect waits of 20 minutes to more than an hour. We decided after two night time attempts to go for lunch. The wait was ten minutes. We had been told and now agree this is some of the best tapas in Spain. The staff is mainly Asian who speak good English which is very important since embarassingly our Spanish is weak. All I can say if you go you won't be disappointed in the food, the atmosphere or the service."
2720,26-10-2015 ,4.0,great place to spend a night out with friends or family. Overcrowded but tranquil.Food is excellent and the price we paid was quite well.
2721,26-10-2015 ,5.0,"With limited time in a city with so many fabulous options, it says a lot that we chose to go back to this fantastic spot. The first visit, we sat at the bar mid-afternoon. Enjoyed a cold beer and tapas sampler. The second visit, we had dinner with friends, letting the server choose the tapas selection - well worth it! Reasonably priced for the quality as well."
2722,25-10-2015 ,4.0,"Having just left, this restaurant was recommended to me by a ex work colleague who visits Barcelona often. The food is pretty good, although there is a lot of fish choice and not being a fish fan I found the choice limited. I would recommend though. "
2723,25-10-2015 ,4.0,"I've been there several times and it's worth it to wait for getting a table. They serve typical catalan tapas such as pan con tomate, patatas bravas, huevos revueltos, octopus, calamari,etc. All if them are well made and tasty. Price is good but the restaurant is usually full and you have to wait a bit for the table. "
2724,24-10-2015 ,5.0,We stumbled on this place while looking for breakfast on our first morning in Barcelona. It was full but a waiter managed to find a place for us at the bar. The food was Fantastic. So was the service. We tried going back there for dinner but gave up as the queue was very long. I am sure it would have been worth the wait had we time to wait. Excellent food and service at a reasonable price. Highly recommended. If you have time to queue. 
2725,24-10-2015 ,5.0,We covered 1500 miles including 7 cities and this stands out as the most fantastic meal we've enjoyed. Don't miss this but be prepared to wait during normal eating times. The line outside is for outside seating so don't despair. Go inside and try to sit at the bar where you can point at the dishes you want. One person took pictures of dishes before going to his table so he could show wait staff his selections. 
2726,23-10-2015 ,5.0,"I ordered off the fresh sheet and was not disappointed. I started with a calamari, mushroom, asparagus plate which was delicious followed by gambas roja a la plancha, and a boccadito of gambas, calamari all washed down with a tall bottle of Duval. The service was speedy and the price was right. This a on my reliable Barcelona meal list."
2727,22-10-2015 ,5.0,"There is always a line waiting to eat at this restaurant. Living in Barcelona I resisted to eat there because most of the people you see are tourists. My cousin came from France and asked me to take her there. Great experience. We had to wait, but it was worth. Food is great and service was fast and friendly. I´ll repeat."
2728,21-10-2015 ,5.0,"Everything is freshly made...our favorites were the Gambas rojas a la plancha (Grilled garlic shrimps), all on the montaditos caliente list and the Sangria is so refreshing! There is always a crowd but we managed to get seated right away in the couple of times we visited. Friendly, accommodating and efficient staff...really Highly recommended!"
2729,21-10-2015 ,5.0,"My girlfriends and I went here and loved it. We had to wait about an hour for a table, and the place was very crowded. We were just excited to be in Barcelona, and did not mind the crowd. We were able to easily order sangria at the bar while we waited. We shared a bunch of tapas, and we had a very helpful waiter who worked with us even though our Spanish is not the best. I would definitely recommend this if you are staying nearby and want a trendy but delicious meal out. The prices were also very reasonable."
2730,21-10-2015 ,5.0,Had some great business lunches there with various dishes and always good catalan wine !B.elneedo.com
2731,21-10-2015 ,5.0,I try to eat here every time I am in Barcelona. The food is soo good and the ambiance is awesome! Definitely a recommendation!
2732,21-10-2015 ,3.0,"It's in all the guide books so expect a queue, but of course there queue is for a good reason. The food is good and not too expensive. Although the menu is almost identical in Ciudad Condal which is a lot bigger so no need to queue."
2733,21-10-2015 ,4.0,A big choice of tapas with a lot based on sea food. Excellent choice after walking and shopping in Barcelona centre. The service could be better. Many waiters but they are many times lost. 
2734,20-10-2015 ,5.0,"We had lunch at the Cerveceria. Just a few dishes with a couple of beers. The place was crowded, but we ordered and got our tapas in no time. Very friendly staff, despite the rush. The tapas were very tasty and we highly recommend this restaurant and we will return."
2735,20-10-2015 ,5.0,"This was the best tapas meal I had during my visit to Spain. The food was simply delicious. It was simply so good, my friend and I could not stop eating. This was such a treat not only for the eyes but the palate. You must have one meal here!!!"
2736,20-10-2015 ,5.0,One of the best places to enjoy tapas. The selection of tapas is very broad and you should be able to enjoy very simple and sophisticated tapas of every taste. The broad selection makes it very enjoyable to share amongst groups.
2737,20-10-2015 ,5.0,"I've been here many times in Barcelona. The restaurant is very well located in the center of Barcelona, close to la Rambla. The staff is very friendly and the try to serve you very quickly when is possible. I would say to avoid Thursdays , Fridays and Saturdays night, 1 hour queue for sure. The food is excellent, you can choose a lot of tapas with sea food, steaks, mushrooms and a lot of yummy things. They also have typical fried sea food, a lot of beers and quite cheap and good quality."
2738,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"I have visited Barcelona 5 times in the past few years and every time I have been to this restaurant at least once and never been disappointed! They serve all of the typical dishes with a few extras, my favourite being the ""huevos cabrellos"" a kind of egg and chips dish with bravas sauce - delicious!! All at reasonable prices and the service is also great with staff always keen to recommend dishes. Also it's always full of locals which I think is always a good sign too! You can't book so be prepared to wait for a table pretty much any time you visit. Lunch time is better, but in the evening the wait is about 30-60 mins, which is fine as there are plenty of places to go to grab a gintonic while you wait! "
2739,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"Absolutely amazing tapas. The waiter was a hoot telling my husband to sit and be quiet as the Senora (that's me) will choose tapas for him. Great wines and fabulous desserts (if you have space). Friendly, informal place. Go there is you are in Barcelona."
2740,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"The atmosphere is trendy and inviting. The tapas amazing, but be prepared to wait an hour to get inside. My suggestions is to put your name in, and then go to one of the close by sidewalk cafes and have a drink while you wait. "
2741,19-10-2015 ,1.0,"This was a genuinely dreadful meal. I can still taste it now and left over an hour ago.Service was poor. We were charged for food we didn't order.We had calamari which tasted like it been left out for a week and then cooked in a microwave.The rice dish was very greasy.The tomato bread was stale and didn't taste of tomato.In short, this was shockingly bad food and if you are in Barcelona then I seriously encourage you not to go!"
2742,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"I was staying separately from friends, so when a taxi came for me, it was after 8pm. The place was packed but vibe was energizing. We had to wait at the bar before we could get a table but they serve you there as well so it isn't a chore to wait. All wine seems to be delicious so don't worry. We ordered a number of tapas & not a bad one in the bunch! Try the Iberian ham & we had 2 rounds of squid. The mushroom plate was also fabulous. If you go, do so before 8pm or be prepared to wait. I don't think you can reserve. I echo what others have said. Not to be missed. First class experience!!"
2743,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"On our first day in Barcelona we asked the doorman at our hotel to recommend a nearby place for lunch. He gave us a few names but said the best was Catalana. We are so glad we took his advice! We were able to get an outdoor table, a menu in English, and quick and friendly service. My husband ordered the tuna, anchovy, roasted pepper and olive sandwiches which he loved. I ordered the Jamon (ham) sandwich which was also delicious. The local white wine was really good too. We would have eaten here all four days, but on a couple of return visits the wait was too long. This is a very popular place in Barcelona. However we did manage to eat here one more time. We ate inside the restaurant as the outdoor tables were taken. This time we ordered a few tapas. They were the best that we had in all of Spain."
2744,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"At least in my opinion , if you are looking for tapas. Superb taste of tapas , fast service and great atmosphere.The plase is very busy , so be prepared that wait time might be up to 45 minutes - but it is worth it.Probably you will not get better tapas anywhere else in Barcelona wheer price/quality/taste is that good. "
2745,19-10-2015 ,5.0,"During our trip, this was the first restaurant we went to for dinner. We loved it so much, on our last day in the city, we went back again. None of the other ones we tried in the city were as good, affordable and enjoyable as Catalana was.On both of our visits, there was a wait, but what amazed me was that whatever amount of time they told us to wait, it turned out to be exaclty on the dot. The first wait was 30min, we just went to a store nearby and by the time we were done, we were seated. The second wait was an hour late, but knowing how much we enjoyed the place, we decided to wait. Because our hotel was nearby, we just waited there (stores were all closed).Their menu is in Spanish, but they always had a server who was there to recommend (and up sell) their dishes. Overall, their dishes were all above average and their service is really fast (specifically on their most popular dishes).If you have the time, it is worth the wait."
2746,18-10-2015 ,5.0,"I went there at around 6pm for dinner and did not have to wait, was immediately seated. I am told by others that this place can get quite crowded and a long wait. The food is great and was reasonably priced, would definitely go again."
2747,18-10-2015 ,5.0,"They all looked so good you'll want to try many but the skinny sandwiches with tuna, anchovies, red peppers and green olives were wonderful."
2748,18-10-2015 ,5.0,"It is always stimulating to visit a restaurant that is very busy and doing well.Service, seating, everything here is quick and to the point, although at some moment you should be prepared to wait. I had a. o. nice fried fish, excellent delicious squid and good house wine, in spite of the name cerveceria. I wish there were more restaurants like this in the world. Be careful: portions are relatively large. I made the mistake of ordering 4 plates at once, and answering "" yes"" to the waiters question if I would like to have some bread as well. Some bread was 8 pieces of baguette with tomato and garlic. Nice, but something of a muchness. Greediness was immediately punished, although in a pleasant way. Highly recommended."
2749,18-10-2015 ,5.0,"Must reserve as demand is super high, any tourists try to book around midday to avoid late lunch rush. Service was faster than any other place I visited. Sat down, ordered and eaten within 45 mins! The food was exquisitely tasty and well presented, the veil was cooked to perfection. Staff were very accepting of the lack of spanish speakers and menus were presented in english as well as spanish. Pricing was competitive and I will be returning next time I'm in the area."
2750,18-10-2015 ,5.0,"I love love love this restaurant! Went back twice. The tapas are to die for. We ordered steak with foie gras, clams, skewered shrimps that seem to pop in your mouth , salmon & a whole lot more. Must try place in Barcelona. Note that it is not cheap though so be prepared. Plus the place is always full even on weekdays but the wait is worth it."
2751,18-10-2015 ,5.0,This place is always busy! My friend and I got lucky getting a table right away because it was just the two of us. The service is quick here with multiple waiters catering to each table. The seafood tapas was delicious!
2752,17-10-2015 ,5.0,"Unbelievable how good this place is. I had such great food and unbelievable good service, restaurant winner in my book."
2753,17-10-2015 ,4.0,We couldn't find it the first time. We were driven away by the long one hour wait and our impatient stomach the second time. We went again the third time but with a prepared tummy and after one full hour of meditation to keep the cool.By almost 10pm we are seated and we decided we should go as late as we can. Service is less passionate compares to Tapas 24 but the food is fresh and tasty! The portion is right and we wish we could have more time. The clams are great and the veggies are well prepared! Be sure to ask for whatever is fresh for the day!
2754,16-10-2015 ,5.0,"Without question, this place is one of the best of the best in Barcelona. I can't stress enough how amazing the food is at this place and what makes the visit much more enjoyable is the great service you get when visiting! Keep in mind, this place gets packed during dinner time and it's extremely popular so be aware of long lines and wait if you arrive at ""peak hours"" but the wait is worth it. When in Barcelona this is one of the places I don't miss and it's my usual ""lunch spot"" never ending great food, sangria and tapas to nibble on! If you are wanting to eat lunch here it's recommended as the foot traffic for lunch is normally on he slower side compared to dinner. This is a place that you definitely shouldn't miss! One of my favorites. "
2755,16-10-2015 ,5.0,"Delicious, varied tapas, great service! Worth the wait in the queue. This place really stands head and shoulders over similar tapas bars. "
2756,16-10-2015 ,5.0,"Ate here last night on the recommendation of a friend, coupled with good trip advisor reviews. Can only agree with all the positive comments. This is a really busy, buzzy place with a lovely atmosphere. The tapas are really good and the staff are extremely professional , good humoured and patient. Thoroughly recommend a trip here to anyone looking for tapas in Barcelona, get there early and you won't wait too long for a seat."
2757,16-10-2015 ,5.0,"Visited Barcelona twice (June and August) Heard about this place since it is a 'cousin' of Cuidad Condal. Great tapas, so many choices. you sit and watch everyone else get deliveries and then know what YOU want to order. Very varied and always fresh and tasty. YOU CAN""T GO WRONG! Lively crowd and is a larger place than first meets the eye. Don't miss it!"
2758,16-10-2015 ,5.0,"11 of us arrived just before 7 pm( had intended to go at 6 pm as recommended but time got away on us) and advised of a 1hr 15 min wait so as we were staying around the corner, we registered and then went back to our apartment. Perfect solution. Seated promptly after arriving at the given time. I had read about the signs on the wall advising you to watch your belongings. I hung my hand bag on the back of my chair but it was in the middle of the table by the wall so nigh on impossible to take it unless you squeezed in behind me and somehow avoided being seen by all at the table. However, the waiter promptly mentioned this was not a good idea and to move it. Having read about this before, I asked him where he suggested I put it. He was dumbstruck...had no idea where I should put it but just not on the back of the chair. I thought maybe they could have a safe out the back and lock everyones belongings in it whilst dining, seeing as though they had so much concern. Not a biggie but absolutely unnecessary.However our dining experience was superb. We ordered a huge range of tapas...the special eggs and chips, calamari, croquettes, mushrooms and asparagus, small burgers, hot dogs, jamon, prawns, tuna, eel, camembert grilled and more. All of it was fresh and tasty and delicious. Waits weren't long for food to come as we reordered. We enjoyed it all with a few beers. We didn't have any 'sweets' because we had thoroughly enjoyed the tapas.It was also reasonably priced. I would go here again and again if I lived in Barcelona."
2759,15-10-2015 ,5.0,"Went there for lunch and had the Mix Plate which was very good, delicious fried camembert and patatas bravas (tasty, but had better in other places). Service was good and food came fast. Nice experience!"
2760,15-10-2015 ,5.0,"Our cab driver, coming into our hotel, recommended this place before we even checked it out. Arrived early (before 8PM) and still had to wait in line to give our name, and then for a table, Well worth it! We had 6 tapas plates, a bottle of wine, and the 'homemade cake' for dessert; all spectacular. Busy, vibrant spot. Great first night highlight."
2761,15-10-2015 ,4.0,"Good place, large, but gets very busy at 7 pm. Come at 6:30 or so. What to order? Just look at other guest's plates and ask if they really liked it : )"
2762,15-10-2015 ,4.0,"It is crowded, but it is worth it. Cheap and quality food! Slow seating but fast serving. Because of all the people it is a lot of noise, but that's Spain. "
2763,14-10-2015 ,5.0,Great place for tapas. Starting from the olives to the croquettas to the camembert with jam. Another great dish is the Cabresos egg style. Also tapas of the day are great
2764,14-10-2015 ,4.0,"We had eaten here before and it still had the same buzz and great food. Get there early and you won't have to wait long to get in,at times you can wait at least an hour! Great choice of tapas and larger plates, and is served quickly, staff helpful with explanations and recommendations, worth the wait, we went back the next night as well!"
2765,14-10-2015 ,3.0,"We made it here at the second time of asking (tried the previous night at 9pm and couldnt even get in the door). We arrived early (7pm) and were seated pretty promptly, most of those after us waited a long time. Service was very brisque, so food came quickly, but the advice from the waiter was minimal and they tried to upsell a lot. The food was good, no complaints. Nice tapas, well presented and a wide range of seafood,. As soon as a plate or glass was nearly done it was whisked away which upset one of the other diners so much he complained. Overall as long as you realise it's popular and the turnover will be quick youll be satisfied, but don't plan a leisurely romantic dinner."
2766,14-10-2015 ,5.0,"Very delicious local food at acceptable prices and good service level. They have two menus - introductive and additional, we started with the first and were full so didn't try the second. The waiters themselves offer to start with it and decide to add anything from another menu or not. You need to make reservation or need to wait there for at least 20-30 minutes as it is crowded at lunch and dinner times. Must try is crab salad. "
2767,13-10-2015 ,5.0,"We walked in for lunch after visiting all of the Gaudi sites, and we were seated right away. The tapas were all excellent, none of them disappointed. Service was attentive and friendly, even though we asked a million questions and took forever to order. If you're in the area, definitely try it out!"
2768,13-10-2015 ,4.0,"Arrived in Barcelona mid-day and headed over to Cerveceria Catlana for lunch. Highly recommend sitting outdoors, but the inside seating was also nice. Great tapas including an extensive cold seafood selection. Had the tortilla, octopus, ham and cheese sandwiches, and even the mini burger was good. "
2769,13-10-2015 ,5.0,"We stumbled across this restaurant whilst walking into the centre from our hotel. The thing that attracted us was the amount of people swarming around the front, this is usually a good sign! We had to queue up to get a table inside, the queue was around 10 minutes to get to the valet. She put our names on the list and told us to come back in 30 minutes. This was around 7.30 pm. That was fine, we went to a bar nearby and had a beer. When we came back at around 8.00 pm the queue was even longer. We were shown our table and had quick professional service. This is a true tapas restaurant, we ordered multiple dishes. The highlights were the calamari, beef fillet, stuffed zucchini flower, the prawns on a skewer and a delicious potato dish with egg and spicy sauce. We also had a bottle of white wine. The pricing was very reasonable for such a meal and a bottle of wine, it came to 60 Euros with a tip. Highly recommended!"
2770,12-10-2015 ,4.0,"Friendly staff. Tapas were good and fresh. We didn't have reservations but they accepted walk in.Walking distance from Casa Batló, Great neighborhood."
2771,12-10-2015 ,3.0,"We ate here once (Sunday afternoon) whilst on a recent short break to Barcelona, after reading the many excellent Tripadvisor reviews and since it was close to our hotel. Upon entering, we stood at the bay/cash register, which seemed like where one might be shown to a table. We were ignored by a few members of staff, before being lead to a table. The tapas menu was reasonably basic. However, the food that we ordered all came quickly and was quite good (although nothing that special). We ate in some much better/friendlier places during the rest of our stay."
2772,12-10-2015 ,4.0,"We learned about Cerveceria Catalunya through Tripadvisor and highly recommend! We went twice: dinner and lunch on different days and both were worh it. Be ready for a wait for dinner, about an hour for inside/two outside. We were lucky there bar had openings before our table. The good part about seating at the bar is you can see the tapas, a visual feast. Order Estrella beers, which is the local brand and really good! Lunch was a little less crowded and we were seated inside. Make sure to ask for the daily specials, really worthwhile and come out faster than some other menu items!"
2773,12-10-2015 ,5.0,Great food. Fresh and alive. Met some beautiful people whilst dining. Went 3 days In a row. Experts now! Recommended by our Hotel Actual another gem of Barcelona.
2774,11-10-2015 ,5.0,"Always busy... of course, and that is why the food is always fresh and delicious. The Tapas they serve defies any gastronomical experience you have encountered in this lifetime. You have to wait for great food and when it's time you just don't want to leave. In the end, you have to leave as your conscience reminds you of all the persons waiting outside in line to come in. You are assigned a Server but given the busy atmosphere, there are 3 others available to tend your table. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."
2775,10-10-2015 ,5.0,"An amazing tapas bar. The food is fresh all the time.Very wide menu and tapas.The staff are professional and the service is very good.Need to come very early or very late , because it crowded , and you cant order a reservation in advance, but only when you there. "
2776,10-10-2015 ,5.0,"Little nice place, great tapas and very tasty food.Prices are more than reasonable. Service a bit slow but worthwhile waiting ( waiter a bit funny and don't remember everything but leave you with a smile )"
2777,10-10-2015 ,2.0,"We visited this restaurant on a Saturday during August. It was busy with a long wait for the lunch. We got our name on the waiting list for a table outside and were told to check back in 40mn (or 90mn can't remember). We took a walk around the neighbourhood and sat in café until it was time. When we arrived it took only a couple of minutes to get our table ready.The weather was pleasant and it was packed inside, so sitting outside was the logical thing. However it was too noisy and a bit dusty with the car traffic behind us.The restaurant design looked trendy with a good mix of locals and tourists.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The menu was basic and items were not detailed, so we didn't know what to order, even though at the bar inside there was a wide variety of salads and meat (so we didn't know which is which). The restaurant was full and waiters had no time to sit down and explain what each plate is exactly (and what each dish contained, as some of us had mild allergies and wanted to avoid certain food).We ended up ordering tapas, and tapas arrived quickly (one after the other, as soon as they were ready):- the grilled mushrooms: tasted like regular fried mushrooms- a greek salad: tasted average, if not less- potatoes bravas: normal potatoes, nothing special- grilled fish (cuttlefish?): was dressed with a huge layer of mayo or ali i oli that overtook the taste of the fish (even though it was grilled to perfection, it was a bit cold).- grilled sirloin: probably the tastiest item we ordered."
2778,9-10-2015 ,5.0,"I have passed this place few times while staying 2 blocks away and was discouraged by huge lines and tons of tourists, joking that someone must have written good things on trip advisor. I finally went in one night and discovered that getting a place by the bar is not that difficult and that food is truly amazing. Cava and sangria is only sold in half liter minimum and as in many other places, you choose your food. Good option if you are coming solo since you can order piece by piece. While crowds can be discouraging it is worth while to go in and enjoy."
2779,9-10-2015 ,5.0,"My boyfriend and I ate here for lunch after it being recommended to us by our B&B. We were lucky enough to sit outside in the sunshine and enjoy some delicious tapas. We ordered 5 dishes and a bottle of wine. The staff were very helpful when we asked about the dishes individually and reassured us that we could stay as long as we liked and order more dishes as we pleased. We were amazed when we received the bill to see it was only 34 euros! There's a lovely atmosphere outside, watching the world go by! Well worth a visit. "
2780,9-10-2015 ,5.0,"Lovely dinner here in Barcelona. Quality tapas, but not overly fried or heavy, with wonderful drinks and decor. Gets crowded, but worth it. FYI we took young toddlers and the readily supplied high chairs. Good mix of locals and out of towners."
2781,9-10-2015 ,5.0,Very well known and widely recommended cerveceria. This means two things: very fresh ingredients and high quality food AND a long wait for a table. At 8pm expect to wait 45 min. At 9pm it could be 90 min or more. The food and the service are very good. Enjoy!
2782,8-10-2015 ,5.0,It really is a nice looking restaurant but its hard to get into. We got there at 10:30 pm and the place was so packed and the waiting list so long we left. My advise call early for a reservation. From the looks of the place and the amount of people trying to get in it should be worth it.
2783,8-10-2015 ,5.0,Try the razor clams. They are considered trash fish and eel bait here but they were absolutely delicious. Family friendly but small children may not like the food. Young adult (Teen) and adult dining when I was there.
2784,7-10-2015 ,4.0,"This was a great tapas restaurant with really great food - especially the seafood. We got there around 9pm and were told the waiting queue was 1.20 minutes for a table. However, if you loiter around the bar area and watch for any imminent leavers then you can grab a bar seat which is what we did. "
2785,6-10-2015 ,5.0,"The tapas here are absolutely delicious! We had been in Barcelona for 4 days and eaten A LOT of Tapas and this place was the best. We had to wait 20mins for a table at 2pm on a Tuesday, but it was worth it. The service was good, the prices were good, the food was fantastic! We also squashed in the 6 textured chocolate cake at the end and... omg! Amazeballs!"
2786,6-10-2015 ,4.0,"Our hotel recommended Cerveceria Catalana, they said it was where the locals went to eat, so we were really looking forward to an authentic tapas experience. And it was... to a certain extent! The food was certainly excellent, lots of variety, including my favourite huevos rotos (Spanish egg & chips in spicy tomato sauce)... Yummie! The downside was the amount of time spent queuing to get in! There was a line outside about x15 strong with a majority of tourists & very few locals. We got chatting to various nationalities whilst waiting outside, so it wasn't all bad as we shared holiday stories & tips for what to see & do in Barca, etc, and it WAS worth the wait for such excellent tapas once we made it to our table. It's clearly a very popular place to eat, but I'm not sure I'd visit again unless we could just walk in & enjoy a more authentic experience."
2787,6-10-2015 ,4.0,"Summary:A very busy and lively restaurant serving decent tapas located very close to two major tourist attractions: Casa Batllo and La Pedrera. Getting there:It's about a 5 minute walk from Diagonal Metro. A little bit closer if walking from La Pedrera. Do use your GPS (if you have one) to make sure you're walking in the right direction. Barcelona-WiFi is also free to use around that area. Arrival:It's going to be very busy so when you arrive make sure you go up to the front of house to put your name and number of people down. I had to wait 20 minutes for my seats but it was worth the wait. Restaurant: It is quite a big restaurant and there's plenty of seating indoors and a few outdoor tables too. It generally has a comfortable feel to it even though it was very busy. Service:The service was great. The staff is English speaking, polite and attentive: they were quick to clean our used up plates and give us new ones ready for our next dish. Our waitress also politely reminded us that we may have ordered too much for two people, which turns out they were right. Food: Not knowing exactly what to choose we went for the mixed tapas, which consisted of grilled prawns, peppers, clams, squid rings, potato croquettes and clams; and I felt it was good value for money. It's certainly one of the best tapas I have ate in Barcelona. The good:Food and staffThe bad: Extremely busy (but then again that's because it's a good restaurant!)"
2788,6-10-2015 ,5.0,"Our first stop for tapas in Barcelona. Recommended by our hotel concierge (H10 Art Gallery, a great place to stay) and also #1 by our Barcelona/Vancouver connection.No reservations, be prepared to wait, but the wait is worth it. Most fun sitting at the bar - you get to watch all the action."
2789,5-10-2015 ,5.0,On a quiet Sunday afternoon this place was thriving. Great tapas and great prices. Can't wait to go back to try more from a huge selection.
2790,5-10-2015 ,5.0,The great thing about tapas is there is always room for just one more. When it is this good it is hard to stop. The food was great. The menu was in Spanish so didn't know what everything was. Great fun to see what would turn up - was all good anyway.Was recommended by a friend so would like to pass on the recommendation - definitely going again next time I'm in Barcelona!!
2791,5-10-2015 ,5.0,"Busy (prepare to wait!), very tasty restaurant. Super fast service – although it sometimes gives the feeling of a fast food place. We liked it, but if you want a wine and candles place…Great special Tapas."
2792,5-10-2015 ,4.0,Good tapas and a fun local vibe. This lovely tapas bar sits slightly on a side road off of the famous Las Ramblas strada. Great seafood tapas on one side and all other tapas along the main bar. Great vino by the glass and wonderful local ambiance. All things good for a lovely affordable price!
2793,4-10-2015 ,5.0,I found this spot on Trip Advisor and was glad I did. The tapas were excellent and the wine was good. This place is packed so make sure to go early either after Spanish lunch time or before dinner hours. Good mix of both locals and tourists.Try to get a table outside and enjoy the atmosphere. My bill came to approximately 40.00 Euros for two people.
2794,4-10-2015 ,5.0,"During a trip at Barcelona, wife and I visited around 5 tapa places, and we agreed this is the best one out of all of them. The place is always busy, which plays a part in the atmosphere. There are 3 ways to get a seat: (1) put down name to sit inside, (2) put down name to sit outside, (3) or just wait beside the bar seats until someone leaves. Tip: to minimize your waiting time, put down your name for both inside and outside (around 45 mins to 1.5 hours). While waiting for your name to be called, wait for a bar seat. We manage to get a bar seat within 10 mins. You can enjoy your tapa at the bar as well. Switch to the table when your name gets called. For us, we preferred to eat at the bar and forfeited our table. You get served almost immediately since you are right in front of the food. You get to see the food too so you can just point and choose. Busy places tends to have bad services, but this is not the case for this place at all. Highly recommended for a great dinner."
2795,4-10-2015 ,5.0,"Best tapas we had in Barcelona, and the place and the people visiting are great fun. Mixture of locals and tourists and very busy . It is not possible to book a table, you have to show up, and then hang around or go somewhere else and have a glass of wine while waiting until they have a table ready for you."
2796,4-10-2015 ,4.0,"If you want to sample the delights of CC at regular meal times for Spain (that's to say 2PM for lunch and 9PM for dinner) then you are going to need to be VERY patient. Despite its large capacity (it has a counter for food served a la plancha, a counter for cold tapas and lots of tables - some al fresco) the no reservation policy of CC means that there is always a huge crowd of forlorn would be patrons milling about outside the doors. If you want to try and avoid long queues, I would advise an early bird tactic. Try to get there for lunch at midday, or dinner from 6PM. You'll probably have to wait still, but it will be way less than the 90 minute wait we had for a table at dinner.Right, that's enough about tactics; what about the food? Well you probably guessed that there wouldn't be quite so much demand for this place were the food not very good indeed. You'd be right. CC serves incredible tapas. The place is open all hours and the turnover is huge, so the food is always very fresh and tasty.It's my belief that the prime location here as just on the left as you enter. This small counter with about 8 to 10 seats is where the warm food is prepared. The prepared dishes sit behind glass waiting to be chosen and cooked. Wonderful gambas (prawns), almejas (clams), mini hamburgers, and the quite magnificent solemio which is a tender slice of veal fillet, cooked to perfection and served atop a slice of baguette held in place by a pimiento del padron on a toothpick. Most of the staff speak English (and many other languages too), and remain cheerful and efficient amidst the bedlam in which they work. It's true that the queuing is a little depressing, but once you've eaten here, you will want to come back. Just be a little bit smart about timings, and a splendid time is guaranteed for all.Tapas aficionados might want to seek out Tapeo in the Ribera close to the Picasso museum, and also El Quim in the Boqueria market just off Las Ramblas."
2797,3-10-2015 ,1.0,Shocked to have such terrible food after viewing all the positive reviews on TA. Food was under seasoned and tasted like it had been frozen and reheated in a microwave. Shrimp were cold and gummy. Wine was overpriced and tasted as if it was one month away from turning into vinegar. Restaurant is huge and signage was posted everywhere as to be careful with your belongings. Only place we saw these kinds of signs in all of Barcelona. Felt more like a food factory instead of a restaurant. Disappointed that we wasted our time and money here for our last dinner in Barcelona.
2798,2-10-2015 ,5.0,"At the recommendation of the doorman at our hotel, we went here for dinner our first night in Barcelona. It was very busy, but we only waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait. They serve a great selection of tapas. We had ham, mushrooms, asparagus, cheese, shrimp, etc. - everything fresh and deliciously prepared. The sangria with Prosecco was great - so refreshing on a warm evening and not too sweet. We enjoyed Cerveceria Catalana so much, we returned for a second visit before we left."
2799,1-10-2015 ,5.0,"An oldie but a goldie. Touristy? Yes, but embrace it...there are as many locals without fannypacks, sandals & white socks combos and rain macs as there touristas (you know who you are!) with the aforementioned attire. I think it looks well for the revamp in the last few years.Embrace the crowds and the wait (it's never as long as it seems)... Even better, I say stay round the bar area ... Always interesting, fun people there!Sollo millo (mini filet) and the broken eggs fries are the must-tries!Great atmosphere, great value!This place is a BCN classic."
2800,1-10-2015 ,5.0,"We lucked out and scored a sidewalk table right away. There was a long line before we left to get any table, inside or out. They have a great wine list and we enjoyed a bottle of a fine Reserva Rioja along with several tapas, including the fried baby calamari and white anchovies in vinegar"
2801,1-10-2015 ,4.0,"A friend recommended this place to me and warned me that it gets very busy. True to her word, it was already packed when I got there, and I waited 20 minutes for a table for two.The restaurant is big, with both outdoor and indoor seating (you can even sit at the bar and eat), but even still it was full to the brim!The staff were very helpful and as soon as your plate was empty they would come and take it away for you. When choosing what to eat, the waiter kindly advised that we'd ordered too much, so we cut back on a few dishes to begin with.I chose the mixed tapas (16 euros) which consisted of grilled prawns, peppers, clams, squid rings, potato croquettes and clams, a fried potato dish and also a prawn skewer. It was really good value for money, and it must have been nice because we ate it all and then continued to place an order for the mussels! The only negative that I have is that the sea salt that was added to the prawn skewer and mussels was a little too much for me (I prefer to have it as it is and enjoy the natural flavours alone).We weren't rushed to leave, we ate at our own pace and left when we were ready to go.A very pleasant meal, great lively buzzing atmosphere and altogether we spent about 37 euros."
2802,1-10-2015 ,5.0,Very busy high quality tapas bar with a wide choice of tapas and good service. Nice atmosphere and not too expensive. Get there early evening or be prepared to wait for a table. Definitely the best choice in the area. The serves are large compared say to tapas normally served free with drinks in Andalucia.
2803,1-10-2015 ,5.0,Everything was just perfect except the queue. We had to wat almost one hour outside or maybe more. It was luch time and very crowded. The food is really yummy. They offer very good tapas. The variety and the taste is just amazing. The diversity of the customers is also interesting.
2804,30-09-2015 ,3.0,"We have been visiting Cerveceria Catalana for 10 years for lunch, dinner and late night bites!It is always busy and filled to the brim with tourists...and of course there is a massive queue. It can get a big aggressive so not necessarily a great experience if not timed right. The food can be really good, but expect a hefty bill!Love the prawn brochetta, montadito de salmon, y solomillo de ternera.... and certain tapas del dia.Service is hit or miss...Wish it was a more relaxed experience!"
2805,30-09-2015 ,4.0,"This was our first tapas experience for lunch! We got here around 1:30-2pm, and it was very crowded. We just walked in and sat at the bar where they serve you right away. We didn't speak Spanish, but luckily one waiter helped us out. We ate quite a bit, but at the end it was a bit pricey for lunch."
2806,29-09-2015 ,5.0,A tourist hub ... But also lots of locals... Prices are reasonable ...very busy they don t take reservations .. We went twin first time Saturday night 1 hour and half wait.. But your in Spain you leave your name and you go for a walk... Great food great service awesome ambiance 
2807,29-09-2015 ,5.0,"Great service and food. Reasonable prices too. Squid was amazing, calamari very fresh. No reservation, the wait was not long."
2808,29-09-2015 ,5.0,Wow - great atmosphere - wonderful food - be prepared to wait but its worth it .. and sit at the stool by the food...so tempting to just eat and eat ... !!!
2809,29-09-2015 ,5.0,"How do you choose a tapas restaurant in Barcelona? This one offers indoor as well as outdoor seating and wonderful tapas. Sangria was also delicious. Busy every evening, but it opens early if you don't want to wait."
2810,29-09-2015 ,5.0,"I have been to this restaurant more than a few times and have never been disappointed. There is always a wait but it is so worth it. If you prepare ahead of time and know what to expect, it helps. The food is so delicious! I have brought friends and family there too many times to count. The tapas are yummy and you can order a drink while you wait and drink it outside too! Highly recommended!!!"
2811,29-09-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent food and good service. I highly recommend to order several tapas and share, you would want to try them all!"
2812,28-09-2015 ,4.0,"We ate in a different resturant the night before, and the menus were almost identical... The good part was that unlike the other resturant, in Cerveceria Catalana we didn't have to wait for 45 minutes just to get a table. The food was nice though."
2813,28-09-2015 ,5.0,Fabulous tapas. Best we've ever had in Barcelona. Well worth waiting for a table if it's busy. Great value too.
2814,28-09-2015 ,5.0,"The best tapas, they do not take telephone reservations, so one has to wait from 30 - 90 minutes but it is worth, very nice wines, tapas and helpful and efficient service, reasonable price for the exceptional quality and sites of portions"
2815,28-09-2015 ,5.0,"if you want the best foodie experience in Barcelona this is it! We have been to this place before when in Barcelona and we were determined to go back this time and take friends. We sat at our favourite part which is the front bar area, and let the theatre of the place take over. The food is so fresh, the dishes change daily with the availability, the seafood is sublime. The price is more than reasonable and I just want to go back NOW!"
2816,28-09-2015 ,4.0,"Very good food, reasonably priced. Service was good, but nothing extraordinary. Was recommended to us by several locals."
2817,27-09-2015 ,4.0,"This is an extremely bussy tapas restaurant visited by locals and tourists alike. The food is really good, and prices are fair. There is likely to be a queue at the door, and the service seems a bit bussy/industrialized. All in all a nice experience, but there are other restaurants in Barcelona with equally good food and better service/ambience."
2818,27-09-2015 ,5.0,This place is very very tasty but the only bad part is that it is so well known and it is always crowded but when you talk about spain and tapas this is what a truly amazing tapas joint is like. 
2819,27-09-2015 ,4.0,"I really liked the tapas in this place. It seems to be always very crowded, but it may worth a visit. Tapas plates are not huge and it may be a bit expensive, but the quality is very good. I can recommend it."
2820,27-09-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent tapas. Big variety. There is a one hour waiting for a table, but it absolutely worth it. Fair price."
2821,26-09-2015 ,5.0,"Ate there twice. Place was buzzing even at 4 in the afternoon. Attentive efficient staff. Excellent tapas. Friendly waiters (who were happy to help in English) didn't oversell and made really good recommendations - for example, battered aubergine with sweet sauce. Sangria really good and other drinks very reasonable. Food is authentic and honest. All those customers filling the place weren't wrong. No hesitation in recommending."
2822,26-09-2015 ,4.0,"This ""cerveceria"" has many (both meat and seafood) delicious and good quality tapas. Also the service was excellent and the prices were reasonable."
2823,25-09-2015 ,5.0,"Having eaten here about four years ago on company business, I kept telling my wife I would take her if we went for a holiday. This I have now done and she loved it that much we ate there again the next night! You have to accept you will have a wait..even if you turn up at 10.30pm, there will be a wait and it is so worth waiting for! Once you get there make sure you find the person looking after the waiting list, a rostrum 3 metres or so inside the main door, then relax with a drink while you take in the vibrant feel of the place. Enjoy!"
2824,24-09-2015 ,5.0,"we got there after a long day, the waiter was a little unpacient but the food and the sangeria were really good so it was wearth it."
2825,23-09-2015 ,5.0,Absolutelty amazing experience. Beautiful restaurant in heart of Barcelona with friendly staff. They even spoke French and English as my husband Spanish is not as good as he likes us to believe. Wonderful mix of classic and innovative cooking presented with care. Did drink a Pinot Noir though to keep it a little French. Lol. If you visit Barcelona go here 
2826,23-09-2015 ,2.0,"May be my choice was wrong but the food was not tasty at all. We have ordered an beef steak, mushrooms and assortment of sea food, that was just terrible."
2827,23-09-2015 ,4.0,"Great tapas, and good service, but be sure you get here early – this place has a line around the block by 8 o'clock. We especially liked the mini calamari, which was the best my wife had ever eaten! All the food is very well-prepared, and they have an extensive wine list, as well as craft beers. And with food, as well as two half bottles of wine, our total bill was €30 – if I lived here, I'd come here every night! A very popular place with the locals!"
2828,23-09-2015 ,5.0,Try every single tapas. You won't regret! Here is the best place to spoil yourself if you are a food lover.
2829,23-09-2015 ,4.0,"A group of eight of us arrived here to find it absolutely packed. One of the guys managed to secure us a large round table towards the back and it worked really well for us. The waitress was very helpful and spoke English. We had a selection of various tapas, such as anchovies, prawns, asparagus, stuffed eggplant with cheese on top, tiny bread sticks with tomato purée, and of course the wonderful Spanish ham! We shared a couple of bottles of Rioja red wine. In all the atmosphere was buzzing and the food good. Would recommend."
2830,23-09-2015 ,3.0,"I was there many times for dinner. The service is poor. The food is average. I have no ideea why people love so much this place, is just a normal restaurant. nothing special."
2831,22-09-2015 ,4.0,"Nice restaurant on the corner of Rambla de Catalunya and Calle De Mallorca. The food and the service was very good and it is open until 1:30 after midnight. I went there wit a group of 25 people and everyone loved the food, especially the tapas."
2832,22-09-2015 ,1.0,"1) It was no coincidence that all the Asians are brought to the seats in the back of the restaurants, and you can only see Caucasians in the front/terrace seats. I don't know their intention, but that's how I and my fellow felt. Would not recommended for non-caucasians.2) I'm not sure if it was necessary for the waiter to slam the plates down without saying anything when they served food.3) Ciudad Condal's food was much better."
2833,21-09-2015 ,4.0,"Great selection of tapas, sumptuous flavours in seafood and Mediterranean style dishes, all consumed in an outdoor sidewalk setting with excellent personal service. Even those in our party who did not start out wanting seafood, came back for seconds and thirds. A very busy place with healthy line ups as an indicator of quality...but not too busy to accommodate a group of six within 15 minutes.A great way to end the day on the streets of Barcelona."
2834,21-09-2015 ,5.0,We went here on a recommendation and everything we had was very good. I especially loved the shrimps on a skewer. We ate outside which was delightful. The sangria was excellent. Not too sweet and more wine than others I have tasted.
2835,21-09-2015 ,3.0,I have visited CC before and had amazing tapas. This visit was quite disapointing. The service was bad and the food very average. Of all the tapas places we visited on this vacation it was the worst. Not sure if we caught them on a bad day or what but it definitely was not what i remembered or competitive with other tapas options in Barcelona.
2836,20-09-2015 ,5.0,"Very good food and very good value for money as well. The mini hamburgers are Perfect!!!!! the mini stake as well, went there twice on my visit"
2837,20-09-2015 ,5.0,food is excellent typical spanish food with good serviceto be recommended i certainly would go back
2838,20-09-2015 ,4.0,"We were recommended to visit this restaurant by hotel staff, not disappointed , you can't book so just turn up and wait on a table , we were told 30 minutes but only waited 10 :-).... Busy place but food was delicious , great selection of tapas and extremely good value for money , our meal for 4 which consisted of about 12.tapas plus drinks was 60 euros, great value for money."
2839,19-09-2015 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by our tour guide. The food quality is outstanding and reasonably priced, which explains the large number of people waiting. It's not a small place, but we got there around 7pm on a Monday and wound up waiting a bit over an hour for a table. Check your bill carefully. We had an extra item on our bill we didn't order, and we overheard several others around our table with the same problem. "
2840,19-09-2015 ,4.0,"This was recommended by the front desk personnel in our hotel & the place didn't disappoint. The tapas were delicious & filling, esp the skewered gambas & fish ball. Not to forget the ""house cake"" , yummy"
2841,19-09-2015 ,5.0,"Recommended by hotel and had previously researched as a possible dinner option. The tapas, sangria and service great. Arrived around 6:15 pm two days in a row and seated immediately. Arriving later will require a wait but definitely worth it. Will vReturn if we visit Barcelona again. Yummmmiiiii."
2842,19-09-2015 ,2.0,"There are many waitress in this restaurant but most of them are sulky. The food tasted so-so, even the expensive clamshell also just so-so. The interior is good and the queue is long. "
2843,19-09-2015 ,5.0,"This was one of our favorite restaurants in Barcelona....They do not take reservations so we did as other reviewers suggested and went around 7. We were seated immediately and loved every single tapa they brought us. I wish we could have gone back to sit at the counter/bar to enjoy another meal as it was that good. I highly recommend this restaurant and listening to the waiters suggestions. Also, take your time....they will bring the dishes out fast....slow down and enjoy the food!"
2844,18-09-2015 ,5.0,Recommended by a local. Big queue to get a table. We waited an hour to get a table but it was well worth the wait. The food is delicious and very well priced. It's a must eat when in barca!! Just remember to book first.
2845,18-09-2015 ,5.0,"Although we had to wait half an hour for a table (no booking), we chatted to some people already eating at the bar. Get yourself a drink while you wait.Food to die for + service very prompt. Great fun. Great evening."
2846,17-09-2015 ,4.0,"As the reviews say, this place is crowded and expect a wait. The tapas were tasty, interesting and fresh, and we enjoyed the drinks, as well. The service was good, considering the crowd and worth the wait. I would definitely recommend this classic Barcelona stop."
2847,17-09-2015 ,5.0,"Amazing tapas amazing sangria. But you can wait up to 1 hour for a table. If you are patient, it will worth it for sure. 5 / 5!"
2848,17-09-2015 ,5.0,"The food is spectacular! The service is average, because the waiters have an insane workload with the busy crowds. They work very efficiently though! You will love the food, and it is worth the 1 hour wait! "
2849,16-09-2015 ,4.0,"This is one of the most classic catalan classic tapas restaurant. they´re serving all day, but there´s no reservation so i might be hard sometimes to get a table. The food is always fresh and good. This is the place to go when you have friend or family who want to discover good local products and gastronomy but no surprise..."
2850,16-09-2015 ,5.0,"Our first attempt to go to Catalana would have been a 40m wait. Heading back at around 5ish on a Monday instead of prime-time lunch Saturday, landed us a table immediately. We shared the prawns, pork sandwich, grilled mushrooms and razor clams which were all very tasty and well cooked. Excellent sangria too "
2851,16-09-2015 ,5.0,"This a tip from a friend and at 1st the service was not what I expected, but after all it was very pleasant. I think Brazilians expect more of services than any other nationality. Everything we ordered was on time and delicious."
2852,15-09-2015 ,5.0,"Recommended by staff at Double Tree down the street, there was a line of course so had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table. If you not sure what to order just look around at other tables or at the bar and you'll get a sense of what's popular. The tappas were the best we had in Barcelona, so definitely hit this place up."
2853,15-09-2015 ,3.0,"We were recommended Cerveceria Catalana but a few friends who had been to Barcelona before. We arrived after what we thought would be the lunch rush to find a long queue which is always good. It wasn't clear who was in the queue and who was just loitering inside so that could and should be improved on. It seems there is a separate process for sitting outside which no-one mentioned. After about 25 minutes, we were seated at a table but walking through the restaurant, we saw plenty of empty tables. It seems the hosts wanted to keep things slow to create the illusion of business outside. We ordered our food from what felt like an impatient server and before we had a chance to drink our drinks, food started to come out. Not the end of the world and certainly better than slow service but within about 4 minutes, all our dishes had been served and we felt rushed and under pressure to leave and finish. Good food overall and maybe one to go to at non-peak times but the next day we tried La Flauta and had a much more pleasant experience there."
2854,15-09-2015 ,3.0,"Food is good if you want consistent quality/service but not a memorable food experience if you're a foodie. Perhaps we didn't order the right things but it seemed similar to most other ""GREAT"" tapas places - good variety.VERY touristy and don't need to speak a word of Spanish to get by if that's your thing.If your here for a few days and have had tapas a few times maybe try somewhere else. We will continue our search for better."
2855,14-09-2015 ,4.0,"Pros: Amazing selection & all cooked incredibly well.Elegant ambiance. Toddler friendlyLovely, friendly, & efficient waitstaff Cons:Potential wait timeSlightly pricier than expected but completely reasonable for the experience/location.I'm personally not a huge fan of tapas but my husband is & we all enjoyed this place including our toddler in- laws (who prefer Asian food & are tougher to please with other cuisines).Initially, we were told there was to be an hour wait for our party of 7 at about 7:30pm on a Saturday night, but miraculously they seated us right away! Recommended dishes:Anchovies CalamariRed peppers stuffed with codTapas appetizer sampler "
2856,14-09-2015 ,4.0,"We ate here after reading positive Tripadvisor reviews. Further, the reviews stated to get there early, which we did (around 7:45pm) and didn't have to wait. The tapas were great, the service was good for Barcelona, and the atmosphere on their patio was nice.. although the cars driving by were a bit noisy. The thing I liked best was that all of the tapas looked great in terms of presentation and tasted just a good. We enjoyed our night at this tapas bar and would recommend it to anyone looking for good food for reasonable prices in Barcelona."
2857,14-09-2015 ,5.0,"Was staying at a nearby hotel and chose this nearby café for breakfast each morning as the hotel breakfast was over-priced for the food available.Was delighted we did - delicious baguettes or Spanish omelettes and superb value.Service is brisk and you may struggle to get servers attention but the food is excellent.We had breakfast here on 3 mornings and never had to queue, securing a street table for our party of 3 without a wait on any morning"
2858,14-09-2015 ,4.0,"We stopped in for tapas and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and ice cold beer. The patio scene was hopping, and there was music in the square, which I understand there often is. Great place to enjoy a lovely Barcelona night. The staff seemed happy to see us, despite an overflowing patio."
2859,14-09-2015 ,5.0,Everybody dream about tapes when going to Spain. All restaurants claims they have tappas! But - the dream only comes true when going to Cerveceria Catalana! An amazing presentation - and same amazing quality! Bon Profit!
2860,14-09-2015 ,4.0,I was for a weekend in BCN with friends and the restaurant was suggested by a local connection we have. Excellent. We really enjoed local flavours of tapas.
2861,14-09-2015 ,5.0,"We had a nice tapas selection here our last day in Barcelona after the cruise. Avocado salad, seafood salad, several small sandwiches, fried anchovies, all done well, and a good value. Four of us ate very well for less than 50 Euros. Only thing missing was paella, but it was only because they did not serve until noon, and we had to leave"
2862,14-09-2015 ,5.0,"Back for dinner again, we have been to this place more than 10 times now, Still i have not received one dish not cooked to my satisfaction. If you ahve problem with noice then dont go here but for the rest of you, its amazing, the food is so good and the wine is great, dont miss out on their sangria, suer yummu. It must be one of the places in the world where you get the most of your money. The service is great as well:)"
2863,13-09-2015 ,4.0,"I was recommended to go there and I did. The food is very good, but being always crowded you have to wait in line quite so log to get a table. Also the staff seamed that doesn't matter how they behaved because they have costumers anyway."
2864,13-09-2015 ,5.0,"This is a great Tapas bar. Although you may have to wait an hour for a table (it is so busy and there are always queues), the service is quick and the food is very freshly cooked. We have a selection of tapas and all were either very good or excellent. The front of the restaurant which is the tapas bar is quite a sight and worth visiting just to have a look. The atmosphere is great. We always go back to this bar when we visit Barcelona."
2865,13-09-2015 ,5.0,"They keep having good, fresh tapas, as I've been here many times now. Eg Small steak on bread, superb! Attentive waiter/bar tender who gave the little extra touch with his humor. We sat at the bar since the line to get a table was 30 min's (at 7pm!). So, be prepared to wait...I'll be here again when I'm around, for sure"
2866,12-09-2015 ,5.0,We were here mid week end of August and it was very busy- we managed to get one seat at the bar and eventually 2 of the 3 of us were seated. The service was great and made great suggestions. The Sangria was wonderful and the whiskey cake is highly recommended :)
2867,12-09-2015 ,5.0,"I recommend you to seat at the tapas bar and start ordering food. In Barcelona all the tapas are a bit expensive, but this one is worth it. For 2 persons you'll end up paying around 35€-45€.I would visit this place again!"
2868,12-09-2015 ,5.0,"If you want Tapas, this restaurant is not to be missed. Quite a large restaurant but it still had a great atmosphere and vibe. Expect to queue for a table if you don't dine early, but defo worth the wait. Huge selection of Tapas, helpful waiters who will explain the food. Served quickly, hot and delicious. Portion size was great and good value. Try the six texture chocolate cake. Yum."
2869,12-09-2015 ,5.0,"This was our third time in this beautiful restaurant and we can only say it continues to blow us away!! We are very used to the high demand associated with this spot and the natural waiting time associated with nabbing a table and usually we love this as we get to soak up the atmosphere over a glass of Cava ( or two)... However different circumstances on this occasion- being pregnant influenced the Cava - or lack thereof as well as the tolerance for standing. The front of house was fantastic, quick to oblige with a table for 2 and was so discreet!! The menu is extensive and the waiting staff are friendly and good humoured! The value for money is second to none and this remains our favourite Nosh spot in Barcelona! You won't be disappointed!!!"
2870,11-09-2015 ,4.0,"This is truly a great place for tapas although you must be patient cause it is not quick to get a table. They told us we had to wait 1h but luckily instead within 30 min we had a table. Must see ... Lots of tourists so not sure how does it go down with locals. But their freshly cooked tapas sea amazing, the little shrimps especially "
2871,11-09-2015 ,5.0,best food we had in Barcelona. they have variety of seafoods and tapas. all are great. Do come early. avoid dinner time as it will be packed. we went on 10pm and have to wait for 1 and half hours so we change our mind and go the next day morning. the food are great and delicious. we went there twice for a 3 days trip.
2872,10-09-2015 ,5.0,"This place is great, during our stay in Barcelona my partner and I ended up visiting this place three times because it was just so great. The tapas is low priced but tastes great just order a bunch of a menu and dive in as they come, by the end of the meal you will shocked at how little all that food actually cost you."
2873,10-09-2015 ,4.0,We sat at the bar and had our tapas made promptly in front of us. Really great variety of fresh seafood. Our waiter was very attentive. Bit of a trek (on foot) in the heat from Plaça Catalunya but worth it!
2874,10-09-2015 ,5.0,The best choice in Barcelona if you are looking for tapas and you are not in a hurry.You always will wait almost an hour but it deserve
2875,10-09-2015 ,5.0,"When in Spain you have to go to the bars and have tapas. This is one of the best spots to do that in Barcelona. Jabugo pata negra is a must at every tapas restaurant and my favoritehere is a fig with cream cheese toped with jabugo ham, amazing !!! "
2876,10-09-2015 ,3.0,"Very, very, busy. It had nice enough food, but the staff were clearly rushed off their feet. My daughter and I both thought we saw one of the waiters pass a mobile phone to a man who did not appear to be a customer, who did not make eye contact with him and who then immediately left the restaurant. We didn't see where the phone came from, so couldn't complain. It may have been innocent, but it was odd enough to unsettle us. Go by all means, it is clearly popular, and the food was ok, but do watch your things."
2877,9-09-2015 ,5.0,"I went with some friends and we just ordered a bunch of tapas, and kept ordering more. They were so good! The chicken salad was pretty bad but the salmon on a small slice of bread was actually amazing! "
2878,9-09-2015 ,2.0,"Went here after a taxi driver recommended this as authentic catalana food. Came in and first impression was good. Had to wait for a table around 30 minutes which was ok. It is very bright light in the restaurant, not very cosy. We understood that this was because of the turnover of tables - they didn't want people to sit for too long. Food was ok - nothing spectacular. This is a tapas factory - no soul. We wanted to go to a local, authentic catalan restaurant, but this was not it. and The service was nothing more than average. Would choose a different option next time."
2879,9-09-2015 ,2.0,The place has been renewed few years ago with a more modern and essential style. It's always crowded of mostly tourists. Main defect is the scarce quality of the food and the high prices compared to other places in Barcelona.Once you are there it seems a cool nice place where to eat & drink. Very good for non-gourmands looking for an unoriginal barcelona food experience.
2880,9-09-2015 ,4.0,"I am pretty sure this restaurant is owned by the same group as Ciudad Condal. Ciudad Condal is still our favorite, this restaurant was even busier as for some reason there are even more tourists which is a bit strange as its a bit further from the o centre So will not repeat soon"
2881,9-09-2015 ,4.0,"A GREAT place, fantastic food, good atmosphere, pleasant service ... Very few minuses :) ... The waiting time exceptional long - and one little flaw with a hair on the plate :( "
2882,9-09-2015 ,5.0,"La cerveceria Catalana is a must if you come to barcelona. The food really good, there are many options to order and the price is more than reasonable. There is one only problem, they dont make reservations and there is an average 1h waiting list, thegood thing is that they have place to have a drink while waiting.The most recomended tapas in my opinion are: Montadito de langostinosMontadito de solomilloPimientos verdesTortilla de patatas Calçots (its a type of onion)Alcachofas fritas ... I could continue but its good to take a chance, they wil suprise you. "
2883,9-09-2015 ,2.0,"We went to Cerveceria based on numerous reviews touting it as a classic and ""must visit"" tapas joint in Barcelona. We were expecting a wait, but by some miracle we were seated almost immediately despite there being plenty of people waiting before us. Probably had a lucky number of people to fit the seating options.The atmosphere in the restaurant was pretty nonexistent, a little rushed and down to business (not in a good way) just like the people working there. We ordered a variety of dishes based on own favourites and recommendations from our waiter. The food arrived quickly and was okay, if rather boring and uninspired. The meal turned out pretty cheap (it ""helps"" that we were not enjoying ourselves enough to order a second drink), so there is that -but when you're in Barcelona you can do a lot better than bland food for an okay price. Drop in to any tapasjoint around and you'll have a decent shot at having a better meal than this."
2884,9-09-2015 ,3.0,"A classic place well located. Safe value, a bit expensive. Betterto walk in back street to find better alternative."
2885,8-09-2015 ,5.0,"Always a good bet, but not for the faint of heart. You have to stake your spot out and as soon as someone leaves, you have to belly up to the bar. Great tapas and beer. A tourist favorite, but there's lots of locals as well. "
2886,8-09-2015 ,4.0,"Got in on our second try. Went at 9pm on the first day and waiting time was 1.5 hours. Came back the second day at 6pm and got a table right away. One of the best tapas places. We had 2 rounds of the grilled razor clams, the mini hamburgers, jamon, grilled prawns, calamari and some egg with potato dish. Washed it down with a bottle of cava and local beer. Service was unsmiling but prompt... similar to what you get at a busy Chinese dimsum restaurant. Highly recommended for the food and ambience..but come at an off peak hour like 6pm."
2887,7-09-2015 ,4.0,"We knew from previous reviews that we would have to wait for a table. Monday night and at 9.15 it was 90 minutes until we sat down. The place was extremely busy. We were staying locally so we popped into a local bar to have a drink while we waited. Staff were pleasant and attentive. Orders were taken & delivered relatively quickly although there was a mix up with the order this was quickly rectified. Portion sizes are good and so is the price. We had a bottle of wine plus 6 dishes including garlic prawns, seafood salad, Spanish omelette, calamari, pasta salad, octopus & and the total bill was €48The food was well presented and tasty. It's probably not the best tapas I've tasted but if visiting Barcelona it's well worth a try!The place definitely survives on its reputation. "
2888,7-09-2015 ,1.0,"Wandering past but not hungry after a huge lunch. We were convinced to come in . Once upstairs the waiter only offered a dinner menu. We said we weren't hungry.He said he could bring ham and cheese tapas to have with our drink. Fine.However he came with plates of ham , cheese , crumbed prawns ,garlic prawns, calamari. Meat? Toasted bread, seven plates in all. When we said no more he still served them .so instead of just drinks we ended up with a bill of € 70 euros. Not at all what we wanted or ordered.The tapas downstairs did look good and probably would have enjoyed them but being served food you did not order , or want was just not good enough. How could we enjoy this restaurant when being served food which was not what we wanted.I would therefore urge others to avoid this restaurant."
2889,7-09-2015 ,4.0,"Excellent food. The venue is quite busy but we were able to find a table. We ordered more than 8 different tapas and had a traditional beer. The food was delicious and not overpriced like Las Rambles restaurants. I would have rated lower but the food was amazing so I will leave 4 stars. The customer service must be improved. The waiters have a ""too good to be there"" attitude. He was very hasty I felt rushed however once the meal has arrived I could't care about it and we just indulged into the magnificent dishes,"
2890,7-09-2015 ,5.0,"I will not lie, it is hard to think of a meal in Barcelona I didn't enjoy, but Cerveceria Catalana is something special, they have a great ambiance, and delicious tapas. I would recommend plan to go @ an unconventional hour to beat the rush, I went at 4/5 pm and didn't have to wait long- I recommend a bottle of cava to accompany your tapas, would not miss it"
2891,7-09-2015 ,5.0,"This is quite simply the best tapas in town and the best value. You have to time it right, it's always busy and as they do not accept reservations you have to push through the crowd to get your name on that list ASAP.Try turning up at 12:30pm or around 6pm and you should be in quite quickly.The decor is functional but they always have the most beautiful flower arrangements, massive!The atmosphere is great because everyone is so relieved to get seated and the food is so delicious.Two tips, 1 take note of what food is displayed on the bar, sometimes the pinchos (little open sandwiches) aren't on the menu but they are fantastic! 2 you will need to translate the little extra menu they give you which is only in Castillian but it's the special of the day list and the best stuff is on there!Everything is delicious, love this place!"
2892,7-09-2015 ,4.0,"Nice place with good food. We had to wait about 45 minute for a table inside and by the time we went in, they were out of 1/3 of the tapas of the day. Not a problem, as everything we ordered was very good. As other reviewers said, get a table inside. It's much nicer, less noisy and there is no one smoking near your table. Our waiter was nice and prompt in taking our orders."
2893,7-09-2015 ,4.0,"Busy tapas restaurant in good location off Passieg De Gracia. Register when you arrive and wait to be called for a table, quick turnover. Seats available at tapas counter or in the large restaurant at rear. Modern and clean interior.Usual selection of hot and cold tapas, montaditos and spanish meats. Service is friendly and efficient.Good selection of spanish wines at very good prices.Overall a good dining experience with a nice bustling atmosphere."
2894,6-09-2015 ,5.0,"Don't freak out by the line. We waited about 30 min for a table (like recommended here previously, get there and sign your name) and then got a pitcher of Sangria (strong beware) and a bunch of Tapas (get the fried camembert and grilled shrimp) and has the Catalan cream and chocolate cake for dessert, absolutely dreamy. Totally worth the wait. Staff is also very nice! "
2895,6-09-2015 ,5.0,"Ordered various tapas including, grilled shrimp, peppers, fried artichokes, mini burger and everything was amazing!!"
2896,6-09-2015 ,3.0,"Was recommended to go here, and didn't get a table the first evening we went, so it's a good idea to book a table. Do NOT sit outside, the street is extremely noisy!The food was okay and not expencive, but the staff was (as it turns out, often is in Barcelona) a bit arrogant. The waitor didn't bother to look at me while I ordered, and hurried off to talk to his colleagues as soon as he had taken our order. Had to ask for the check a couple of times, we waited 15 mins to pay. "
2897,6-09-2015 ,5.0,sit on the bar - this way you can see all the dishes that comes out and just point to the barman so that you don't really have to understand or google the entire menu.ask for the tenderloin with foi gra - it's not on the menu but they made it for us - great! the prices are reasonable (3-6 euros for a dish) so that you can get a great dinner for 2 including the sangria for about 40-45 euros
2898,6-09-2015 ,4.0,"Excellent place, highly recommend. Seating outside is better but very limited. Go early otherwise long waits. The prawns (grilled) are very good."
2899,6-09-2015 ,4.0,"Our first night in Barcelona the hotel recommended this tapas bar. Great recommendation! The placed was packed and an hour wait for a table but we were able to get seats at the bar right in front of all the tapas. We think this is much better. We had figs stuffed with cream cheese and ham, fried baby octopus and a salami and cheese on an incredible slice of bread. We then told the waiter we wanted two more dishes of sea food,,his choice. he brought razor clams and sautéed shrimp Bueno sabor! the wine was very good as well"
2900,4-09-2015 ,5.0,This it the pinnacle place for good tapas and a decent bottle of wine at a very decent price! Very nice looking restaurant and the menu and wine selection is delightful. Who complains when you have a 12 euro bottle of wine and a cheese platter of Manchego? You can't lose.
2901,3-09-2015 ,4.0,"Perhaps I'm biased because I've been back here on three separate visits to Barcelona now and feel like I need to justify why I'm not branching out...But it is just so good each time that I've got no reason to stop going!I have yet to have a bad experience or a round of bad tapas here and would highly recommend it as a great lunch or dinner spot for anyone visiting Barcelona for the first or fifteenth time. I'm actually daydreaming of the pimientos y gambas y mas right now. It will likely be very busy when you go and don't even bother trying to make a reservation in advance...show up, put your name down on the waiting list, get a beer, and prepare your stomach for a wonderful culinary experience!"
2902,3-09-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent food, Amazing tapas! The food was lovely and all at a low cost! Can get very busy if you go later at night, firstly went around 6-7 and we found it got busy fairly quickly. Tried to go again at around 9 later on in the holiday and there was an hour wait for a table for 2 so go early or prepare to wait! "
2903,3-09-2015 ,5.0,"really nice tapas restaurant that don't acccept reservations. Go there, get on the list, ask how long they think it might be and have a stroll in the neighborhood. Nice area. Or buy a really nice pitcher of sangeria.We had 10 diffrent great tapas corses, a beer and a water for 44 euro. Great value and a really classy place"
2904,3-09-2015 ,5.0,"Busy and a little loud, but in a good way! We sat on the bar, the service was helpful and welcoming. The tapas were all very tasty and the portions reasonable. We highly recommend this place to tapas loves."
2905,2-09-2015 ,4.0,"Typical cerveceria located in the city the center (a side street from the famous Paseig de Garcia and very close from la Pedrera de Gaudi) where you can find a huge variety of tapas. Unfortunately I went in July which is terrible to find a place to sit since its summer and there was a lot of people queuing outside of the place, most of them tourists which led me thinking if this was not just another place for tourists. Luckily since I was having dinner alone I could avoid the queue since at the bar there's no reservations meaning if you are lucky to find a spot to sit go ahead, which I did. I went for a tapa of the day with iberico ham and melon, patatas bravas and a sandwich of solomillo and cheese which proved to be delicious and not expensive (around 13€). Topped it up with a beer since it was a very warm July night although there was also a very good selection of wines by the glass. The decor was really nice and the atmosphere was vibrating although a bit too much since the people queuing for a table were blocking the way and helping out with the background noise. Although food was great a possible drawback is that since it was full of tourists and non locals so if you want to try something typical maybe it's not the place nor season (summer time) to go there especially if you're with family with small children. Service at the bar was very helpful and super efficient. Definitely worth to come back."
2906,2-09-2015 ,4.0,"You can't come to Barcelona and not try the famous Tapas. Based on TripAdvisor reviews we decided to pay a visit to that place and try the Tapas there. We were really glad we did. An elegant restaurant with a two sided bars in addition to outdoor seats. Always crowded and does not take reservations. We visited the place on a Sunday eve for a late night dinner and still had to wait for about 45 minutes to get a table as we were on a long waiting list. The girls at the reception were nice, welcoming and always smiling. Lovely decor inside. Professional and helpful waiters. We had sea food tapas and the potato balls platter in addition to the mushroom and asparagus platter. All were great and full of taste. Portions and prices were fair. It's really a place that should be on your list."
2907,2-09-2015 ,4.0,"Our first meal in Barcelona during our first ever visit to this beautiful city was here at Cerveceria Catalana, at the suggestion of a colleague. It did not disappoint in any way. First, we were greeted by a young lady outside who explained their system, which was really helpful. You had three choices: put your name on the wait list for a table outside, on a separate list for a table inside, or take your chances and hover behind people and wait for seats at the bar to open up. We chose to wait for a table inside, and although we were quoted 45 minutes, it didn't take that long. It was nice and comfortable, and a much larger space than you'd think. We ordered sangria and tapas: patatas bravas, razor clams, shrimp ""a la plancha"", jamon iberico (of course!), grilled asparagus & mushrooms, beef tenderloin montadito, fried green peppers, and white anchovies in vinegar. Everything was made perfectly, so tasty and delicious!! But for anyone reading this...it's all about the jamon, my friends!! The sangria will creep up on you - it doesn't taste as strong as it is, but when you're on vacation and within walking distance to your hotel, who cares? It's really good and well-balanced between the fruit and alcohol. Service was good for such a busy place - friendly, timely, attentive. This experience set the bar for me, as this was my first taste of Barcelona. I would definitely come back here."
2908,1-09-2015 ,4.0,"All of the tapas here are incredibly fresh and delicious. Wait time around dinner is just about an hour so try to snag a seat at the bar to avoid a long queue. Also, you get to see all of the nice tapas in the displays which makes ordering quite easy."
2909,1-09-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent Tapas with a very friendly staff. Clean and nice restrooms. But you have to know, that there are always many people which are waiting for a table..."
2910,1-09-2015 ,5.0,"What can I say, I wanted traditional Spanish Tapas and was not disappointed. We stumbled across Cerveceria Catalana by accident and as it appeared lively, we decided to give it a go. We didn't wait long until a table became available and was promptly seated. The food was delicious and the staff very pleasant. I would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona to try out these Tapas. Very good for the money too."
2911,1-09-2015 ,4.0,"If you want great tapas in Barcelona and are prepared to arrive early or wait for a table, then this is the place to go.We waited nearly an hour to be seated on a Monday night. We were able to wait at the bar with a drink.The menu is very good with lots of options to choose from. The service once seated is very efficient. The price was also good. I will be returning next time I'm in Barcelona!"
2912,1-09-2015 ,5.0,"We went for tapas on a Saturday night. We arrived around eight and beat the crowds. The tapas were superbe, fresh, tasty and excellent value for money (surprisingly, for such a well known spot, prices are very good!). We also ordered sangria, which was great.Great experience to be repeated!"
2913,1-09-2015 ,4.0,This is one of the best tapas places in Barcelona - still going strong even with all the touristy interest. The key thing is to order from the small (Catalan language only - don't expect a translation) paper menu that shows their daily specials.
2914,29-08-2015 ,5.0,"We just had a Saturday night dinner at the Cerveceria. We arrived at 8:30 and their was a 30 minute wait for an outside table. So we bellied up to the bar in Barcelona fashion and had a few drinks and tapas while we waited. Once the table opened up and the food arrived we were glad we decided to stick it out. Every dish was delicious. We would recommend the chicken salad, the crab salad, the russian salad and the eggplant and molasses chips. The coconut and angel hair dessert was also fantastic."
2915,29-08-2015 ,5.0,"Always has a queue outside - very good tapas menu & efficient service, tables inside & outside plus a few counter seats, We went twice around 8 & had to wait 15 minutes, but when we left the wait was up to one hour. If you're staying in Eixample don't miss it - lively atmosphere and efficient service including in English."
2916,28-08-2015 ,5.0,"We went there by the recommendation of our tour guide, she mentioned that for dinner is better to get a reservation in advance. We were there for lunch and didn't had a problem to get seated. We tried the eggs with potatoes, the montadito de jabugo and the assorted tapas plate, all of them were excellent. Service is pretty good, since the menu is quite extensive they are very good at recommending you the specials and other alternatives. It is definitely a great option to try different things for a fair price, specially considering the quality of the food and ingredients."
2917,28-08-2015 ,5.0,So good we ate there twice in a 3 day trip. Every single tapas was delicious. Go during lunch as it will be less crowded.
2918,27-08-2015 ,4.0,Stopped in for lunch with concierge's recommendation. Big place and they churn out very good tapas. Not the best we had in Barcelona but still very tasty and well done. Would go again and recommend.
2919,27-08-2015 ,5.0,"I go to Barcelona often to visit my family and friends. When somebody asks me about 5 places to go when they visit Barcelona and want to try some good tapas, I always recommend this place. "
2920,27-08-2015 ,4.0,Nice restaurant with good tapas.The food came quickly and waiters were frequently looking out for our needs.
2921,27-08-2015 ,4.0,"we've been to this restaurant several times - mostly, when someone from abroad comes to visit and wants to try local tapas. the variety of food is very broad, sangria is delicious, and place is nice in general. they also have a terrace so you can sit outside.the only thing is you have to wait, there are no reservations made. sometimes it is up to 30-40 minutes that you have to wait for a table - so be patient. also, place is quite expensive and the plates are small, if you are group of people, make sure you take a good number of tapas otherwise someone will stay hungry :)"
2922,27-08-2015 ,5.0,"A short walk from Passeig de Gracia this is a solid bet for quick tapas bites at lunch away from the tourist hoardes. Frequented by lots of locals as well as tourists, get there before 130pm otherwise very very busy. Wait times normally no longer than 10/15 minutes in any case.Really nice selection of tapas with fast and efficient service."
2923,26-08-2015 ,4.0,"The tapa bar was just around the corner from our hotel, very easy for us.We arrived around 7.30 PM and had to wait only 5 minutes for a table! So a good start.We enjoyed the sangria,the little hamburgers,sardines,little fishes, papas brava,gambas and more tapas....all very good."
2924,25-08-2015 ,5.0,"Went There with my boyfriend after a beach day and it was perfect. We arrived at 7pm and the place already had a lot of people and after a couple of minutes a lot of people Were waiting for table and the line was huge.. So have that in mind..The menu has a lot of óptions, tapas, montaditos, salad,.. Pimentos padron, calamares, etc. That fries on the pictures with an egg it's also delicious, they mix it and it is really similar with batatas bravas, which are delicious too. For dessert I eat a limon tart, good and not sweet at all. The food was really good and fresh but the beer was awesome too, this restaurant háve many different beers on the menu that you may try. I liked a lot of Chimay from belgium but you can have beer from México, Usa,.. As well. "
2925,24-08-2015 ,5.0,"We had a great lunch here. A lot of the courses we had were typical Spanish dishes, similar to others we had elsewhere - tomato bread, green chillies etc - but they were without fail better than elsewhere.The best dish we had - calamari and mushrooms - was purely based on 'dish envy' of the table next to us.Service was very good and we were lucky enough to have a table outside.A definite 'must try' while in Barcelona."
2926,24-08-2015 ,5.0,Spent five days in Barcelona on what amounted to an eating your. This was absolutely one of our most favorite places. Our only regret was that we couldn't try everything. Rare.y have I been to a restaurant where the food looked so pleasing to the eye and fresh. Would recommend a seat at the bar if at all possible. Wonderful to enjoy seeing everything happen right in from of you.
2927,24-08-2015 ,5.0,I have been here for lunch twice nice. First taken my a local and second was a random recommendation by the Alma Hotel (turned out to be the same place). Very well priced and good food. Definitely a lunch recommendation.
2928,23-08-2015 ,4.0,"First time here on the tip of a friend who loves Barcelona. We were lucky to have gotten in with no wait at about 6:00 pm on a Sunday. Got sangria and the combo tapas plate along with cheese and jamon. It was tasty and I would definitely go back to try other plates. We were really surprised to see that there was a line out the door when we left, having no idea how popular this place is. Not sure if I would wait more than 15 minutes for a seat (surely, there are other places that are good??). Glad we got in. The staff are efficient if not overly friendly and they all seem to speak English (I’m guessing many of them are Filipino?)."
2929,23-08-2015 ,5.0,We were staying round the corner and were intrigued by the long queues and activity around the evening as we walked past. We decided on try it one evening. There was an hour and 30 wait so we left it. The same again the next evening. 3 rd time lucky for us however and we managed to get a table within 20 mins. I've been to Barcelona approx 8 times and this meal by far surpassed any meal we have eaten here. And great value you. We had around 10 tapas plates and a bottle of wine for around 50 euros. If you can get lucky and not have to wait I would definitely recommend. Actually even if you do have to wait it's probably worth it. 
2930,23-08-2015 ,5.0,Friends took us here. I have been to Barcelona before and dropped in to tapas bars and been underwhelmed. But here the choices were more interesting and sophisticated. Be prepared to wait in line!
2931,23-08-2015 ,3.0,really long waiting list but good food :)okay for tourists but if you'll be living in barcelona you can easily find better places
2932,22-08-2015 ,5.0,"Had to come back a secnd time. Loved it so much. We weren't alone, clearly, but definitely worth the wait for a table. The next day though, we jumped at seats at the bar to avoid the wait. Excellent and very reasonable food. Extensive menu. Mushroom and jamon risotto so good.. Foie gras montadito very generous. EUR3.90 for a huge chunk of foie!! Great atmosphere and convenient location."
2933,22-08-2015 ,4.0,"It is my four time at this restaurant. It is always nice to comeback! To wait , sometimes for an hour , but the food and the atmosphere worth it!You have"
2934,22-08-2015 ,5.0,"I visited this restaurant 10 months ago and walked away disappointed. I returned again and had a completely different experience.The reason I left an average review last time was because we ordered dishes we thought were for sharing and thought the portions were small. I think the waiters should explain the menu a bit to begin with as this would be helpful. Some dishes are for sharing and some are solo. The dishes that are described as 'sandwiches' are just tapas dishes that come with bread. Not a traditional sandwich.So we had a different experience this time, after waiting an hour (worth it) we tried 4/5 different dishes which were all amazing. The camembert cheese sticks, egg and fries and the mini steaks were incredible. However the best dish of all was the 6 textures of chocolate cake. Best dessert i've ever had"
2935,22-08-2015 ,5.0,"Without doubt, one of the hippest, coolest and most delicious tapas bars in Eixample. Make sure you go there. Incredibly fresh seafood and fantastic food, service and atmosphere. People spilling out everywhere, which made it all the more fun.For my family of 3, with a big appetite, and drinks, we paid just under 100 euro. yes, pretty pricey, but absolutely delicious and worth every cent. Be patient and try to sit at the bar. We have eaten there several times."
2936,21-08-2015 ,5.0,By far some of the best tapas I've had. My co-workers and I ate here for dinner and we were not disappointed. The hardest part was trying to decide what we wanted to try. I loved the grilled squid and the grilled shrimp. My co-workers thoroughly enjoyed the sangria. Be prepared to wait for a table since its very busy. I would definitely eat here again.
2937,21-08-2015 ,4.0,From the outside there's not much to see here. Step inside and keep walking. This place is big. Food is Tapas of every variety plus meals if you're sick of Tapas. Service good. Prices also ok but there's cheaper if you're on a tight budget. Service is quick and efficient. Ask for a seat at the front of he restaurant. The place lacks atmosphere the further back you go. 
2938,21-08-2015 ,4.0,"If you ever want to visit this restaurant for lunch, make sure you are early! We reached around 1:30 and it was already packed. We managed to get a seat outside before swarms of people started coming in and there wasn't any seating at all left! Staff had to take down names and tell people to wait in line for 30 minutes. The queue also snakes from inside the restaurant all the way outside. We had a spanish omelette, grilled cuttlefish, cod and grilled mushrooms. All were really good and I can't really pick a favourite. Service can be a little distracted though, perhaps due to the crowds? But it was hard to get the waiters' attention and couldn't seem to focus on what we were ordering at all. It's a nice place though and well worth the walk from Gracia!"
2939,20-08-2015 ,5.0,This restaurant is fantastic! Stayed in Barcelona for 2 nights and we ate here 3 times! I wanted to go back a 4th time! Prices were reasonable as well. Looking forward to going back to Barcelona so I can come here again!
2940,20-08-2015 ,5.0,"We were told to come here by a our foodie friend and we were not disappointed! The food was delicious, so much so that we had to order more patatas bravas! The staff were very helpful and spoke English. The interior was lovely and tasteful. I would definetly come again."
2941,20-08-2015 ,5.0,"Read many reviews and simply wanted to explore the best tapas bar in Barcelona with my family. Arrived pretty early to avoid long queue of people (18:30) and although there was already a queue, we were seated within 15min. Ordered many fish ones and the prawn skewers are just sensational. Friendly and welcoming staff is working their socks off and the speed of food being delivered is incredible. Explore this restaurant - definitely worth it"
2942,19-08-2015 ,5.0,"Fantastic meal with Sangria, tapas and our favourites, montaditos. Service was smooth, food was so tasty. The hostess ladies run a tight-ship and handle the reservations and the walk-ins very crisply. They also remind women not to leave purses hanging over the back of their chairs as they escort diners to their tables. Get there early unless you like to wait an hour. "
2943,19-08-2015 ,5.0,"This is the best value for money restaurant I have ever tried. It is simple, but very delicious and then price is very very low. Be aware that you can not make table reservation, but show up and while you wait for the table to get ready you can have some wine or tapas snack in the bar"
2944,18-08-2015 ,4.0,If you want to experience good Spanish tapas this is the place to go. Food is muy delicioso. There is a queue to get to eat here but it is worth it. Come early to beat the crowd. They are open 09:00am to 01:30am. Excellent service from their staff. They give recommendations too and service is fast. If you cannot decide from the menu go to the bar and check out the food platters displayed and order from there. Top on our list were the boquerones and grilled shrimps.
2945,18-08-2015 ,1.0,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this restaurant at all! I went there twice with some friends around 8pm and we were told both times we had to wait for a table between 1h45min inside or 2h30min outside. Of course that was no option. As there is always such a long waiting list, we thought it has to be worth waiting and went there again at 7pm. This time we only had to wait one hour for a table.Now the disaster began:In total we were served by three different incompetent and annoyed waiters. We ordered different softdrinks and a bottle of wine, but never received the wine.Everyone of us ordered 4-5 different tapas - around 18 in total. We would have loved to eat all at the same time, but every five minutes arrived on of the ordered tapas. So when I was almost finished with eating dinner, one of my friends hadn't even received one of his ordered tapas. In addition, we had ordered in total 3 mini burgers, but received only one and we had to ask the waiters three more times for the missing ones.The whole atmosphere is very hectic and fussy, and not very pleasant for a relaxed dinner.In addition, also the bill we received was not right, but overcharged (5 mini burgers, instead of 3 - and other mistakes).After having dinner there, two of the four of us even got sick with stomachache and diarrhea."
2946,18-08-2015 ,5.0,"Ask for the 5 tapas menu, one beer called estrella from tap and a coconut flan and be happy! The tapas were delicious."
2947,18-08-2015 ,5.0,"Ask for anything. You won´t regret any choice. We were 14 people so we got to ask for a bit of everything and it was all absolutely delicious. These were without a doubt the best tapas I have ever had, at a very affordable price for the quality. The service is good and quick and the ambience is very nice as well. Fantastic restaurant. Will definetely come back when I stop by Barcelona again."
2948,17-08-2015 ,5.0,"No, that would be a disgrace to this restaurant. They want you to wait for 2 hours? Do it, you won't regret it. We recommend the Cured Ham on bread. "
2949,17-08-2015 ,5.0,We had an amazing lunch here whilst visiting Barca for my boyfriends birthday weekend. If we were staying for longer we would definitely have had another meal here. Love tapas! Great flavours and a busy place but still quick and efficient service. Will hopefully be back sometime soon! 
2950,16-08-2015 ,4.0,"We went to this restaurant around 7:30pm and we just been able to find table outside on the terrace. After 5 or 10 minutes the people were forming queues waiting for a table.The food was nice, and also the service was efficient, in fair prices. The truth is that I didn't find that ""woao"" factor that I was expecting. Maybe it's too fuzz for just a nice tapas restaurant? (like this there are many more in the city)."
2951,15-08-2015 ,5.0,Tonight we had our best meal in Barcelona in every respect. Although a reservation can't be made it's worth waiting the hour or so (around the corner have a drink) for your table to be ready. The service is excellent and the tapas were great. Would definitely return. Enjoy!
2952,15-08-2015 ,5.0,We wondered if Cerveceria Catalana was going to be worth the 30 minute wait ... the answer: most definitely! The best beer selection we found in Barcelona coupled with a range of amazing tapas.
2953,15-08-2015 ,5.0,We waited for being served for more or less one hour at 8.30 pm but it was a good idea to wait. We spended this time drinking some cervecas and starting with some tapas. Then at the promised time we were accompanied at our table. Service was perfect ant food more than perfect. Don't miss this place!
2954,14-08-2015 ,5.0,"No reservation so be prepared to queue , but worth the wait the food is very good. The Tapas of the day is in Spanish only but the waiter's are very helpful.A bottle of house wine is around 10 EurosEnjoy"
2955,14-08-2015 ,5.0,I been at Cerveceria Catalana many times and the tapas is always of very high quality. The place is quite crowded and that often gives the place a somewhat stressful feeling. Despite that the it is a must visit in Barcelona if you want to eat tapas.
2956,13-08-2015 ,5.0,"We had a list of the 10 best tapasbars in Barcelona, and we selected 4 of them to discover : Cerveceria Catalana and 3 other other : Jai-ca, Meson David and Bar Morrysom (but closed for holidays) … attention : there are more top-tapasbars closed in the month of August (Quimet & Quimet, La Cova Fumada, …)Cerveceria Catalana is situated steps away from Rambla de Catalunya and metro station Diagonal in Carrer de Mallorca 236. This is a large, clean, modern and good run tapasbar, frequented by locals and tourists. We went here for early lunch (12AM) and could grab the last table outside. Fairly perfect and fast service. Good portions, good quality and modest prices : sparkling water perrier 2,15€, café con leche 2,10€, a platter for 2 with 6 different tapas 15,95€, all kinds of montaditos (small slice of bread with salmon, filled red peppers, etc…) for 1,55€/pc. We could stay here the rest of the afternoon, eating tapas !!"
2957,13-08-2015 ,3.0,"We tried to get a table several times, but gave up after waiting and went elsewhere. We eventually got in for lunch and was disappointed. The food was very well priced, but pretty average. We had far better in other places. It felt very much like a fast food restaurant. The daily specials were only in Spanish, so it was hard to understand. Not really worth the hype. "
2958,13-08-2015 ,5.0,"Very good tapas bar.Like every good tapas bar, you might need to wait to get a place, but once you are in, the food is amazing and it's very cheap.A must try"
2959,13-08-2015 ,4.0,Walked in here for an early lunch at around 11 am. The bar area was packed but they seated us immediately at the table by the kitchen. The service was good. Our waitress was attentive and able to answer any questions we had. The Crispy Brie cheese with nuts and marmalade was my absolute favorite! Wow! I could've eaten more of those but I wanted to try other food.The Patatas Bravas were also delicious! The aioli sauce on top had a little kick which was just right.The Ham Croquetas were okay. The Jabugo Cured Ham sandwich was okay too.I wish we could have tried more items but we were stuffed!
2960,13-08-2015 ,5.0,"Landed up randomly at this place on our first day in Barcelona. . Was blown away by the food the beef tapas was the best I have eaten in my life .. and hits kept coming .. the prawn , clams etcEvery dish was great or better .. we were a gang of 6 .. took a long time to get a table .. the place is always full... even on a Monday night .. went there three times ..The staff is to the point and always in a hurry. . Definitely go here u will not regret it !!!"
2961,12-08-2015 ,5.0,I come to Barcelona in the summers and we go here every year since we absolutely love the food Service is a little slow but it is completely worth it
2962,12-08-2015 ,4.0,"Have been here several times on advice of a friend who lives in Barça! It's always busy so be prepared to wait at the bar and enjoy yourself with for example, some cold cava and with a few nice first bites of this great kitchen. If you're looking for some 'real' Catalan tapas, join this place, it's pretty good."
2963,12-08-2015 ,5.0,"Lovely tapas, really wide choice of items, helpful staff. As we had our 6 year old we ate early. If you go about 6pm you won't have to queue, any later and you probably will but simply put your name down on the list go and have a drink at a surrounding bar and pop back in half an hour. Unfortunately you can't book in advance. We had a lovely dinner."
2964,11-08-2015 ,3.0,"This is a place only for tourists since it is impossible to book and it's always packed but mainly because of the fast tapas.The food is nice, average but bot worth the crazy waiting list."
2965,11-08-2015 ,5.0,The food is amazing!! But deff recommend to have early dinner here or really late!!! As there are always waiting lines!!
2966,11-08-2015 ,5.0,"Loved this place...ate at sister restaurant Condal, and loved it as well..try to sit at the counter, order the sample platter, pate with melted cheese and what ever else your eyes take in...it's All good here for tourists and Locals!!!"
2967,11-08-2015 ,3.0,"This seems to be a hotspot in Barcelona, you have to make an reservation upon arrival, and we had to wait for 1,5 hour to be seated. Well with this long waiting time, you expect something you have never tasted before! But unfortunately this wasn't the case, the food was good but you can get same quality or even better at many different restaurants throughout Barcelona but without a waiting list."
2968,10-08-2015 ,4.0,"We were just a party of two, so we got in on a busy Thursday night at around 8 pm after 25 minutes or so. Extremely busy restaurant, which provides for a fun, international vibe. Food was excellent, however the menu had no descriptions for most of the dishes (in any language) and the wait staff was polite, but always in a rush so we were not able to make as many good choices as we probably could have. We saw dishes going to other tables that we wish we would have known how to order. Therefore, unless you are a tapas veteran, I would suggest getting some suggestions ahead of time, especially for the 'salad' descriptions. What we did order was excellent but we left knowing their likely were some epic choices missed. Great location just one block off of Rambla de Catalunya."
2969,9-08-2015 ,5.0,"Unless you come for an early lunch, around 12-12.30h. From 1 pm, be prepared for a 30-45 min wait. It's worth the wait, though. The prices are fair, the tapas are very good, fresh, prepared on order. The desserts are also great, especially the ""pastel de chocolate"". Coffee is the best I had outside Italy. We came to the place twice, the first time the waiter chose the tapas for us, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The draft beer is not on the meny, but it is the best choice for a good lager at honest price. With so many reviews, I'm not getting into much further detail. This is one of those must come places. If you don't have the patience to wait, there is another very good place for tapas and paella just a couple of blocks away, in Passeig de Gracia."
2970,9-08-2015 ,4.0,Arrived on a very busy Sunday at 1pm. Told we would need to wait 15 mins for a table but ready in 5 minutes. We had tapas and were able to order extra dishes as we went along. Food was hot and fresh. Staff very busy but friendly and efficient. Great for a quick lunch.
2971,8-08-2015 ,4.0,"it gets pretty pack but their tapas, esp. seafood tapas, were made fresh! love the atmosphere and we will def come back!"
2972,8-08-2015 ,5.0,"Amazing place to go for lunch or dinner. Even though it's full of people, and tourists especially, the food is gourmet and in good quality. On lunch they have an extra meniu of tapas of the day. Prepare to wait for a table from 30 mins to 1 hour. But the best places are near the bar, where you can really choose not from the meniu, but what u can see in front of you."
2973,7-08-2015 ,5.0,"People queue to get a table at this restaurant and, when we tasted the food, it was clear why! We had to wait about an hour to get a table but it was really worth the wait. The food is delicious, really reasonably priced and there’s such a choice of different dishes to try. The food arrived quickly after we’d ordered and the staff were really great."
2974,7-08-2015 ,5.0,"I loved the tapas, especially the beef tenderloin and the camembert where amazing! In the evening i recommend to get dressed a little bit chic- we went there in a group of ten and waited about an hour for a table- but it was absolutely worth it!"
2975,6-08-2015 ,1.0,"If you're looking to blow a whole night waiting for distinctly mediocre food - this is the place! (They HAVE to be paying for the positive reviews.) After stupidly waiting for almost two hours (constantly being assured that a table would open up soon by a seemingly sweet hostess who was actually seating locals before tourists), we were finally seated in a loud and unattractive dining room. Among the tapas we were served: a ""foie gras"" and Roquefort sandwich that the server laughingly admitted was ""some kind of pork spread"" that was closer to cat food than foie gras. Red flag we should have recognized: very young crowd who was more likely drawn to the prices than the food quality. (Or maybe these are the diners being paid for their reviews!) Bottom line: this place isn't worth waiting two minutes, never mind two hours. "
2976,6-08-2015 ,5.0,"The fine staff at our hotel (Alma Barcelona) turned us on to this place. It was the BEST food we had in this city and that says a lot because the food in Barcelona cant be beat. We went to a few other tapas bars/restaurants during our trip but quickly returned to this one because ALL the food is delicious.Be sure to try the Iberian Ham on those delicious little breads that they bring to the table. The sliders (mini burgers) are a MUST.. they are amazing. We also loved the fried Calamari. Of course, grab some sangria to go with the food.This place is worth the wait.. and there probably will be a wait.Most people in Barcelona eat late so we would try to arrive before 7p. Later than that and the place is packed with a long wait.. or try lunch.. If you do arrive later and there is a wait.. it is worth the wait!"
2977,5-08-2015 ,5.0,"We stopped here with our three children (10,8 &7) for a quick lunch and it was excellent. The staff were very friendly and attentive; the food came quickly, there was a large range of tapas which we all enjoyed trying. The facilities were clean and the aircon was much appreciated in the August heat."
2978,5-08-2015 ,5.0,"Lunch for 4 including beers and a bottle of Rosie was a very reasonable 82€This was our 4th visit over the past 3 years and a stand out place to enjoy the best that Barcelona has to offer - it's food!Highly recommend - good food and wine, great service"
2979,4-08-2015 ,5.0,"We had dinner here on one evening of our stay as it was beside our hotel and it was really good, a lovely ceaser salad with tomato bread and spicy potatoes. Very simple and delicious. Very busy spot which is always a good sign...and we went back for breakfast the following day... keep up the good work. "
2980,4-08-2015 ,5.0,"Great tapas -- the place is always packed so be prepared to wait. No waiting if you get lucky and sit at the front ""bar""."
2981,4-08-2015 ,5.0,Incredible tapas at low prices meant we didn't want to leave even when we were full!The menu is fresh and extensive and this place is a must for people who enjoy Catalonia's fine cuisine.
2982,3-08-2015 ,5.0,This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend and it was my favourite restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic and so cheap. We tried several other restaurants in the city but wish we had come back to this one again before we left. I have since recommended it to 4 friends and they all absolutely loved it. One of them went 3 times during her 4 days in the city. Defo have the burger and the potato bravas. I hear the tenderloin beef is fantastic too.
2983,3-08-2015 ,5.0,This was exactly the kind of restaurant I was hoping to find. Lovely authentic tapas bar but also of a high standard and good quality food and service. If visiting Barcelona again I would return in a heartbeat. 
2984,3-08-2015 ,5.0,Great tapas. I would recommend it as the first restaurant to go to in Barcelona. Has the best crema catalana. 
2985,3-08-2015 ,4.0,I went here 2 times in my 4 days in Barcelona as I enjoyed it that much! The sangria is amazingly refreshing and smooth and the choice of fresh tapas is unbelievable. The deserts are incrrdible too.It is also very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend siting outside to take in the light city atmosphere.
2986,2-08-2015 ,4.0,Food is excellent. Servers appear very unhappy and unfriendly. There seems to be some trouble between them. Have to get in pretty early to get a table.
2987,2-08-2015 ,5.0,"Heard about this place in 2014 when I was in Barcelona and when I went back last month, I had to go back.It may be a long wait, but trust me, its definitely worth it. Food comes out fast and its super delicious. Reminds me of Pintxos bars in Donostia, Spain!You won't regret it!"
2988,2-08-2015 ,5.0,"Although you can't book at this restaurant in advance, the wait is well worth it. Efficient staff with extraordinary service, polite, friendly and professional. The food is exquisite. Whisked out with minimal wait, and to a Michelin star standard. Would highly recommend this to anyone seeking authentic Spanish cuisine. "
2989,2-08-2015 ,5.0,"I visited Cerveceria Catalana with my family on a day trip to Barcelona, after it was recommended in our guidebook. It was busy when we entered at about 7pm, but we were left waiting for no longer than 5 minutes before being seated. The restaurant was modern and clean, with elegant decor.Within minutes we were asked what we would like to drink, and not having had tapas before, went for the assorted tapas plate to share. All dishes served on the plate were absolutely delicious, and we went on to order several more dishes which were all equally good. The food was brought out within 10 minutes of ordering, and all of the plates were brought out at the same time. The only minor flaw was that one of the extra dishes we ordered was missing, however we realised quickly that we had over-ordered, so it was no issue.We were pleasantly surprised by the value of the food, and would have happily paid a lot more for the fantastic quality of the food and generous portions. All in all it was a fantastic experience and the food was exquisite!"
2990,2-08-2015 ,4.0,"Well the place was fully booked , there is no way at finding a place so you should wait and trust me it is worth the wait!Great tapas and sangria. Loved the foie gras and octupos tapas."
2991,2-08-2015 ,4.0,"The missus and I ended up here after recommendations from family and friends. Good points:-food quality and variation is excellent (see tips below)-food presentation good-service after being seated is efficient -nice and relaxed atmosphere in a trendy street in central Barcelona -price is fair for the quality of food served upBad points:-if it is your first time, you must put your name down straight away with the hostess (two separate lists one for outside and one for inside). Waiting times can be up to an hour so be prepared to stand around utilising all the patience you have stored up during a relaxing holiday. If you are lucky enough to grabs seats at the tapas bars (there are two on either side when you come in), you can enjoy a couple of drinks and a few nibbles while you are waiting for your table (the bill can be transferred to your table thereafter) -a previous reviewer kindly highlighted that a section of the restaurant has a small leak above a four seater table which I remembered when we were seated on the same table. After my request to move us, we were seated immediately on another table. My problem here is that the restaurant has a large capacity with high turnover of tables to make do without this problem-they don't take bookings unless it's a large groupFood and drinks tip:-mini baguette of fresh tuna, anchovies, tomatoes and olive oil is simple but refreshing (one portion per person)-mini burger topped with caramelised onion and cheddar cheese is a delight (one portion per person)...note, they run out of the burgers quickly on a busy night-caramelised goat's cheese on a bed of nicely seasoned roasted aubergines and red peppers gives you a mix of nice Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavours (one portion is enough for two people)-filled pepper with its strong smoky flavour stuffed with cod purée just strong enough flavour of the fish coming through was worth the money too (one portion per two people)-one bad note we have experienced in all tapas restaurants in Barcelona (including this one) were the cleanliness of the prawns unfortunately. Yes, we can be fussy eaters but we really hate when the prawns have not been cleaned properly as it can alter the taste of the prawns no matter how fresh they are-we had many sangrias in different restaurants and we think this restaurant served up the best of all in terms of mix of flavours and strength of alcohol..be aware, they can get you tipsy quickly All in all, if you have patience to wait for a table, you won't be disappointed. "
2992,1-08-2015 ,5.0,"If you like a tasty food and you are in barcelona, you should to go there to find out something different - the best tapas in barcelona appended by the specific atmosphere. The dark side is that you have to wait min half an hour for a table. Best time to go there is 5-7pm"
2993,1-08-2015 ,5.0,this place was recommended by the concierge at the hotel we were staying. there is always long wait. 20-40 mins on our experience. but the tapas are so good! we went there back to back!
2994,31-07-2015 ,5.0,We went to Cerveceria Catalana on a recommendation of our hotel concierge. The tapas and sangria were outstanding! Get there before 8pm as lines can get long. We ordered many different tapas and all were very good. The servers were prompt and friendly. The bar area at the entrance had many delicious options and the restaurant atmosphere was great!
2995,31-07-2015 ,5.0,"This is the best Tapas in Barcelona,we try last night, and for sure to go back again.My child love the mini burgers and hot dog. Have to try when visit Barcelona."
2996,31-07-2015 ,4.0,"Typical cerveceria located in the city the center (a side street from the famous Paseig de Garcia and very close from la Pedrera de Gaudi) where you can find a huge variety of tapas. Unfortunately I went in July which is terrible to find a place to sit since its summer and there was a lot of people queuing outside of the place, most of them tourists which led me thinking if this was not just another place for tourists. Luckily since I was having dinner alone I could avoid the queue since at the bar there's no reservations meaning if you are lucky to find a spot to sit go ahead, which I did. I went for a tapa of the day with iberico ham and melon, patatas bravas and a sandwich of solomillo and cheese which proved to be delicious and not expensive (around 13€). Topped it up with a beer since it was a very warm July night although there was also a very good selection of wines by the glass. The decor was really nice and the atmosphere was vibrating although a bit too much since the people queuing for a table were blocking the way and helping out with the background noise. Although food was great a possible drawback is that since it was full of tourists and non locals so if you want to try something typical maybe it's not the place nor season (summer time) to go there especially if you're with family with small children. Service at the bar was very helpful and super efficient. Definitely worth to come back. "
2997,31-07-2015 ,4.0,"It is so horrible much hype around this restaurant. There are Beatles tendencies there in the evening if you want a table. If you are alone go past the queue and order at the bar. That feels so good. The food is classic cooked in a terrific way. Unfortunately, here too is the service just too bad. They have everything for a lot of people and you lose a little bit the feeling of such a buzz. I advise you to go at noon around 12:00. Then you board. All rude Russians asleep and you get light tables outside."
2998,30-07-2015 ,5.0,This was our favorite meal during our five day stay in Barcelona. Everything we ordered was delicious. Really fun sitting at the bar. 
2999,30-07-2015 ,5.0,"Love the awesome tapas and the huge sangria :-). Must have the grilled cuttlefish, red shrimp/gambas and razor clams if available (usually on the menu of the day). For dessert, the best coconut pudding ever or the 'Crema Catalana' (creme brulee) and a 'cortado' FYI, there is a separate 'wait list' for outside seating."
3000,30-07-2015 ,4.0,"Sunday in Barcelona sees many tapas bars closed, but luckily for us, this great place was open. Speedy service, good tapas, incl. those little baquettes with white pork sausage! Yum!"
3001,30-07-2015 ,4.0,"This place was highly recommended, and we ended up eating tapas here twice (during a one-week trip). The service is good and the tapas delicious, but it's quite expensive. "
3002,30-07-2015 ,5.0,I was recommended to go to Cerveceria Catalana.The place and location are great.We liked the athmosphere and wave of the place. Will deffinitely come again on our next trip to Barcelona.
3003,29-07-2015 ,5.0,"Very nice tapas with nice atmosphere and people! Absolute recommended. Beware that you will always need to spend time for waiting before getting your table. But once you got one, it's worth the effort!"
3004,28-07-2015 ,5.0,"A very good meal with exceptional service after a long day of touring. Long wait, but worth it. Grab a cava and people watch for a while. They are good at managing expectations in terms of wait time, and while the wait may seem long, time passes quickly. The food was very good and the children enjoyed as well. Salamat!"
3005,28-07-2015 ,5.0,"This is such a great tapas place that we had to wait 40 mins to get a table because the line was so long. The portions are tiny so we had to order 2 of each (we were 4 people). We ordered the patatas bravas, mini hamburger, mini hotdog, piementos, fried camembert, tomato bread, beef tenderloin, fried calamari, shrimp with garlic sauce, and the foie gras sandwich. Everything was fantastic and we left nothing on our plates."
3006,27-07-2015 ,4.0,Visited again after an absence of nearly three years but this time for a slow leisurely lunch...great quality and choice with very friendly staff make this a good place to visit.The only negative for me are the people waiting for a table on the pavement near the tables...it can be a bit off putting but it does show the popularity of the restaurant.Well worth the effort to get to it...go and see for yourself!
3007,27-07-2015 ,5.0,This restaurant gets good reviews on Travel Advisor and Yelp and rightly so. It is constantly packed at lunch and dinner. Best to have an early lunch or dinner. The wait staff is good and speaks English which is a big plus. They also have English menus. Everything is real good and reasonably priced. I particularly like the Arroz Negros which is one of the best I ever had. Highly recommended.
3008,27-07-2015 ,5.0,"WOW amazing tapas and staff. It is very busy and you will have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it, we only waited half hour for a table, but there was only two of us. We went there two nights on the trot it was Excellent. Don't order to much at once, keep the menu and just keep ordering more till you are full. Everything we had was fantastic."
3009,26-07-2015 ,5.0,"We stumbled upon this place and loved the food, the atmosphere, the staff. It's great because you can try so many great Spanish dishes. Well worth the visit, wherever you are in Barcelona. Enjoy!"
3010,25-07-2015 ,4.0,If you want to eat great local food like Taps this is the place. Don't forget to order the bread and the small burgers. Try to make a reservation in advance. The line are long
3011,25-07-2015 ,5.0,"The restaurant is always busy which is quite telling. The food is AMAZING and there is so much variety. I was in Barcelona recently for a week and I ate there five times. It's that good! The best spot is at the bar as they have the tapas all laid out in front of you and you can pick and choose what you want. If you find that you have to wait, hang in there as the tapas at Cerveceria Catalana is definitely worth it."
3012,25-07-2015 ,5.0,"second visit, still absolutely love it. Mini burgers are die to for, the fish is fresh and tasty, the menu so incredibly varied you can definitely visit twice and the daily selections only make this better! Be adventurous, try new stuff and enjoy!"
3013,24-07-2015 ,5.0,"Authentic, popular and great place for tapas. We arrived at 2.30pm and had to wait 20 mins for a table but that helped build the excitement and the beer was good.We got a little table and had fun ordering off the English menu but also the tapas of the day menu in Spanish. The dishes were lovely - patatas bravas was great, the prawn sticks were delicious and the simple mushroom plate was good too with its basil pesto dressing.Service was efficient, quick yet friendly.We will going back for sure- probably even tonight!! "
3014,24-07-2015 ,3.0,"This tapas bar is certainly popular and advance bookings are not accepted. Instead you add your name to a waiting list....and wait!We were a group of 6 visiting on a Thursday night, had had to wait over an hour for a table.The food is ok, like any other tapas I've eaten, however this place certainly has a reputation for good food"
3015,23-07-2015 ,5.0,"Busy and cosy place. Very authentic! Lovely tapas, you can sit in the bar and choose what you want from behind the glassbar. "
3016,23-07-2015 ,1.0,"We had this restaurant mapped out in our itinerary for our visit to Barcelona. It was our first night in Barcelona and we were so excited to try this restaurant. What compelled me to write this review was the ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE service! Our server, Raquel, was an absolute displeasure to deal with. The server showed no interest in us and she was unhelpful and unfriendly. Where we were sitting, near the wall, the ceiling was dripping some kind of liquid (it could be water, we are not sure). We were told that it is likely coming from the air conditioning/HVAC system. This liquid dripped onto our seats, our clothes, our table, and onto the food! We asked the server to move us to another table, as this could not be considered sanitary. We waited for 15 minutes and nothing was done. We would note that there were empty tables available around us and the restaurant was not that busy at 6:30 pm. Finally, we were so disgusted that we paid our bill and left to go to another restaurant. On top of this, the food was mediocre at best - nothing spectacular.I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone for the lack service and most importantly for sanitary reasons. There are plenty of restaurants in Barcelona that serve better food with far better service. This was definitely the worst experience we had in Barcelona. 1 out of 5 stars is an understatement."
3017,22-07-2015 ,5.0,Been there several times. Food display is amazing!! Different types of salads and small open faced sandwiches on one side of the bar. The other side (my favorite) it the hot dishes and grill bar where you can order seafood and anything else. It's hard to choose. I suggest you befriend the bar tenter and ask him what's best on today's menu. Have a Clara for a drink. It's a lager with lemon very refreshing on a hot summer day. You will have more then one trust me!! They have good wines as well and great Cava. For a shorter wait go for brunch on a weekday. Evenings are really busy. You could wait up to an hour or two. But well worth the wait!!! ENJOY!!
3018,22-07-2015 ,5.0,This restaurant was so good that we went there twice in one week. The food was excellent as well as the wait staff. It was a pleasurable dining experience. You definitely want to arrive early and try to eat inside.
3019,22-07-2015 ,4.0,Great tapas and service. I liked all the fresh tapas and they service that help us with the food. A lot of pepole so be in time. 
3020,22-07-2015 ,5.0,"Our flight to Barcelona was delayed and we missed our dinner reservation. Lucky for us we remembered this restaurant was recommended by several friends and taxied over. We were told an hour and 1/2 wait and it was Leah 10:30! We walked around, came back after 40 minutes and were seated! We quickly understood what the fuss was about.Food was delicious and interesting, and we enjoyed every mouthful. The tapas kept coming and we needed to order four desserts because we just didn't want to leave!"
3021,21-07-2015 ,5.0,"Long line, but the wait wasn't as long as they projected. Sign in, go for a neighborhood walk, come back and enjoy the wide selection of tapas."
3022,21-07-2015 ,5.0,"Definitely visit here if you are in Barcelona. Yes, you have to queue, but it moves fairly quickly, so don't be put off. The food is delicious and the service is quick without you feeling rushed. We'll be back!"
3023,21-07-2015 ,5.0,"If you're going for Tapas, and your hotel is a stone throw away, why go anywhere else? The specials were enough to keep the menu interesting and are utterly delicious. Beware - its very popular with the locals too, so either get there early, or be prepared to wait."
3024,21-07-2015 ,4.0,Very nice and busy place. We put our name down for a table and waited at the bar for 15 minutes until we got seated. Service was friendly and fast. The tapas were excellent. Good choice of wine. Left about an hour later and the line was huge. Worthwhile going there.
3025,21-07-2015 ,5.0,Long waiting line but got a place in the bar. Excellent experience and the Tapas were the best in town.
3026,20-07-2015 ,4.0,"Very nice place, lot's of people waiting to get a table but is moving fast so you don't have to wait too long.Tapas are very good, everyone has probably his favorite :)Service is good, friendly and relatively fast for the people passing through."
3027,20-07-2015 ,5.0,I was recommended Cerveceria Catalana by a work colleague and it didn't disappoint. I was on my own so managed to get a spot at the bar on a very busy night. I had the assorted tapas and a glass of house red. It was delicious!
3028,20-07-2015 ,4.0,"Gets packed around dinner time so you can try to go earlier as we did. It was fancier than the other tapas places we went to, food was also good. The place to go to if you want a less hectic tapas experience."
3029,19-07-2015 ,5.0,"Fantastic selection of of authentic tapas, but be warned you should book if you are not prepared to wait, we did wait and it was one of our best nights out! We waited 1hr but we enjoyed an amazing bustley atmosphere and the tapas was lovely. Really fresh and gorgeous! We enjoyed every dish! "
3030,19-07-2015 ,5.0,Fantastic tapas! Worth the wait. Good food. Best with group to sample as much as you can. Don't forget a pitcher of sangria.
3031,19-07-2015 ,5.0,"I'd been recommended this place by a friend who'd also recently visited Barcelona. We arrived at about 9.30pm knowing we'd have to put our name on the list to wait for a table - there was a 30minute wait so we went to a nearby bar for a Sangria! Returning later we were soon taken to our table (it was very busy round the entrance so just need to bustle your way through to the restaurant area!) where the service was really friendly giving us plenty of time to choose our tapas. We had the mixed tapas which was incredible (king prawns, croquettes, fried anchovies, clams, green peppers) plus tomato bread & a platter of local meats all washed down with some more Sangria! Everything including the atmosphere was great too such that we were tempted to go back another evening during the holiday! Highly recommended."
3032,19-07-2015 ,5.0,"Grat tapas and very resonable price. Very busy place but choice, taste and quality is very high. Not all of personel speaks English. I reccomend mainly always very fresh fruits of the sea. Also baked goat cheese is good to reccomend.Visite in the evening without reservation is rather impossible."
3033,18-07-2015 ,5.0,First restaurant I have eaten at in Spain and after two weeks still the best. The tapas were incredible there must have been close to 70 choices and I couldn't fault one. You definitely want to get a seat at the bar as the choices are staring you in the face. Sangria by the pitcher recommended. I should have ate here more. If you go here first the bar will be set very high for your expectations. 
3034,18-07-2015 ,5.0,"Probably a more touristy place, but it's worth the wait and worth going to. Be sure to pay attention though during the wait as they're not gonna call your name more than a couple of times. Friendly staff and mouth watering food. "
3035,18-07-2015 ,5.0,"Good tapas, nice ambiene and a good variety of tapas. Service is very efficient n prices reasonable."
3036,17-07-2015 ,3.0,"Cerveceria Catalana part of chain and this location is extremely popular so expect to wait for a table. We gave our name and came back after an hour and the table was ready as promised. They will rush you to order but push back and take your time. The grilled cuttlefish, calamari, beef sirloin and pork and red pepper sandwich tapas are delicious. I'd pass on the Greek salad because it had no olives. For dessert I'd recommend their creme brulé absolutely to die for. The atmosphere is chaotic and rushed but comfortable however it's not suitable for an intimate dinner. "
3037,17-07-2015 ,3.0,"The tapas here are great. Service is average, wished they would allow reservation.But the food did impress me so worth the wait."
3038,17-07-2015 ,5.0,"This place is horrifically crowded whether for lunch or dinner but you might get a table sooner than you think because they seem to turn tables quickly and the place is huge inside. The service is the fastest we have seen in Spain -- a level of efficiency that is rarely found in Europe but often found in Chinese restaurants, for better or worse.The tapas is among the best we've had in Barcelona and the price was cheaper than any of the other meals we've had (though we did not order fish, wine, or dessert).Everything we had was really good -- fried peppers, burrata cheese and tomato, asparagus and mushroom, potatoes bravas, croquettes, bacon and cheese on baguette.The restaurant seems to cater mostly to tourists but we had a great meal and decent experience nonetheless."
3039,17-07-2015 ,4.0,"Lively, colourful and delicious food. Great people watching while waiting for a table...locals, tourists, celebrities....food comes quickly....and it's really good!"
3040,16-07-2015 ,5.0,"Yes, it seems that you will have to stand in a near-chaotic crowd for quite some time before your name is called. But take my word, this place is popular for a reason. A good one. Everything works! We tried a good deal of foods on the menu and every plate featured a dish even more delicious than the one before. Everything is so fresh it's hard to put it to words just how fresh. The staff was also super helpful and polite and they spoke properly decent english. Prices are surprisingly low as well; we paid some 60 euros for around ten courses of tapas(-like dishes) and a nice bottle of cava.I recommend you to try:- Small Squid which is a traditional battered calmari ring dish- Boiled cold prawns - Cured ham plate- Chocolate cake with six textures"
3041,16-07-2015 ,4.0,"This restaurant is part of a chain and the Mallorca location is crazy popular with locals and tourists alike. Expect to wait for your table - we waited an hour. Once you get a table the service is lightning fast so we felt rushed to order but push back and take your time deciding. The food is much better than the touristy tapas places on the Ramblas, My favourites include the beef sirloin, pork tenderloin, grilled cuttlefish and a type of creme brule (Catalan style) for dessert. I'd pass on the greek salad - no olives ! Overall I'd recommend this restaurant but not if you want a quiet and relaxed evening."
3042,16-07-2015 ,4.0,"The Cerveceria Catalana is a very popular place, so be prepared to take on the crowd. Tables are allocated on a ""first come, first served"" basis, so get there early or be prepared to queue. The head waiter marshals the chaos with ruthless efficiency and we had our food and drink served promptly. The tapas was all very good. A tip, if you do find a queue, get your name on the Generalissimo's list, get an estimate of the waiting time, then go for a wander. The area around the restaurant is one of the best shopping precincts you will ever find."
3043,15-07-2015 ,4.0,"Didn't know why there was a 1.5 hour wait at 9pm at night on a Sunday so we decided to go early the next day at 11:30am for early lunch and that's where I discovered why there was a wait. The tapas is definitely on point, food is just fresh, tasty, and full of flavour. Service is good with staff checking on you making sure everything ok or if you wanted to order more. Ambience is lovely and just sets off the tone to enjoy food. Definitely worth a try if you're in Barcelona!"
3044,15-07-2015 ,5.0,You want tapas just go here enough said everything on the menu is tasty and if your really hungry and the waiter has told you what you have ordered is enough he's lying just order more trust me. Enjoy 
3045,15-07-2015 ,4.0,"Anyone who visits Barcelona and likes Tapas should experience the Cerveceria Catalana and given the queues outside, everybody knows...Still, this is a great experience and only to be compared with one of these floating Chinese food palaces. One wonders how they manage it but they do. It might take you 20 minutes waiting before you get a seat, but it is worth the wait. The ambiance is busy, but the food comes quickly and you can pick and choose from the menu as often as you like. The food is excellent, these are really great tapas! Will definitely go again on a next occasion."
3046,14-07-2015 ,4.0,"The tapas here were great, maybe the best we had in Barcelona. It's a bit bad that we didn't get the dishes at the same time though but rather potatoes first and then wait 5 minutes for next dish and so on. It was really hectic and you never got the sense you got taken care of but rather that you were on a conveyor belt and all they wanted was for you to get done so the next on the long list could get a table."
3047,14-07-2015 ,4.0,"this place has been legendary for years. they've lost a little of their authenticity over the years due to the droves of tourists, but the food quality and service is high and consistant. i'd recommend trying all the seafood items here."
3048,13-07-2015 ,5.0,Everything was good. You've got to try the pulpo and the gambas.. We also had an amazing sangria de cava. Try to get there early as it is always full of guests. 
3049,13-07-2015 ,5.0,"Great food, and the best place to have a drink and eat tapas. It's worth the time. Go early afternoon in order to avoid the long lines. "
3050,12-07-2015 ,4.0,This is a small restaurant with a lot of charm and great service. The main course was great especially the steaks. The wine was also quite good. Remember to dress smartly for dinner service. 
3051,12-07-2015 ,5.0,A Must in Barcelona!!! The freshest and best tapas in Barcelona! I will be back! Try the fish tapas and the rice of the day.
3052,12-07-2015 ,5.0,"Aaaaaamazing! There seemed to be a long wait when we got there, so we got some beer while we waited. The wait went super fast! Our waiter was very helpful with answering our questions (we're not too fluent in Spanish). The food was incredible. Would go back in a heartbeat. A must-try while in Barcelona!"
3053,12-07-2015 ,4.0,"Open all day (on Sun) unlike many other places. Locals come here - that usually says it all and in this case it did. We wanted casual, Sunday arvo local style. Nothing too fancy, nothing traditional necessarily but definitely Spanish. Tapas/pintxos was fresh, quick to serve and if good flavours. We like seafood - fried fishes and the clams Tapas went down a treat. I had warm crusty cambert - delicious with my red wine. They made a tuna, fresh tomato and onion salad on order for us even though it wasn't on the menu. Special mention to waiter ""Willy"" who manned the outdoor seating area; efficient, proficient English to compensate for our poor Spanish and quite entertaining as he juggled queues of people waiting for al fresco tables. (You don't have to dine outdoors by the way, there are ample indoor seating options at bar or formal dining area if you want to skip the peak hour wait). We arrived at 3, seated at 3:30 al fresco as desired and shared a bottle of wine plus many dishes that reminisced our two week road trip through Spain perfectly. An ideal end/last supper to an ideal mid-winter escape. "
3054,11-07-2015 ,4.0,"Good ambience, the food is very good. Tip: Make reservation because if you don't have one you will have to wait at least 30 to 45 minutes to get a table."
3055,11-07-2015 ,5.0,"Great variety, outstanding service, fun atmosphere, if your looking for a quiet spot..this is not ii was traveling alone, so I truly enjoyed the liveliness. Fresh, fresh, fresh!!"
3056,11-07-2015 ,5.0,"You can't make a reservation, but it's worth waiting for a table.The best thing to do is double dipping without hesitation. Share everything and taste as many things as possible.Talk with the guys across the table, and go back home with an extraordinary experience and with a happy stomach."
3057,10-07-2015 ,5.0,"The cerveceria Catalana is a really great tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The service is good, but it's necessary wait for sit, because there are a lot of people that in high season always visit this cerveceria. I recommend the tapas from eggs, the name is ""cabreaos egg style"", its a traditional dish on the restaurant and the tasty is amazing."
3058,10-07-2015 ,4.0,This tapas restaurant is a meeting place! You can choose from a variety of fresh tapas and other plates.
3059,10-07-2015 ,5.0,"This place has excellent food. The only problem is that it is very busy and so wait times can get a bit out of hand--once you are seated, though, it is delicious and there is excellent service."
3060,10-07-2015 ,4.0,"For first timers, the tapas sampler isn't a bad idea. It comes with the fried small fish (a little too fishy for me), prawns, croquettes, fried peppers, and clams. All were very tasty. Overall, everything was very delicious! Make sure to order some sangria with your meal"
3061,10-07-2015 ,5.0,"AMAZING ! AMAZING ! AMAZING ! Try anything on the menu ...you will be blown away ! They do not accept reservation, however get there before 8.30 and the wait is not to bad. Otherwise could be one hour or more. Very popular restaurant with tourists and locals"
3062,9-07-2015 ,5.0,"One of the best tapas bars ever! If you can sit at the bar at Catalana, that's the most fun. The tapas is so fresh and the service is just terrific. Have a pitcher of Sangria and savor the moments!"
3063,9-07-2015 ,4.0,"This restaurant is very busy, so do expect a long wait for your table. The menu has quite a good variety of tapas, but not many for main dish. Our group enjoyed grilled cuttlefish and white anchovies in vinegar the most. Their razor clams and prawns were excellent too! It's a good dinner place after shopping."
3064,9-07-2015 ,4.0,"Friends gave us the address so we decided to go for what is know as one of the best tapas restaurants in bcn as we had only two days in the city. + : incredibly good tapas (try the iberic plate with pan tomate) and very nice waiters. Service is very quick. We took sangria, very sweet and good! So good we drank 3 litres of it in one hour (we were there as a couple).- : there is waiting time. When you arrive you have to put your name on a logbook and when your time comes someone calls you out loud. Meaning that you have to stay in front of the restaurant. We only waited 15 minutes but our friends waited 30. And last but not least, don't go there if you're looking for the typical little tapas restaurant on the shore. It is a very modern and touristic place, don't expect to eat next to a table of locals.Yet it is very good and is a must!"
3065,9-07-2015 ,4.0,"Great tapas and great value! Lots of different variety and wonderful staff. We visited the night before for dinner and was told to wait for 2 hours. Decided to go back the next day for lunch instead and the place was empty, gave us a table immediately. Service was excellent as they were not busy. Not sure I will say the same for the night meals."
3066,9-07-2015 ,4.0,"It was the last restaurant we visited in Barcelona, and we aimed for the best in Tapas.To be true, their tapas are very good, but not the best in Barcelona. The service outside was better than inside, but a little distant. They assume we have to know what every tapa means, even when they create their own names for it.In the overall, a place that has so many people, that they dont make each client feel special.In our opinion, it's a good place to visit, but considering there are so many other places with good tapas (some even better than this) and with less clients, this restaurant dont deserve the average waiting time for a table."
3067,9-07-2015 ,1.0,"We went there because the restaurant cam recommended so we had high expectations and actually travelled from quite far to get there... however, we were very disappointed - the food was terrible!"
3068,8-07-2015 ,4.0,"Yes this place is crowded and noisy but it's been one of my go-to restaurants for when we want a more modern / waitstaff tapas experience. Push your way gently to the front, put your name down, and kill some time shopping in the nearby neighborhoods or hanging out outside if its nice. Usually their time estimates are accurate, especially during busy periods.Highly recommend getting a pitcher (or 2) of their sangria which is deliciously refreshing and dangerously strong. The waiters will stop by your table somewhat frequently but like most of Spain if you need something you'd be best off signaling to the waiter and asking versus waiting.In terms of food, I'd go for the tapas classics here with a mix in of some of their fresh seafood options. Love the croquetas, served piping hot, the patatas bravas which are on the spicier side and the tortilla espanola. The grilled cuttlefish is definitely one of my favorites here, perfectly cooked and seasoned and delicate in flavor and texture. The pan con tomate is good but not very garlickly. A weird but delicious dish is their fried cheese with jam - its a great mix of sweet and savory.It's pricier than some tapas places but its also nice inside and the waiters will let you linger over your drinks long after you finish your meal."
3069,8-07-2015 ,2.0,"The only thing 4 stars about this place is its real estate. There are far better tapas in Barcelona for much less of a wait and much less money. This place is like the P.F. Chang's of Tapas. The way they manage the crowd here is the worst. They just let hordes of people surround the hostess station, so while it might seem you are waiting in line for the hostess station, you aren't. If you really want to eat here then you must shove your way to the hostess stand, push past the polite people who think there is a line and put your name in with the hostess. This may sound funny, but it's actually how they do it here, trust me.The food was just decent and the service was quick. Nothing was awful, but nothing was that good either. The things I enjoyed, like the jamón, you can literally get anywhere in this city. The calamari was flavorless and the shrimp in garlic oil still had just enough bits of shell on it to add a nice crunch...Avoid the hype of the apparent crowd and go somewhere off the beaten path."
3070,8-07-2015 ,5.0,"Best tapas in Barcelona! They have soooo many tapas, so many options! Their sangria is to die for, and their selection of tapas is undoubtedly delicious. My favorite: Huevos Cabreados. The staff was always very helpful, service was very quick. The wait for dinner was usually long, but definitely worth it."
3071,8-07-2015 ,4.0,"Great food and nice setting, but we felt a bit rushed by the wait staff. Definitely worth going to for the food, but it feels like a bit of a production."
3072,7-07-2015 ,5.0,"We sat at the bar, much better than a table in my opinion. Fabulous food and fabulous service. The bill totaled just over 40 euro which was excellent for a night of food and drink. Staff are amazing and attentive. Can't wait to return"
3073,6-07-2015 ,5.0,"Outstanding food, service is quick and attentive.....but the line is long. Worth the wait, but be prepared to wait. I'll go back in a heartbeat."
3074,6-07-2015 ,4.0,"Despite the crowds we were seated quickly after arriving with a reservation. We enjoyed the fun atmosphere, helpful staff, and the great variety of delicious and well priced dishes. If a noisy restaurant isn't your thing stay away, but if you like a lively environment, go eat and enjoy!"
3075,6-07-2015 ,5.0,"My husband and I love Catalana! The service, the tapas, the atmosphere is top-notch. We tell everyone traveling to Barcelona, 'Catalana is a must!' On our way to Amsterdam we made a special detour to stay 2 nights in BCN, just for Catalana."
3076,5-07-2015 ,4.0,"Came here on a friend's recommendation and enjoyed our first time in a Tapas restaurant. Waiter was reasonably helpful with the menu, but we ordered more based on what we saw others eating around us.We arrived early (6:45) on a Friday, and only waited 5 minutes.Generally a good dinner, but enjoyed better atmosphere at the sister restaurant (Ciudad Condal) later in the week."
3077,5-07-2015 ,4.0,"This restaurant is definitely not a secret. Completely full of tourists, including many Americans we waited an hour for a table. But the atmosphere was excellent and we were able to get a seat at the bar and have a drink and some patatas Bravas - the best we had the whole trip. As its so busy it would be easy for standards to slip or the food be average but it really was excellent. The sangria was a lovely addition and it was a fun meal. The staff were also very patient and friendly and used to the crowds! I would recommend but come expecting a queue and a big crowd of tourists."
3078,5-07-2015 ,4.0,"Of all the tapas bars we went to in our weeks stay this was certainly the best! A wonderful atmosphere with fantastic food for reasonable prices. If possible order as much tapas from the tapas of the day menu, especially the fried aubergine with honey. The only disappointment was how busy it is, the first time we tried to get a table for 2 there was a waiting time of 45 minutes so we had to come back another day. If you don't want to wait get there early!"
3079,4-07-2015 ,4.0,"We came to this place with HIGH expectations- and although the food was good, it didn't meet the hype. First of all, you will be waiting at least 30 minutes to sit regardless of what time you come. It's very busy and full our tourists. The food is tasty, but also pricey. Overall though I would recommend trying it."
3080,4-07-2015 ,5.0,"Very nice bar offerring a variety of drinks and tapas. Located in eixample you can enjoy your drinks in quite atmosphere, in comparison to la rambla, yet a very central area. Value for money for what it offers. If you want to have dinner would need to make a reservation as it is quite busy. Fully reccomended. "
3081,4-07-2015 ,3.0,"This is my third visit to this restaurant. Food was excellent as before. Just a shame that my experience this time was ruined by an extremely rude waiter. I don't speak a word of Spanish but this in fairness is not the waiter's problem. However, I did expect him to be polite at least given that they do a lot of tourist trade."
3082,3-07-2015 ,4.0,"Fast efficient, no frills service and great seafood! Can't go wrong w anything grilled here... especially grilled cuttlefish and navajas!! Fun, casual bustling atmosphere, reminds me of a dim sum joint... There's something for everyone!"
3083,3-07-2015 ,3.0,"This place gets a lot of press and hype. The food was very good, but not the best we are here. Service was better than what most have said. If I have a choice I'm not sure I'd go back. Menu items we enjoyed: Padron peppers, creme Catalan, fried anchovies"
3084,3-07-2015 ,5.0,"Delicious food, friendly and efficient service. Particularly liked the calamarcitos and esparagos and championed. They have baby chairs."
3085,3-07-2015 ,5.0,"We went her on our first night as it was clearly popular by the queue outside. We waited 20 minutes for a table on a Sunday evening at 9pm which seemed reasonable. We were seated and presented with a English and Spanish menu to allow which helped us make the best choices. The drinks were reasonable priced, the draught lager and a bottle of water was 3.20 Euros. The atmosphere was vibrant with locals and tourists, couples, groups and families which really gave it a lovely feel. We ordered Patatas Bravas (cooked to perfection but would have been better for some seasoning, despite the piquet sauce). The fleuts were amazing we had chorizo and jamon, as were the Croquetas - the only disappointment for me was the Calamari Romana which was too chewy/tough. We had two deserts Spanish crème - which takes second place to a good Crème Brulee.The service was quick and efficient and the food was consistently good so we returned.I would recommend if you are not impatient when on holiday and are willing to wait Cerveceria Catalana is worth a visit.Overall spend 30 Euros for 2"
3086,2-07-2015 ,3.0,"Several folks recommended this restaurant so we anxiously tried it out on our first afternoon in Barcelona. The food was good, service was fine, drinks were fine as well. Nothing really stood out, except the razor clams. However, having razor clams twice later, I realized that the clams here were simply not very well prepared. So, overall, I'd recommend looking elsewhere for remarkable tapas. This place is good, just not great. Bit of a tourist spot though if you are a local and regular, you may know something I don't know."
3087,2-07-2015 ,3.0,"I wasn't entirely impressed by this restaurant. It was very crowded and packed with tourists. The tapas were decent, particularly the anchovies and eggplant.The waitstaff wasn't the best, they forgot one of our orders. The patatas bravas was nothing to write home about. The sangria was delicious. But not worth the long wait."
3088,2-07-2015 ,5.0,"This place is awesome, it has a wide variety of tapas from simple to complex. All are A+. The service is great, the waitresses are all very nice. There is a wait to sit but quite short."
3089,2-07-2015 ,4.0,This is a great spot. The food is flawless and the sevice excellent. Only down side is that everybody knows this and it's extremly busy. An hour and a half wait is the norm at peak times.It is worth it though. Reasonably priced too.
3090,2-07-2015 ,2.0,"First, the place is not very good looking, there is no style; second the prices are a bit high for the value, third, the tapas are boring and not all of then are actually good; maybe if it's your first time in Spain, they can be ok, but after some weeks here you can compare and say that the food is not good;"
3091,1-07-2015 ,4.0,"This was our first tapas restaurant during our trip to Spain and overall was very good. It was really crowded at lunch time with apparently mostly local people. Basic, non fancy tapas but all good..."
3092,1-07-2015 ,4.0,"Best tapas I have had so far during the trip! We went on Sunday the first day we arrived Barcelona. Because Sunday most of the restaurant were closed, but they open until midnight. We seated outside nice atmosphere with good service. Only problem was too many people waiting, we went on for lunch the waiting time was acceptable. Their seafood dishes are highly recommended. It was fresh and delicious. There were four of us. We spend about €60. We all left full and happy and very pleased with our meals. "
3093,1-07-2015 ,5.0,"Enjoyed a variety of local dishes between 7 people, and we each paid €23 including drinks. To try: - Boquerones - anchovies in vinegar- pan con tomate- to eat with anything -pimientos de Padrón - green grilled peppers that look like jalapeños but are NOT spicy at all!-patatas bravas- traditional Spanish fried potatoes with a garlic sauce -croquetas de jamón- fried croquettes made with real Spanish ham -beef tenderloin montadito- a delicious piece of tenderloin on bread- fois gras served with Roquefort "
3094,1-07-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent food and service. If you get there after 8pm, expect to wait about 1/2 hour or more, but if you go just before 8pm, no crowds. "
3095,1-07-2015 ,5.0,"At lunch time, you'll probably need to wait a little before a table comes free but it's totally worth waiting. There is unfortunately not much outdoor seating but the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. Every tapas we tried was absolutely stunning. We strongly recommend you the following: prawn screwers, anchovies, Russian salad, pasta salad, patatas bravas, tortillas, Spanish ham croquettes. And don't forget to order their jug of refreshing and delightful sangria!"
3096,30-06-2015 ,1.0,"The food was gross. Was like a big cafeteria. This place had good reviews on multiple sites, but every meal we had, except one even more awful, was better. Dont go."
3097,30-06-2015 ,5.0,Full of people but staff are nice.Tapas are excellent and price reasonable.A must try.Easy to get there after visiting Casa Mila.The hot shrimps are tasty and fresh.
3098,30-06-2015 ,5.0,"We knew then that there are many good tapas restaurants in Barcelona, but this tapas place stood out since it was not only suggested by our hotel's concierge but also featured in Tripadvisor as the tapas place in Barcelona. This place is vibrant, with stream of people crowded the restaurant and the street in front. But since this is a tapa restaurant, the turn over is pretty quick. The tapas selections are vast and delicious. The servers are very active and helpful. Sitting outside looking at people walking by while enjoying the tapas are the best experience one could ask for in Barcelona."
3099,30-06-2015 ,5.0,This place is amazing. Very good service and food. Breakfast was also great.Highly recommended.Not very close to las Ramblas but worth the walk.
3100,30-06-2015 ,5.0,"This is a wonderful place, they don't take reservations so go early, we were a party of fifteen, and they were very accommodating. Be sure to try grilled calamari, and the eggs an potatoes too wonderful, we order a variety of tapas and everything was good. Good local beer,"
3101,30-06-2015 ,5.0,"The tapas in this restaurant is the best I have tasted, and is truly delicious. It is reasonably priced, beautifully presented and incredibly tasty! I recently visited with friends and we chose a number of dishes to share as well as quite a few jugs of sangria! We had a fantastic afternoon and I would highly recommend this restaurant to any friends visiting Barcelona.I am a frequent visitor to Spain and this is the best Tapas I have had."
3102,30-06-2015 ,5.0,Local eatery overflowing with locals. The food was excellent. Some of the best we have had on our month long travels. Prices are great for the quality of food. Will definitely go back.
3103,29-06-2015 ,5.0,"The first time I tried Tapas, and I have no idea before. This meal is the best of I tried in these couple weeks. I really enjoy of it and the place. Here waiter could speak English fluently and nice to customers. My friend had difficult on ordering and the waiter recommended Basque for him. The restaurant has alternative choice of dining place, and outside more causal. It is the place I want to come again."
3104,29-06-2015 ,5.0,The waiter was a little surly to start with but soon warmed up. Great atmosphere in a buzzing environment. Food was excellent with great choice of wines and beers.
3105,29-06-2015 ,5.0,We came by this restaurant when walking around the area.It was a nice looking and big place. When we walked in we saw the different dishes and they looked amazing!The food was very good and not expensive!Also the airco was nice!We will come back to this restaurant and recommend it to friends and family !!!
3106,29-06-2015 ,3.0,"We have been in few restaurants, that one we choose because of review. We did wait an hour to get a table thats ok we knew about cueing. But food nothing ! Special im not saying not tasty, but food that quality you can eat everywhere else. Sangria expensive to what you get. Do not recommend look for something less touristy a"
3107,29-06-2015 ,5.0,"Extraordinary variety of tapa's, all wonderfully cooked and very tasty, excellent service with friendly waiters."
3108,28-06-2015 ,5.0,"This offered quick service, very attentive. Absolutely fantastic small plates. It's crowed, we were so lucky to get in because it was our best meal in Spain!"
3109,28-06-2015 ,5.0,"Good variety of tapas. Need to wait bit worthwhile....options for outside, inside or in bar stools. Enjoyed the barstool experience."
3110,27-06-2015 ,3.0,After hearing so much about this place I decided to give it a go. While the tapas are good there are from far not the best I have eaten. The biggest problem is the ambiance: the restaurant nearly looks like a canteen and the waiters basically throw the food to your table. 
3111,27-06-2015 ,5.0,"We had lunch there and found it to be the best meal we enojyed during our three weeks throughout Spain. The lady who recommended this asked if we liked Basque to which we replied YES so that is why we dined there. Inside, packed with Barcelonians well dressed and upscale. Outside more casual. Lots of Filipino waitstaff who spoke English.The only other meal I considered equal was at FourGats in the old town.If you like Basque cuisine do NOT miss this spot."
3112,27-06-2015 ,5.0,"You may have to wait to get into Catalana but it is definitely worth it. They have a good selection of tapas, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is enjoyable. The staff was helpful explaining the menu options. If you aren't sure where to start try the assorted tapas plate and then branch out. This place is very popular and can get crowded around 8 so you may want to eat earlier."
3113,27-06-2015 ,5.0,"I first came here in 2012 with a few friends after a recommendation, and needless to say 3 years later it's just as delicious!! We had one night in Barcelona this time around and made sure Catalana was on our itinerary. Be sure to arrive by 6pm to avoid a long wait. Fabulous food, atmosphere, waitresses and prices. Defiantly ask for the fried chips and egg as one of your menu choices! A must in Barcelona :)"
3114,26-06-2015 ,5.0,One of the best tapas restaurant of the city.Service personel that speaks english is a huge plus.And all we ate were really delicious
3115,26-06-2015 ,1.0,"After reading fantastic reviews we decided to try this place. Turned up at 8pm and the place was packed, we were told it would be an hours wait so we decided to go elsewhere and come back earlier another day. The food looked good and the fact that the place was packed must be a good sign but we were wrong. Came back mid afternoon the following day and were told they only had a sharing table available as it was still quite busy but we didn't mind. We ordered 4-5 Tapas dishes and they were truly disappointing. Bland, no flavour and the tomato bread didn't even taste of tomato just soggy with olive oil. The worst food we had in Barcelona. Service was also poor my husband beer glass was removed from the table but never was he asked if he wanted another drink. We had Creme Caramel for dessert which was the best part of the meal and was probably brought in from elsewhere. We made a quick exit and this place went down as the worst meal we had on our 6 day Barcelona stay."
3116,26-06-2015 ,5.0,This place was amazing!!!A friend of mine who is local took us here and we were so impressed!They have a large selection of tapa's and have lots of them in a glass display! They all look delicious and as we were with a local we had her order all the food! However you just want to eat all of it! The place is busy and they don't take reservations do we sat at their counter instead.
3117,25-06-2015 ,4.0,"My partner and I went here for dinner. It was very busy but we got a table relatively quickly. The food was delicious but we couldn't read one of the menus because it was in Spanish and when we asked the waiter for advice on what to order, he was not very helpful or forthcoming with information. We thought the food was great but definitely some room for improvement with service. "
3118,25-06-2015 ,5.0,"Be prepared for a wait! It's worth it. We got our names on the list, and then staked out the bar, where we were able to hop into some seats as other patrons were leaving before our name was called for a table. Unsure of what we should order, the bar tender was more than happy to serve us up a variety of tapas and montaditos that were so delicious. One of the montaditos with cheese on it was the best thing I've ever eaten. Although we opted for wine, many people were ordering pitchers of sangria. This place is lively, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious."
3119,25-06-2015 ,5.0,"My family of five went on our first night in Barcelona. We ate til we were stuffed! The reception staff was excellent and worked to get us seated as quickly as possible with a huge crowd waiting. The wait staff was quick efficient and helpful as well. The food was delicious and we can't wait to try the sister restaurants. We had at least 15 choices and all of them were excellent. We had many of the daily specials and a favorite was the fried Camanbert with preserves. Had two rounds of that. The lagastinos and risotto were also favorites. Dessert found us choosing local favorites too. Our bill with a bottle of Cava, some beers, and lots of food was only 130 Euros. This would have been well over $200 in Ohio. I would not miss this place if I was going to be in Barcelona. A perfect start to our trip."
3120,25-06-2015 ,5.0,"After great reviews my partner and I went here for a very late lunch after seeing the Sagrada Familia (about 20 mins walk away) and were not disappointed.Food was great, wine suggestions were great and the price was very reasonable. Would recommend to anyone in Eixample, Barcelona!"
3121,25-06-2015 ,5.0,"I don't think i can fin the words to describe how tasteful it was ! We were two and had a bill that was over 80 euros but we've had it all, beers, and i think mostly every tapas except the salads !!! The shrimps are fantastic, the special recipe of cheese almonds and marmelade is amazing. I recommend that you taste the big olives ! And most of all it is open till late something like 1.30 am which is a must in BCN."
3122,25-06-2015 ,5.0,Everyone already knows this is a great find. Food is excellent with great service and amazing prices. We I'll be back again as will everyone else
3123,25-06-2015 ,4.0,"Great company, tasty food, sangria and Belgium beer - recipe for an unforgettable midnight dinner. This restaurant is ALWAYS busy, especially on weekends. They don't take reservations but you can hangout at the bar with a pitcher of sangria until you get a table. Highly recommend. "
3124,24-06-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent food, so much so that we returned three times over our short stay in Barcelona. Great variety of fresh tapas, my favourites being the grilled cuttlefish and squid, excellent white anchovies as well, good wine list. Staff very friendly, excellent English and a very quick queuing system and finally a very sleek contemporary interior...or street side tables. "
3125,23-06-2015 ,2.0,"The setting is wonderful, but that's all. All the menu is filled with pork products or sea food. Great for some, but not for me. We took the anchovies and dutch sandwiches. Two sandwiches and two tapas are not enough for lunch. We had to get an additional sandwich and another tapas to feel satiated. No warmth and welcoming feeling was detected."
3126,23-06-2015 ,1.0,"Waiting time, stress, noise... Low quality products, no value at all.I don't understand why it's popular."
3127,22-06-2015 ,5.0,"How can I saw enough amazing things about this place? Checked it out based on a recommendation from a friend who use to live in Barcelona. Waited about 45mins but passed the time sipping on delicious sangria. Service was quick. Zucchini was to die for, mini hamburger was super flavorful and beef tenderloin on a baguette was super tender! Everything was done well - best dining experience during our week long trip in Spain!"
3128,22-06-2015 ,5.0,"They have tapas for all tastes, we ordered a few of each and shared as much as possible. I think the signature dish must be the ""huevos cabreados"" which they mix in front of you. Defenitely worth a try! Be careful if you're hungry, can take up to an hour to get a table."
3129,22-06-2015 ,4.0,Its a delicious place to eat. They offer great variety of Tapas and very original combinations. A must when you visit Barcelona
3130,20-06-2015 ,3.0,"I ate dinner at Cerverceria Catalana one night in late May and wish I had selected a different array of tapas. Of the four tapas I ordered, one (grilled asparagus with mushrooms) was tasty; the other three (bread with fried Camembert, croquettes, and a poached egg dish) were OK, but disappointing. This is a very large, very busy restaurant, which may explain why my server was pleasant, but not particularly helpful."
3131,20-06-2015 ,5.0,"waited over an hour for this and would have waited even longer. great service, very fast since it is tapas, but unbelievable food!!! we had the brie cheese sticks with jelly, the patatas bravas, little hamburgers, and so much more. best tapas place we went to in barcelona by far"
3132,19-06-2015 ,5.0,"Came here for a tapas lunch and was not disappointed with a single thing.We ordered fried calamari, grilled mushrooms, and the assorted tapas platter. The grilled mushrooms, as simple as they might sound, were absolutely delicious. The assorted tapas platter was big enough for two people to share and get full from. We didn't need to order the extra two plates. They also give out bread with olive oil and crushed tomatoes spread over. Do NOT opt out from that. The bread is crunchy and holds the tomatoes and olive oil well."
3133,19-06-2015 ,5.0,"The food is top quality with a great variety. There is a mix of tourists, students, parents with college age children and local beautiful people. Expect a wait but you can get a glass of wine and people watch."
3134,19-06-2015 ,5.0,"We arrived at 9pm on a Wednesday and the place was crowded and had an hour wait for a table for 7. Passed the waiting time with Sangria. The tapas, once ordered, arrived rapidly. Highlights were the Solomillo, grilled mushrooms, squid, and the 7-texture chocolate dessert. The tapas were the best of the ones we have tasted in Spain."
3135,19-06-2015 ,5.0,We were recommended this restaurant after doing a food tour by Food Lovers. Our meal was top notch. We were told to go a bit early for Spanish standards and I would recommend this. We only had a 20 min wait at 7pm but when we left the wait was significantly longer and keep in mind that the waiter isn't going to rush their customers meal. Dining is a social event. We tried so many things on the menu I couldn't recommend one over another. Try it all! I promise this restaurant will not disappoint and some staff do speak English. It is a hot spot among the locals.
3136,19-06-2015 ,5.0,"In BCN, This tapas restaurant close to the Rambla de Catalunya is simply amazing. The waiting time to get a table is the best proof of the quality of this thrilling Catalan Restaurant.We tried twice to get a table, Thursday diner 09:00 pm) around 90 minutes to get a table.Friday lunch (02:00 pm) around 15 minutes.The food is great, the prices are crazy.It's mandatory to eat there ! Enjoy ! P."
3137,18-06-2015 ,5.0,"This restaurant is located on a quiet side street Allorga 236 about 20 minutes walk north from the Rambla; but lots of people are willing to line up to get in. The menu has both Spanish and English. All their seafoods are fresh and delicious; service is fast. Make sure to try the squid, calamares and sangria. You won't be disappointed."
3138,18-06-2015 ,5.0,"Word is this is one of the best tapas restaurants in Barcelona. Certainly one of the busiest, with a mix of local, tourists, beautiful people and families. Rather large and extrememly busy, but they seem to maintain top qualitiy of the food and service. We ate their twice in a 5-night stay, not out of boredom but because we wanted our last meal to be reliably good and it was. If you get there past 730-745pm, expect an hour wait. You might get lucky, but that's what it will be. We sat outside once inside the second time. Both were enjoyable. Great sangria to go with the wide variety of tapas choices."
3139,18-06-2015 ,5.0,"This busy tapas restaurant was such a delicious and fun experience, that we went back the next day for more. All the dishes are served on small plates. Drinks include beers, wines, sangria, and Spanish champagne. Even with a 20 minute wait, it was very worth it."
3140,18-06-2015 ,5.0,"Don't believe the guide books that tell you no one in Barcelona eats before 9. This place was nicely busy at 6 and perfect for dinner before an evening at Casa Bottlo. Food is delicious and such a variety, to suit all tastes. The waiter patiently took us through the dishes of the day which were all in Spanish and well worth his effort! Every one was so tasty and fortunately one didn't arrive as our eyes were certainly bigger than our bellies as the portions were generous. A really lovely meal and highly recommended."
3141,17-06-2015 ,5.0,"They don't take reservations here and it's always busy so expect to wait a while for a table. Don't let the huge crowd of people waiting in and outside put you off, get past them and speak to the lady on the small desk and get your name on the waiting list. There are plenty of shops nearby to kill time if the wait is long.The service is brilliant and the dishes the waitress recommended was excellent. The food itself like everyone else is saying is amazing and very tasty. Just wish I was a bigger stomach to eat more dishes. We were able to get through 7 tapas' between me and my husband, didn't have room for desert.Even though the restaurant is so busy we never felt rushed to finish quickly and give the table back to them so they can get new customers in. You can really relax and take your time here. Casual atmosphere and really chilled out. A must visit."
3142,17-06-2015 ,5.0,"Located about a 10 minute walk from Palau de la Musica Catalona, this is a perfect place to come before a theatre show. It's on the pedestrian street Argenteria and very near the Jaume metro stop and the Cathedral. Go early because it gets very crowded. We went about 6: 30 p.m. and were able to get an outside table. You go to the bar to pick out your tapas; in addition, waiters bring trays of hot tapas around to the various tables (think Dim Sum). Everything was delicious--especially the dessert which was tomato jam with cheese."
3143,15-06-2015 ,5.0,"What can you say about this place that hasn´t been said ? It's an amazing restaurant for tapas, probably the best I've ever been. The food is awesome, and the diversity of tapas just blows you away. The worst part is that they don't take reservations so you better get there before the rush hour or you'll have to wait for hours."
3144,14-06-2015 ,5.0,"You must get here early (7pm-ish) to avoid long line-ups. We arrived at 7:45pm and waited about 20 minutes for a table and the bar was already full... but it was SOOOO worth the wait. Every tapas we ordered was cooked to perfection - especially the beef, grilled calamari and ""pescaditos fritos"". Truly fantastic experience, which we plan to repeat before our vacation is over. Don't miss it!!!"
3145,14-06-2015 ,5.0,"You have to try this unbelievable cerveceria just off Las Ramblas and Mallorca. The tapas were prepared perfectly every time, the service was quick, and the prices were the best we saw in Barcelona. Lunch was so good we went back on our last night in Barcelona for dinner. Obviously your taste should guide your tapas choices, but we certainly enjoyed the: beef flautas, the grilled shrimp, the asparagus and mushrooms and the potatoes and aioli. The seafood choices in general were simply indescribable. No doubt you'll find something wonderful to eat!"
3146,12-06-2015 ,5.0,"We tried this restaurant our first night & were told it was a 45 min wait. We were starving so decided to try again the next night. It was about an hour earlier (7pm) so we only waited about 15 mins! We ordered the croquettes, which were the best I've ever had, the garlic prawns, and the beef on bread. The beef on bread was so good we ordered more! We finished with the baked camembert, which is to die for!! To drink we shared a bottle of the Vina Sol, an inexpensive Catalonian wine. As we were only staying 3 nights we wanted to try a selection of restaurants. If we were staying any longer we would have gone back again. A must try!!"
3147,12-06-2015 ,5.0,Had a lovely meal here. There's a real buzz to the place. Make sure you book in advance though as you might have a very long wait for a table.
3148,10-06-2015 ,5.0,"PROS- lovely food, every tapas is delicious- fast and friendly service- pleasant atmosphere, easily accessible location- did I mention amazing food?- price adequate to the qualityCONS- none"
3149,9-06-2015 ,5.0,"Just tried out this restaurant based on the TAs ratings and the proximity to our hotel.We arrived just after 8pm and the place was already packed with people. For a table of 2, we were told 20-30mins wait ... but that only turned out to be 10mins (so don't wander too far away!).There was the regular English menu but also a small Spanish specials ... would recommend taking the time to understand the Spanish one. We had lovely grilled red prawns, razor clams, pear and gorgonzola (very nice) and a grill beef skewer. All great selections, very tasty and brought out with great timing. Would certainly recommend this place."
3150,9-06-2015 ,5.0,"It is a great restaurant a bit further from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla, but totally worth the walk. You might even have to wait for a table when you get there, but order something at the bar and make the time to enjoy their great selection of tapas. Went there twice and it definitely did not disappoint."
3151,8-06-2015 ,5.0,"Great selection of tapas and very friendly staff, a few tables outside and a nice big space inside. Only minor gripe, the 'assorted salads' was various mayo based veg and meat mixes. Great tasting but we actually wanted salad :)"
3152,8-06-2015 ,5.0,"Great food, from tapas to other meals. We got to this restaurant after asking some local people for a good place where to eat tapas. It is not a typical tourists restaurant but a very busy place where locals go for lunch or dinner.Really nice and warm atmosphere both inside and outside. Friendly and efficient service. Price is very reasonable for what you get. I will definitely come back when I'm in Barcelona again."
3153,8-06-2015 ,4.0,"Even if a little unconventional, this restaurant serves high quality tapas. Packed with tourists and locals, the service is fast and precise.Plan ahead, make a call for a table."
3154,8-06-2015 ,5.0,"This restaurant seems unassuming from the outside, and the name doesn't say much. But everything there is excellent. Good service, plenty of choice on the menu, good wine, great atmosphere. Near the Diagonal metro station. Barcelona is a city that can be full of tourist hype. This place is the antidote. I had excellent octopus, sangria, and something on toast that was quite nice. Highly recommended."
3155,7-06-2015 ,5.0,"My husband and I went to this place and from our 4 days of stay there we ate there 3/4 days lunch and dinner. The food is the best, sangria is delish and the waiters are all friendly- the bar tender at night is very friendly and will entertain you well. We usually close the bar:-)) and you will meet plenty of frienty catalonians."
3156,7-06-2015 ,5.0,"excellent restaurant in barcelona for tapas,i had been there 3 times,always sitting at the bar, staff very friendly and the tapas amazing,price ok not expensive best restaurant to tapas in my travel.try tapas -camembert with almonds excellent, and montaditos shrimps with fungi,i recommend eat at the bar if you maximum 2 or 3 persons,if more than 3 ,go to the restaurant."
3157,7-06-2015 ,5.0,"Went there 2 nights in a row. Had the best Baby Squid, Prawn Skewers, Beef Tenderloin, and Anchovies in Vinegar and Olive Oil that all go well with their house Sangria. Also had one of the best chocolate cakes I've tasted. Of note is the service of the Filipina waiter (Raquel?). Her recommendations didn't fail us and we felt like we were taken care of the entire time. During the first night there we left a shopping bag, came back 10mins and the Filipina waiter kept it for us!Would visit over and over again... Just make sure you are willing to wait an hour for a proper table. It's worth the wait (and weight ) though!"
3158,6-06-2015 ,4.0,"We went to this restaurant for lunches for both days of our stay. It is very close to our hotel (Hotel ALMA). We went to the restaurant between 1:20 - 2:00 PM. It was crowded. We had to wait for 15 - 20 minutes for a table. We had some difficulties with the type of food we should order. We told waiter/waitress the type of Tapas we would like to have (like fish, beef or mushroom). The food tasted reasonably good with good price (approx. 40 euro for two with half bottle of white wine for one lunch and half of pitcher of sangria for the other)."
3159,6-06-2015 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a chain of restaurants in Barcelona, it serves local Catalonian food and Tapas, its quite good, everything i we had there was fresh and well cooked, however, it is often quite crowded, and i do recommend reserving a place in advance. "
3160,6-06-2015 ,5.0,"Our Concierge recommended this spot to us as the place where the locals eat. We went back 4 times! Delicious fresh tapas from the traditional to more innovative selections. Catalana is always busy so the fresh food which is always on display was constantly being renewed. From mini croissants with Iberica ham and buffalo mozzarella to baby squid and scallops, prawns and wild mushrooms on sticks, this is a classy tapas joint with outstanding service. Open from 8am until 1am and slightly off the beaten track but close to the Passige de Gracia."
3161,5-06-2015 ,5.0,"Came here for lunch after looking at reviews from TA and lonely planet. Pleasantly surprised to find locals and tourists, a nice mix! Lunch was packed. Busiest from 2-4pm, but took only 15min for a table (you can also sit at the counter for service). Food was delicious and we picked a variety of tapas from the daily menu. We tried the octopus, Bravas, and grilled cuttle fish, as well as the arroz negra all amazing! 0.5l of sangria and 1 beer with 5 dishes ran about 45€. NotBad but seems pricer than other places. Clean restaurant with an efficient staff. Will definitely visit again!"
3162,5-06-2015 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a favorite when we visit Barcelona. This is our 3rd time there and it continues to provide excellent food and delicious Sangria!This time, we arrived a bit too early (while waiting for our hotel room to be ready). Evidently, the 'spread' at the front of the restaurant does not appear until after Noon. And what a spread it is!Part of the fun of eating here is coming in and seeing the amazing food displayed in such a beautiful way. All of the tapas, salads, fish and more are presented like objects d'art and they taste even better than they look!I would highly recommend visiting when you are in Barcelona. It was one of the highlights of the trip for us and our friends, who were visiting for the first time."
3163,5-06-2015 ,5.0,Just love this tapas restaurant. Have been a few times and it never disappoints! Busy but well worth the wait for a table. Enjoy!
3164,4-06-2015 ,5.0,"The place was very crowded as they don't take reservations. 2 of us were told to wait for 15 minutes, but we got a table within 5 minutes! The wide variety of tapas made it hard for us to choose, but the ones we settled on were scrumptious and savoury. Exceptional mention should be made of the garlic prawns which were succulent and firm with a garlicky punch. The deep fried camembert coated with almond was mind-blowing - a mouthful of different textures from the combination of warm soft camembert with the crunchy almond coating and sweet chilli sauce. Would definitely come back here again for another unforgettable experience!"
3165,4-06-2015 ,4.0,"best place for tapas !Place is very crowded and you must ask for a table : it took 45 min to get ours , but it was absolutely worth to wait !It is a modern , quite hightech place , with basic tables and surroundingsFood is great : choose whatever you like on the (huge) menu and you'll not be disappointedGreat , fast and accurate servicePrices a little bit on the high sideDo not miss it !!"
3166,3-06-2015 ,5.0,"we were in barcelona only for a day as one of the stops of our Mediterranean cruise. one of my friends have been here and he took us for lunch. it's d best tapas I've had so far. the selections are endless and everything is delicious especially with their drink called clara. the razor clams are the bomb! the papas bravas are delish! the little peppers, the cuttlefish, the anchovies, the shrimp i mean everything! definitely going back when i come back to barcelona"
3167,3-06-2015 ,5.0,It's the best place in Barcelona for eat and drink. A few years ago we came here every day for breakfast. Last week we eat twice with our children. The staff is very kindly. 
3168,3-06-2015 ,5.0,"This is really a cool place, you can sit at table and have a normal dinner or sit at the bar and having tapas with a beer. You can see all the dishes on the counter and choose the one that you like- and the taste is very good, especially the artichokes and th cheeses..The place is always crowdy but it moves very fast.."
3169,3-06-2015 ,5.0,"A local told us this is the most authentic Tapas restaurant in Barcelona. We arrived on a weeknight at just before 7 PM. The tables outside were full except for one table for four. The inside was already packed. This is very early for a restaurant with a lot of inside tables to be filled, so we knew we were in for a treat. the waiter gave us the table for four and told us we had 1 1/2 hours as he was doing us a favor by giving two people a table for four. We got great service. After I tipped the waiter, even though he had a big line of people waiting for tables, he told me, ""take your time, the table is yours"". Money talks!! Wine and tapas were inexpensive and delicious. We had a bottle of wine and three tapas to share for less than 30 Euros."
3170,3-06-2015 ,5.0,"Conveniently located just 10 minutes on foot from Plaça Catalunya, this really is a great place to eat in Barcelona. Its popularity speaks for itself. At the busiest times, a lot of people can be seen queuing outside waiting for a table, not worried about the time spent waiting because they know that the total experience once seated inside will be the compensation. One very positive feature is that the restaurant is so well managed; from the orderly way the queue is dealt with (no queue dodgers) to being seated when a table becomes available, to the quick service provided by the well-trained staff, despite the fact that the place actually seats a lot of people. As you go in, you pass customers perched on stools on either side of you, enjoying delicious-looking dishes next to huge displays of food on which you can feast your eyes. The menu is varied and the food is of good quality. We enjoy seeing what other diners are having which gives us inspiration when we order our own dishes. Prices are generally reasonable although some individual dishes seem to be on the steep side. After about half a dozen visits there we have never left disappointed."
3171,1-06-2015 ,5.0,"Plate after plate of excellent produce cooked simply. I'm sure we ate 6 different seafoods!! Old world charm, excellent service."
3172,1-06-2015 ,5.0,"This place gets busy with locals so if you don't want to line up, make a reservation or be like us and turn up at 6pm.We ordered the:- grilled cuttlefish (amazing and fresh)- grilled duck with foie gras (delicious and the foie gras melts in your mouth)- grilled pork and peppers on baguette (tasty)- mini hamburger (onions were caramelised perfectly and the burger was seasoned well)- grilled prawn skewers (fresh and mouth watering)After the first round we had to re-order the grilled duck with foie gras twice because it was soooo good!!! Its on the tapas of the day menu so you need to hope its available!We only wish we found this place earlier so we could come back again and try more dishes!! Will definitely be back."
3173,1-06-2015 ,4.0,"After all the rave reviews, we felt compelled to dine at this tapas bar after a visit to the Sagrada Familia on a Saturday morning. It was probably around 1:30 pm when we arrived. The wait time to get a table for 4 was another 30 minutes. The place was jammed packed with people without even standing room between the counters near the entrance. Once seated, the service was fast. As other reviewers mentioned, this place seemed more like a fast food joint than a restaurant. We were new to tapas so a sampler and a few of other items recommended by our server. The food was tasty and enjoyed with a big jug of sangria. For those who enjoy seafood, the shrimp was very fresh, and the calamari and octopus were cooked just perfectly. The only real negative about our experience at the Cervecería Catalana was the service. The day we dined, the staff seemed overtaxed. Maybe it's like that everyday, I'm not sure."
3174,1-06-2015 ,5.0,Food is good and price reasonable. Service is excellent. Only disappointment is the crab meat tapas - not real crab meat but imitation ones.
3175,31-05-2015 ,5.0,"First of all we called for a reservation and they answer that they don't make any...so we ""risked"" our time and went there without a reservation..a bunch of people were there and no free tables.they put us on a list and in about 1 hour we got our table!i can tell you that it worth all the wait and the food was ""high class"".we strongly recommand Cramble eggs or something like that...catalanian specific and the beef on bread was also a good choice.Best Tapas"
3176,31-05-2015 ,4.0,"this place will not disappoint, make sure that you eat here when you are in barcelona.the ambiance is not great but the food makes it up for it."
3177,31-05-2015 ,4.0,This is a great tapas restaurant where many locals gather after work. Very crowded around 8 pm with the after work crowd. The staff is friendly and eating at the tapas bar was easier. Food was outstanding....I would highly recommend it and prices were reasonable.
3178,31-05-2015 ,4.0,"Lovely food at very reasonable prices. Also, convenient for dining early as it's open during the daytime. It was very busy with lots of locals but was still able to find a table without booking."
3179,31-05-2015 ,4.0,"Better have a reservation in this place, walking distance from Casa Batlò, in the very center of sightseeing tours. There's a wide choice of tapas, some of them are really gourmet and excellent! Sangria is not the best, I suggest choosing other beverages (there're plenty of options). Fish plates are also very good and delicate.Suggested!"
3180,30-05-2015 ,5.0,"Went with two other friends while on a Eurotrip. The wait was over an hour, but it was definitely worth it. I ordered a baguette with anchovies, olives, red peppers and tuna. The combination was awesome. I recommend the sangria as well. "
3181,30-05-2015 ,4.0,"Food was good and affordable which probably explains the large crowd at meal times. Restaurant feels touristy with its staff being largely non-locals to cater to different tourists. It's actually a nice restaurant to slowly enjoy your meal but the long queues and quick service makes you uncomfortable if you idle too long after your meal. Still a place I would recommend, just come early!!"
3182,30-05-2015 ,4.0,"This is THE tapas place around Passeig de Gracia, at least it seems like it given the line and big interest. Wait in line or opt for a seat in the bar - which is the place to sit if you ask me. Delicious tapas, well made and nice tastes. The service is so-so, some seems to have left their smiles at home."
3183,29-05-2015 ,5.0,Suggested this to my travel group and brought them to the restaurant as we were shopping around passeig de gracia. Waited for almost 2 hours and started to worry my friends might not be happy and felt disappointed if the food was not up to their expectation. But it turned out to be excellent! All of them liked the tapas very much. Seafoods are all fresh and juicy! Yummy! The chocolate cake is a must try. High recommended.
3184,29-05-2015 ,3.0,"This place had been recommended for us and yes, it was quite good and the food was OK but the overall experience was a bit lacking. Cerveceria? Then what about some decent beers? Most of those on offer are low-end mainstream in their home countries--NOT very interesting. And the staff were condescending -- humoring the foreign tourists with not a hint of any real warmth. Disappointing"
3185,28-05-2015 ,4.0,"Was brought to this Taperia by a friend that lives in Barcelona. It was extremely crowded with lots of locals, which gave me some confidence. The Tapas were fantastic. Lots of choices and everything was fresh. I highly recommend the Croquetttes, seafood, and surprisingly-the Mini Hamburgers. They were fantastic. It is a little flashy, so doesn't feel like your traditional tapas restaurant, but it is definitely worth a visit."
3186,28-05-2015 ,5.0,"we are recommended this restaurant as MUST , we sat on the bar and have amazing cold sangria and CAVA, the food was amazing you must try the fish with the tomatoes sauce..."
3187,28-05-2015 ,4.0,Really good tapas. Pretty long wait but bar is fun and gives you a glimpse of all the food you could order once seated.
3188,28-05-2015 ,5.0,"In Barcelona for 3 nights, ate here 2 nights in a row. Loved the fried green peppers and chicken and ham croquettes. Worth the wait. "
3189,27-05-2015 ,5.0,"excellent tapas! really good food, fast service but really need to reserve a table otherwise you can wait over an hour to find a table!!"
3190,27-05-2015 ,5.0,Best tapas we had in Spain. We waited about 10 minutes and the place was pretty chaotic but it is only because of the demand. The food was incredible. Fried artichokes in particular were delicious. 
3191,26-05-2015 ,5.0,"This place is right around the corner from our hotel, and it was our first stop after our quick flight from Sevilla. It was crowded and we did not want to wait for a table so we grabbed 2 spots at the bar. It was a bit chaotic and very busy during early afternoon. The bartenders were friendly despite our very limited Spanish. They had a wide selection of tapas with high quality ingredients. We especially liked the lagostines (prawns), the jamon iberico (both served on French baguette) as well as a salad of jamon, mushrooms, and asparagus. We enjoyed it so much we went back for a second visit!"
3192,26-05-2015 ,5.0,"we went with a party of 8, arrived at 7pm and was led to the back of the restaurant where there were a number of large tables set up already. our waiter was excellent, asked us a few questions about likes and dislikes and then brought us a fantastic assortment of plates to sample. there was plenty for everyone to eat and not that much left over, so good selections by our waiter. there was a considerable waiting line by the time we left, so i would suggest to go early if you can"
3193,26-05-2015 ,5.0,Turned up for tapas on a Sunday night at 2100. 90 minute waiting time. So came back at 1600 the next day. Only 20 minutes wait. The quality of the food and excellent service explain why this place is in high demand. We were a party of two adults and two children. Everyone agreed these were the best tapas we had ever had. Can't recommend enough. 
3194,26-05-2015 ,5.0,"I had heard about this restaurant and just had to try it. They don't take reservations so you'll have to wait to get a table, an hour is not unusual. But it's worth the wait. Nice, fast service and the food is amazing. Try the Croquetas de pollo con serrano and the Cabreaos Egg Style- sooooo good!"
3195,26-05-2015 ,4.0,"Lovely tapas place that was recommended to us by 3 different people. No bookings, so turn up, queue up, give your name and you will be told how long to wait, (we had 1hour to 1 hr 15 mins), so we went around the corner to another bar to drink as the bar area in Cerveceria is completely packed and hard to order as you have to lean over people eating at the bar. Once we returned (one bottle of Cava later) we were seated immediately.. seating is in three areas, the entrance lobby, the area at the back and the area right around the corner. The area right around the corner is good for groups, the area at the back lacks ambiance and 'feels' like a canteen' and the area at the entrance is busy but has a great atmosphere - so ask for your preferred area!The food was delicious, nothing pretentious here, but good decent tapas well cooked. A nice modern, buzzy tapas bar that is a little bit over hyped, but the food was good, the price was ok and the drinks we fine. Toilets probably a 6 out of 10 and the lighting at the back of the restaurant gave it a canteen feel, these were the only downsides... but nice place.. "
3196,26-05-2015 ,5.0,"Two years have passed since we visited Cerveceria Catalana, and we were only hoping it had not changed. It is still a bustling, lively place that serves excellent tapas. The service - ironically the same server we had two years ago - was quick, polite, helpful - delivering a delightful meal. Our only regret was that we couldn't sample everything we saw on other tables as well as our own meal. We had a special skewer of shrimp and mushrooms, asparagus and mushrooms, patatas bravas, chiperones (baby squid), fried white anchovies, sausage on a baguette and a wonderful tenderloin on toast. Only two of us, so no wonder there was no room for the shrimp skewer or the peppers I saw on the table next to us. Can't wait to go back!"
3197,26-05-2015 ,5.0,"CC was recommended by my cousin's son who studied in Barcelona. We read the reviews about the long wait and decided to try lunch. Even though the restaurant was packed and people waiting, we were seated almost immediately to our delight. Ordering tapas can be complicated because you don't know the portion size and they can vary from generous to small. We were allowed to go to the bar and select our choices and have them brought to our table. We ordered others off the menu. We were like children in a candy store, everything looked appealing. There food displayed on either side of the door so be sure to check out both. We loved everything: black rice (squid ink), anchovies, crab salad, mushrooms and asparagus, Serrano ham and cheese, and mor anchovies. Have a liter of Sangria. For desert a delicious coconut pudding which was actually a flan sitting on a coconut crust! The many foreign languages heard and the general buzz makes this a very exciting and sophisticated dining experience."
3198,25-05-2015 ,5.0,Sit at the bar and point to what you want. Be sure to ask about the tapas of the day. Get there early as it gets crowded.
3199,25-05-2015 ,5.0,"Ate hear four times during our stay. Very crowded even at 1700 but worth the wait. Helpful, friendly staff. Most of them speak English. Reasonably priced. Four tapas to split is enough for a light dinner. I recommend the following: Papas bravas, mushroom risotto, roasted red pepper eggplant and goat cheese torte, and the beef tenderloin baguette."
3200,24-05-2015 ,5.0,Good tapas ..they have daily tapas ..seafood was very nice the bar was amazing ..kind stuff..cerveceria (beer) is a must there..one of the most crowded resturant in barcelona
3201,24-05-2015 ,4.0,Cerveceria catalana is very good place to have dinner. The food is good and the service is fine (in spain generally the service is tuff) I think go with friend is ok 
3202,23-05-2015 ,5.0,We had a late lunch here at 3pm. Place was buzzing and the bar guys are great entertainment. Food was delicious and fresh. We just selected from the cold tapas on display. Wasn't let down. Can see why this place has great reviews! 
3203,22-05-2015 ,5.0,"Grab a drink and settle in for the wait because it's well worth it. Everything is fun and delicious about this place including the location. We had the brie croquette, and tostas with beef and scampi (just to name a few). We do not eat pork and there was still plenty to enjoy. Get the croquette. The waiter was happy to recommend what to order including an amazing chocolate dessert. "
3204,21-05-2015 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a great place, one mingles whether at the tables or the bar. It has a great menu with great diversity and reasonably priced. It is filled with tourist, but it is not a tourist trap, far away form it; it's one of the best selling restaurants in Barcelona. For us service was more than adequate, the food was good, the decoration and the atmosphere was nice, helping us to enjoy the place even more."
3205,21-05-2015 ,5.0,"Buzzing, frenetic tapas at their best. Nothing close in the four days we spent in Barcelona, including two Michelin Starred restaurants we tried during our stay! Wish we'd found it sooner, and not just during this trip, but also the ten times before!"
3206,21-05-2015 ,5.0,"Just returned from Barcelona and visited this place twice in a week it was so good. It's very popular usually with a queue out of the door (and a long the street) but as others have said it is well worth the wait. The venue is very nice, with a bustling, vibrant atmosphere. There is a great selection of great quality tapas available, the staff are welcoming and attentive and happy to offer recommendations on the menu. There is a good selection of drinks and the prices were reasonable. Best to get there early if you don't want to wait too long and avoid the queues. One of my favorite places to eat in the city - I will certainly be back."
3207,21-05-2015 ,5.0,"Great tapas, great sangria, great service. Can't say enough good things about this place. Be sure to get there."
3208,21-05-2015 ,3.0,"I thought the tapas were first rate; however, two wait staff were boorish and hung about for a tip. The one waiter reached cross the table to retrieve a plate thus disrupting my wife's enjoyment of her meal and this happened three times. Why, I do not know. Perhaps racism or just plain boorishness. The staff who brought our change to the table stood there waiting for his tip, but boorishness should not be rewarded. The staff in the kitchen, however, should be rewarded. Although the food was great I would not return because of the lack of professionalism of the wait staff."
3209,21-05-2015 ,4.0,"The food food was absolutely delicious. There were 3 of us and we ordered Tapas to share, and it was perfect. We order 4 tapas ,plus 3 ""montaditos"" and it was more than enough. I would really recommend the patatas bravas and the fried fish ""pescadito frito"" . On the other hand, the service wasn't the best. It was really crowded and you don't really have a server, everyone tries to help, but it doesn't work very well. Also, they won't seat you if someone of your party is missing. I would definitely go back sometime."
3210,20-05-2015 ,5.0,"My friends living in Barcelona brought me here and I absolutely loved the tapas. The food was amazing, the atmosphere great. I will always return here when in Barcelona!I have been here in March 2012 and still dream of the tapas I have had there!"
3211,20-05-2015 ,5.0,"So very many places for tapas, this place had a line and 30 min. Wait 2 days in a row. Obviously, the place to go. So fresh , so good don't miss this place. It's well worth the wait."
3212,20-05-2015 ,4.0,"Authentic fresh buzzing tapas restaurant worth the hour long wait you might experience at times. Families, locals, couples...everyone is there whether at the bar to witness a ballet of freshly prepare cornucopia. A must"
3213,19-05-2015 ,4.0,"Fresh food, good quality at very reasonable price. Better go before 08:00 PM as usually is overcrowded."
3214,18-05-2015 ,4.0,"This place is always full, if You are starving the bad new is you'll wait around 30 or 40 minutes, good new is You can wait and/or order in the bar.For me the bar is the best choice, because when You are not familiar with ""tapas"" You can see in the bar all the choices and select the ones that You want to try."
3215,18-05-2015 ,4.0,"Big busy tapas restaurant and when you arrive, you sign up and then they tell you when your table is ready. They have also outside tables and as we liked a table outside, we got it in 10 minutes or so. The service was excellent, friendly, efficient and the food is traditionell and they have daily specials. Fast and fun and perfect for our lunch before a 20 minutes walk to La Sagrada Familia on the same street."
3216,18-05-2015 ,3.0,"My 4th time here during 10 years. The place has become very well known. Lots of tourists. Waiting time 30 minutes for our lunch.Good food, however the gambas was too big and not as tasty as we have become used to.I think you'll find better tapas/€ in other places.Note - the restaurant is still very good."
3217,17-05-2015 ,5.0,Nice restaurant next to the rambla. It seems really busy but the dervice is teally fast and good. There is a really good choise of tapas and drinks. The price is ok.
3218,17-05-2015 ,4.0,"This popular tapas bar is always full it seems, but we did not have to wait for more than 20 minutes for a table. The tapas of today is only written in Catalan, so if you don't speak the language, just pick some and hope for the best. You will not be disappointed whatever you pick. The seafood tapas are all exciting, but might not be for everyone. The fried artichokes and fried green peppers were really tasty. The service was efficient, but could have been executed with more smiles from our waiter. "
3219,17-05-2015 ,5.0,We had been recommended this restaurant by our hotel staff. It was excellent - staff were very attentive and the food was outstanding.We did have to wait (10 - 15 minutes) but it was worth it. Food was fresh and tasty - in fact we had seconds on a couple of things they were so good.
3220,17-05-2015 ,5.0,"The restaurant was packed when we arrived, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. The tapas arrived quickly and were delicious. Don't be put off by how busy it is, Cerveceria Catalana is as good as the reviews say."
3221,17-05-2015 ,5.0,"We had our first Barcelona meal at this restaurant - unaware it would be the best place we went. We went four days in a row. one night waited 1.5 hours for table - went to another restaurant for appetiser while we waited. completely worth the wait. Serving staff was great. Every single dish was outstanding. The eggs over fried potatoes A+. The beef tenderloin baguette was delicious. I ordered that all four times we went to the restaurant. You can go in any attire. Very busy and packed starting around 6:30pm. One night we weren´t seated until around 10:15. Again, worth it. Oh, my. So delicious."
3222,14-05-2015 ,3.0,"My visit didn't quite match up to what everyone else is raving about. The place was packed, and I was told that I'd have to wait for 30-minutes, but got my table within 10-minutes, which was good. The food however wasn't on par with the service. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it was amazing. It was decent. I heard about Cerveceria Catalana from friends and read reviews on TripAdvisor. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, but I definitly had better tasting food in other restaurants during my trip to Barcelona."
3223,14-05-2015 ,4.0,"I had reservations at another restaurant which was going to be farther away than I wanted, so our hotel reception suggested three other places, saying this was his fav. So, we went. The restaurant is very popular and therefore we had to wait for a table. They have inside and outside dining. 30 minute or so wait and we were dining inside. The waiter and assistant were very helpful with the menu. We had different dishes that suited our fancy, but dessert was truly great. It was listed as a coconut pudding. We got one for the three of us---wonderful!"
3224,13-05-2015 ,5.0,"This clean, trendy tapas and beer restaurant was recommended by our apartment rental agent, and rightly so. The menu has a good variety of tapas, salads, and sandwiches (flautas) and many different beers, wines, etc. The prices and service are excellent. Go before 7:30 to be guaranteed a table. "
3225,12-05-2015 ,5.0,Amazing popular tapas restaurant. After trying out we know why .. very yummy tapas. We went TWICE to this restaurant ... first time LONG QUEUE causing us to give up and second time before lunch time and we then managed to get a seat.NOTE: the restaurant works with a list of TAPAS of the day .. MY TIP: these tapas of the day are on the bar bench as well so that it is much easier to pick the tapas from the bar bench (since you can see what you will order) rather than picking from the list only.
3226,12-05-2015 ,5.0,"Pretty packed, was recommended by our hotel so we weren't too hopeful but it was gorgeous food and wine. The best place we found in 6 day trip so came back for Huevos Cabreos on last day. Yum"
3227,11-05-2015 ,5.0,"Fresh food, lots of variety, friendly staff, good prices. Arrive early or you will have to wait at this tapas bar which is very popular with the locals. "
3228,11-05-2015 ,4.0,"Excelent tapas and one of the best places in barcelona to have a tapas lunch. Good tapas, huge variety, fresh food and quick to serve. The counter is the best part. Good price-quality relation."
3229,11-05-2015 ,5.0,"We've visited the place three times on our visit :) It is just amazing, and as all good places can be overpopulated ! "
3230,10-05-2015 ,4.0,"You have to go in the market to see alla these amazing frouts, nuts, meeat and fish that they have for sales and also taste in some corners the foods that they surve either to go or in the restaurants"
3231,10-05-2015 ,5.0,Went here for lunch and ate outside. Fabulous tapas. We had sliced fried artichokes that were incredible. I am definitely going to try to do them at home. The lines are a testimony to how good the food is.
3232,8-05-2015 ,5.0,"Just like the other reviews, you will give your name to the very competent hostess and wait 15 to 30 min for a table depending on your party's size. Now I hate to wait but we are on vacation so I am more tolerant and I can only say it was absolutely worth it. The place is crazy busy but very efficient and well run. All staff know what they should be doing. The restaurant inside is huge so don't be deterred. We had the mini burgers, fried calamari, artichokes and asparagus and mushrooms. The waiter knows some English n can help with your choices. We had room for an awesome chocolate cake which was a special of the day so don't miss it."
3233,8-05-2015 ,5.0,"We loved the food - great Tapas and great green salad. The Sangeria was great and It's a great place to eat !!! The staff is great and speaks English, you see the tapas and see what you get before!Highly recommended!"
3234,7-05-2015 ,5.0,"We've visited here for honeymoon in 2011, and it was just amazing.Food, people, wine... everything.If you are looking for a restaurant which is the most popular in Barcelona for people live in Barcelona, It's definetely here. You won't regret."
3235,7-05-2015 ,5.0,"The best tapas I've ever tasted!I was lucky enough to stumble on this place as its just around the corner of our hotel on the first day we arrived in Barcelona. At 2pm we got in it was over crowded, packed with hungry customers and after waiting in the queue to put our name down the waiting list, we continued to wait for another 45 mins before we can sit down. We were starving but was all worth the wait.The food was memorably delicious. I almost could not fault any of these dishes (I do not comment this way often). And on top of that the service was very efficient, our eating plates got replaced with fresh ones frequently every time new dishes served. The bills could not be more reasonably priced, this real good value for money is such a bonus! I was told that the restaurant open daily from 9am to 1:30am which is clearly not a surprise given the huge demand!After having our next meals in a couple of other places we appreciated it even more that Catalana must be one of the best tapas places in town. We came back for a second meal there within our three day trip in Barcelona. I would definitely return to this place the next time I'm in Barcelona because there are at least two other dishes that I'd like to try that I had not: baby squid (not available on Monday) and paella (they ran out at mid day about 4pm when I tried to order)."
3236,7-05-2015 ,5.0,"With good tapas on every city block, the people of Barcelona have many options. But there are a number of restaurants that stand out enough to be packed at all hours. Such is Cerveceria Catalana. We went there on the recommendation of a native Barcelonina, who claimed that this place had the ""best tapas in the entire world!"" I can't substantiate that claim, having only been to several of many, many thousands in Spain. But it was outstanding.We were lucky to get two seats before the crowd began to assemble out on the sidewalk. When a stool would vacate, there were six people who wanted it.I can't begin to describe the amazing assortment of tapas offered here. Take my word for it: there is anything you could want, and much that you didn't know you wanted! The left bar is primarily seafood, while the right bar is everything else. But the waiters yell across the bar when a customer wants something from the other location.Everything we had was great. 5 star recommendation!"
3237,7-05-2015 ,5.0,"This restaurant is a lovely place with amazing tapas!On speaking to our hotel they recommended this restaurant as we wanted traditional tapas with a place to sit and enjoy.We knew that this was a popular place to eat so we made sure we got there early, 5:30pm - ish on a Sunday, the restaurant and bar area was very busy but we still managed to get a nice little table with no waiting. The staff were very helpful, friendly and attentive! We ordered a few tapas, like Spanish omelette which I loved, calamari which was lovely and fresh, razor clams which were cooked perfectly, potato bravas which was the best I had tasted, and many more! The sangria was lovely although I kept dropping the metal stirrer- Which the waiters saw the funny side which made me feel slightly less red faced!The waiters although attentive did not hound you to order which created a very relaxed atmosphere, even though the restaurant was very busy and queues forming outside!For all that we ate and drank the bill was very reasonably priced and I would defiantly recommend this restaurant for its amazing food, lovely staff and charming atmosphere."
3238,7-05-2015 ,4.0,"Large selection - tastes like tapas should taste. Big room, lots of different kind of tapas accommodating, central and good value for money."
3239,6-05-2015 ,5.0,"No, I don't like crowded places... No, I don't like a long wait to get a table... No, never cared for restaurants that are being hyped by everyone... But this is definitly the EXCEPTION ! Tapas to die for and more than worth the wait !!"
3240,6-05-2015 ,4.0,"Paid a visit on may 5, 2015. Varieties of tapas to chooae from. As a first timer to spain and haven't tried tapas before, I opted for an assorted tapas. Five types in a huge plate. 15 + euros. Can be shared by 2 ppl. But a big eater can finish up the whole plate.I would suggest to pick single plates of tapas. Bigger portion and more satisfied. A cup of thick and delicious hot choc only cost slightly less than 3 euros. A reasonable price yummy meal with 18-20 euros per person"
3241,6-05-2015 ,5.0,"Wow first time in proper tapas bar. Only went looking for this place as a friend we bumped in to in airport told us to go there! Thank god he did , such beautiful food! All the atmosphere of a buzzing tapas bar with Spanish and all other nationalities too. Was tempted to have lunch and go back for dinner too just to try all the other bits i didn't have enough room for . We loved it. You will too if you love seafood and fish especially although plenty of meat too and veggie options."
3242,6-05-2015 ,5.0,This was our first Tapas experience in Barcelona! And it turned out great. We had a got a tip to sit at the bar and it was so much fun talking to other people while drinking Sangria and eating Tapas. Our bartender was great too! The queues can get really long.
3243,5-05-2015 ,5.0,"It´s not possible to book, so you need to show up and get a time from the friendly, but so strict lady running the tables.We were five hungry guys and we ordered a lot of different dishes both to share and to our selves. You don´t have to order everything at one time. Start with a few dishes and then add on more later. This makes the meal very exciting and able you to taste a lot of different flavours.I think all 15 dishes we had on the table could be rated as superb. Our waiter was beyond superb as he guided us through our evening with knowledge and humour.An absolute recommendation when visiting Barcelona!"
3244,5-05-2015 ,3.0,"Had lunch here. Service was fast, polite and helpful. Made a selection of ""today's tapas"" as well as their patata bravas. The food was mediocre, not worthy the ratings on TripAdvisor. Atmosphere inside is not at all cozy or charming unless you are seated by the bar/kitchen and watch the chefs prepare the food, or outside. So our rating is possibly based on bad luck, we were seated inside in a noisy area away from the charming sights of the chefs. The selection chosen for us was as mentioned mediocre food at best. "
3245,5-05-2015 ,5.0,"Sit at the counter, it's faster! The food was excellent...had shrimp on skewers, clams, veggies asparagus with mushrooms & a huge salad. Bartender played waiter too and was a really friendly nice guy besides doing an excellent job. Great place...go early "
3246,4-05-2015 ,1.0,"The plastic menu in full English should have been a complete give away. Not to quote an English larger advert but probably the worst tapas experience ever and I'm including the UK in that! The calamari was like chewing on an old tyre and the chipsticks with a couple of fried eggs on top that this place is famous r for would only be suitable as a hangover cure, not authentic tapas. If you want to try somewhere contemporary and amazing, try Napa! This place was akin to IKEA meatballs and not in a good way, avoid at all cost!"
3247,4-05-2015 ,3.0,"Very good food, spanish & generally and very comfort place.A lot of different dishes traditional and mediterranean.The service was very good."
3248,3-05-2015 ,5.0,"The best restaurant with tapas in Barcelona in my humble opinion. Almost everything there is delicious (well, maybe except for frankfurter sausage, because it doesn't quite taste as a sausage). However both the food and the staff is gorgeous. They're nice and helpful. Bear in mind though that this is a crowded place, so it might be hard to find a place there after 7:30-8 p.m. But if you decide to wait you will experience one of the best tapas in Barcelona."
3249,3-05-2015 ,5.0,Loved everything tapas we tried there! The service is quick but make sure to avoid rush hours as it is a very busy place! The sangria is to die for! Highly recommended!
3250,30-04-2015 ,5.0,"There are many choice of tapas which are very very delicious from traditional spanish omelet to grilled fresh sea bass and shrimp, etc. of mediterranean sea. The service and food delivery have agility and fast.It's become very popular to make long queue at the time of dinner, early coming is strongly recommended"
3251,30-04-2015 ,3.0,"We really wanted to try la Cerveceria catalana as we read excellent reports in reviews and numerous taxi drivers and bar owners in Barcelona advised us to try it! We tried it one evening and the waiting was 2 hours. The place was packed with locals, the food that came out looked fantastic. We couldn't reserve for the next evening, they don't take reservations, they recommended another place run by the same owner, two blocks away,but we had the same problem, place was full!"
3252,29-04-2015 ,5.0,"This is a great place. It is clean, friendly and delicious. Try the seafood salad (crab) - one of the tapas on bread- it's awesome! Everything we tried here was good. Patatas bravas, croquets, jamon. I think you really can't go wrong here. Cava is delicious with any of the tapas. My Barcelona tip is to visit La Sagrada familia at the 6:15 PM session. Buy tickets in advance to skip the lines, then hit up Cerveceria Catalana for dinner. Your tired feet and hungry belly will thank you! Also don't miss the sister restaurant Ciudad Contal- it is also a great tapas place with fantastic atmosphere!"
3253,28-04-2015 ,5.0,"Lots of people every day and every night, in spite of the reservations you always have to wait, but excellent tapas, very good service"
3254,28-04-2015 ,4.0,"I could agree that this place gets stacked by tourists but the food is good and cheap while the place maintains a semi-posh ambiance. But the place is BUSY! Always! Even at midnight. Yes, at midnight!!! The average wait-time is 30-45 minutes. The restaurant closes at 1:30 am. Since the residents of this city are late-eaters mostly, getting a table at 7 pm is much easier than 11 pm or later. The service is fast. The servers peak great English and are very friendly and helpful. The prices are very reasonable. they have a very extensive menu of tapas dishes and small plates. A nice bottle of cava costs you only 13-15 euros. But I have to say that the food is not unique to them and they serve dishes that you can exactly get at other tapas restaurants but it definitely gets the job done. My one and only concern was the fact that the prawns they serve in shell are not de-vained but then a lot of places in the city serve the shrimp that way."
3255,28-04-2015 ,5.0,"Really popular place and you realize why when you get the awesome tapas on your taste buds. Very very good food, great place and really crowded. You can't make reservations so be there in time and stand in line, enjoy some Spanish brews while waiting!"
3256,28-04-2015 ,4.0,"This restaurant was recomended by a local. It turned out there was a wait to get a table and we put our names on the list since we had no reservation. 45 minutes later after exploring the area we came back and the table was ready. It soon turned out that it had been worth the wait. A friendly and very professional waiter took our orders for food and wine, also providing good advice. We found the food and service to be excellent. Well worth a visit but you may find it useful to make a reservation beforhand. "
3257,28-04-2015 ,4.0,Suggested by the concierge as it was close to Olivia Balmes Hotel. Food did not disappoint. Portions was above average and service was prompt.
3258,27-04-2015 ,5.0,Great and crowdy atmosphere and amazing tapas. The service is quick but expect to wait a moment before getting your table. Anyway it worths waiting and dont miss the Huevos Cabreaos
3259,26-04-2015 ,2.0,"Out waiter was not all that welcoming. He seemed only interested in turning the table as quickly as possible. Don't bother with this place, it's not all that great."
3260,26-04-2015 ,1.0,I do not understand all this good reviews that this restaurant has.. the place looks really good but...we ordered a mix of tapas for 3 people and they brought us 10 of them. I am sorry but it was the worst food that we ate in Barcelona and the quality was really bad!it was also extremely expensive(75 euro for 10 tapas and 3 beers)!! Also this Tapas-mix was not on the menu and we've been said that we'll pay 20 p.p. and in the end we had to pay 5 euro more for the total price! I wouldn't recommend it at all!
3261,26-04-2015 ,5.0,"We stayed above this amazing restaurant and boy was it hard to get a table here. The food looks amazing and the queues are so long. So we managed to get brunch in here on our last day. The food was amazing, staff lovely and would have loved to sample a lot more of their delicious food. If you want to go I would either go first thing in the morning or late lunch time. You may have to sacrifice and sit inside though. It is also a good value for money"
3262,26-04-2015 ,4.0,Fantastic tapas in a WIDE selection! The worst thing with this place is that you have to choose and it's not an easy task... The rest is just fantastic!
3263,25-04-2015 ,5.0,It is a great place to eat. Even without reservation we never waited for more than 20 minutes. Just the 
3264,25-04-2015 ,5.0,"You need to see to believe the atmosphere in this huge and popular Tapas bar. The food is just outstanding and the choice endless. After a whole evening of eatig, drinking, people watching and conversation you are exhausted but happy and your vallet is nearly as filled as it was before you arrived. A real stael for the quality they offer and the service in mids of the madhouse is always courteous and profesional. When you come early enough and the weather is good yo can even sit outside....This is my favorite place in Barcelona and this since years..."
3265,24-04-2015 ,5.0,"Good place to have tapas with a group. THe food is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy. There might be better places for better tapas, but here the food is still excellend and it has enough space for a group compared to small tapas restaurants that you have to eat standing."
3266,23-04-2015 ,5.0,Do not visit this place if you are on a tight frame because you are bound to encounter long queues. If however you are not in a hurry then this is the place for you to experience the true Barcelona experience.
3267,23-04-2015 ,3.0,"This restaurant got lots of good reviews but cant really say that we enjoyed it. It feels like a fast food restaurant and the tapas isn't that good, we had better at any other restaurant and the prices are a bit expensive for what you are getting."
3268,22-04-2015 ,4.0,"I love sitting at the counter, having great tapas and chatting with the fellow diners. The clams are fantastic."
3269,21-04-2015 ,5.0,"We ate in many tapas restaurants but Cerveseria Catalan was by far the best,every bite was month watering, I especially loved the artichokes they melted in your month.The restaurant was backed at 2PM for lunch, but we were able to get in with a reservationbut my recommendation is to make one. The place has a clean modern look, very trendyamazing location, excellent service and wonderful good. What more can you ask."
3270,21-04-2015 ,2.0,"Cerverceria Catalana is a large, modern tapas restaurant rather than a bar. We took a table outside and street noise was bad (our mistake, not theirs) but the waiter was rude and the food very mediocre."
3271,20-04-2015 ,5.0,"This place was recommended to us and then as definitely worth a trip! Or two! The variety and quality of tapas was excellent. Great tortilla espanol, amazing steak sandwiches, croquettes, deserts... It has something for everyone. We found it quite reasonable too. On the first day we say at the counter, great if you want to see what you're ordering but perhaps not at relaxing as a table. Each to their own..."
3272,20-04-2015 ,5.0,We have returned to Barcelona after two years and the first place we went to was Cervecería Catalana. As usual we waited 20 minutes for dinner as they do not take reservations but it is well worth it. The food selection is tremendous and the prices are very reasonable. The hotel we stayed at recommended it to us and it is well known for its food and service. We tried other places around Eixample but none compare to this place. It's worth the wait to get in. 
3273,20-04-2015 ,4.0,"They don't take reservations which made it difficult when our group of 25 turned up for lunch. However, they got us seated and fed. Good value food and drink. Really nice food."
3274,19-04-2015 ,5.0,"The best tapas I had in Barcelona. Great selection, all very fresh and tasty. The service was very good, the space is nice. Definitely worths the visit. "
3275,19-04-2015 ,4.0,Went with family of four on a Saturday night around 8. Had a 30 min wait. Wait staff was very busy and they clearly were motivated to turn the tables over. Tapas were mostly pretty good but we had one dish that was burned and tasted awful (but still made it on our bill). The Jamon and calamari were great. Total bill with drinks came out to ~€50 which wasn't bad at all. Recommended. 
3276,19-04-2015 ,5.0,"I have been in this place for lunch.Tapas were amazing, I actually got drunk of sangria!!I really liked the long the long shells, and the artichokes.I hope to go back there soon"
3277,19-04-2015 ,5.0,"The best tapas restaurant i've ever experienced. Every time we're in town we dine here, and it's definitely worth the queue. The huevos rancheros are amazing, and the white sangria will help you enjoy an unforgettable time."
3278,19-04-2015 ,4.0,"We tried many different dishes, and they were all properly cooked and tasty. Though it is a very busy place, the service was fast and friendly. Very good value for money."
3279,18-04-2015 ,5.0,"We are in Barcelona and have to eat Tapas. Where to go? Our hotel recommended this restaurant and we had a great time. We were a 3 generation family group with different tastes but with the guidance of the excellent, friendly waiter we all enjoyed our food. The atmosphere is lively and there is actually more room inside than would appear to be the case from the pavement. It does get busy so if you don't like waiting try to go early.I would definitely go back."
3280,18-04-2015 ,5.0,"These tapas were delicious and beautifully presented. Often tapas bars have their food presented in dishes behind the bar and the servers scoop them out to serve the customers. But these seem to be made fresh for each order. I especially recommend the Crispy Camembert!If you're a large group (we were 7), they'll warn you that you only get 2 hours to order, eat and leave. We never expected to take that long but we just made it out in time! (They only have two large tables and need to be able to accommodate other large parties waiting. )"
3281,18-04-2015 ,4.0,Went after a recomendation of freinds...had to wait 45 monutes outside not too bad with nice hot sangaria wine...the atmosphere is very nice and interesting tastes.highly recomended
3282,17-04-2015 ,3.0,"Arrived with my husband. Went there for three nights trying to get in. Loud,engaging,obviously very popular and oh my,they are in love with themselves. We sat down , ordered a full bottle of wine and Tapas. The food was good but they were very unhappy with us. Apparently one does not do that, order the full bottle that is. Our first waiter disappeared and the second one was on the scene and picked up the now half bottle of wine, glanced at us, no smile,let it hit the table in lead brick style and walked. Said nothing and made no eye contact. Perchance might we tarry too long? Also the English menu was missing some tasty tidbits. We ordered the fresh clams (not on the menu) only because the couple at the adjoining table were really enjoying them. The price of the bottle of wine and five tapas was 50 Euro. Not inclined to return."
3283,17-04-2015 ,5.0,"What a fun, fun place. GREAT tapas, fun atmosphere, busy, busy, busy, we went 3 nights and the food was equally as good every night. Great place."
3284,17-04-2015 ,5.0,I visited this tapas bar a year ago and still remember every scent and taste of it... Atmosphere was amazing and the service also very good! We tried every little piece of magic food they serve and drink lot of beer:) hope to be there soon again!
3285,17-04-2015 ,5.0,"recommended! don't miss it, . ...crowded with tourists but very nice for a drink and tapas any time of the day.."
3286,17-04-2015 ,5.0,"If this restaurant didn't invent Tapas they definitely perfected it. We couldn't stay away... 2 visits in four days... Washed down with best Sangria and we had Sangria everywhere this was the best.. From calamari, anchovies, asparagus and mushrooms each one out did the next... A Gaudi of food.. In other words a master. A must.!! "
3287,15-04-2015 ,5.0,This place was recommended by our hotel. It was really good. The food was great they had a good selection of wines and beer. We went back for breakfast which was very good .
3288,14-04-2015 ,5.0,"Love love love. If you like tapas, leisurely eating, a relaxed atmosphere, good wine and great service...ten you must try this place. The squid is to die for - probably the most tender i have ever had! The fried artichoke is divine along with small fried fishes and potatoes with aioli and chilli sauce. Delicious!!!!"
3289,13-04-2015 ,5.0,"There is no shortage of choices of places to eat in Barcelona, and looking for a place to eat good, reliable tapas can be quite a challenge. So many places seem to have questionable quality, or unclear prices, so it was hard to know where to take our business so we could guarantee a good meal that wouldn't cost the earth. We happened to be staying just round the corner from Cerveceria Catalana, and having seen some good reviews, decided to check it out. It is a busy place!! But don't let that put you off. We arrived early(ish) for dinner - about 19.30 - and only had to wait about 15 mins for a table. But by the time we were seated the place was heaving. The bar was full and people were being told it would be 45 mins to an hour before they could get a table. So my advice - go early! Many of the dishes were €3-5 and we ate really well! We had about 7 dishes between two of us, which was plenty, with beer and 1/2 bottle of wine and it came to about €37. We went back for lunch a few days later and ate for about €30. Everything we ate was beautiful and fresh: Fried green peppers with salt, prawn skewers, montaditos with jamon, marinated artichokes, patatas bravas, white anchovies, pan con tomate, asparagus and mushrooms, vegetables with goat's cheese... The only thing I found a little odd was the crispy camembert - served with raspberry jam! Many of the dishes can be ordered in half portions, which is helpful if you want to try a wider range of dishes, or if you're dining with someone who doesn't share the same tastes. And since the dishes come as and when they're ready, you're welcome to order more dishes as the meal progresses (and as you get food envy from spotting something they're eating on the table next to you!) In short, I would highly recommend Cerveceria Catalana!"
3290,13-04-2015 ,5.0,"We have visited Barcelona a few times now and always make sure we call in for some true authentic catalan tapas which is served with a great chilled beer or glass of wine. This place gets packed so prepare for a wait or get there early. Good value, great staff cant wait to go back......"
3291,13-04-2015 ,5.0,"Arrived here after a tip, and was very thankful we took the tip. This was our favourite dining experience in Barcelona during our visit. Great food all up, delicately prepared. Great atmosphere and friendly staff help too. Thanks!"
3292,13-04-2015 ,4.0,"We chose to go to this restaurant due to its high reputation. Reservations are not possible. When we arrived, we registered at the entrance and they told us that we would have to wait up to 45 minutes. In the end, we were only waiting for 30 minutes. It is only a pity, that there is nowhere you can sit down and wait, but stand there squeezed between the crowd of other people waiting. But it is definitely worth it! The tapas they serve compensate all the drawbacks mentioned before! We had the classic tapas and some extras as well. All were very good. The service is friendly and efficient. I can only highly recommend this restaurant. For sure, I will go there again when I am back in Barcelona. If there were half points, I would give a 4.5 for this category of restaurants."
3293,12-04-2015 ,4.0,nice place. a bit crowed and the not very polite service....but the huevos cabreados were amazing....
3294,12-04-2015 ,4.0,"We went twice while we were in Barcelona. Once for dinner and then again the next day for lunch, since we enjoyed our dinner so much the night before! We sat at one of the bar areas for dinner. Food was fresh, delicous and came out very quickly! There was a really good selection of tapas and desserts to choose from. The next day we were able to sit outside for lunch! Again, wonderful food! And sitting outside was delightful! Always a long wait.... be prepared...but worth it!!"
3295,11-04-2015 ,1.0,"Went to this restaurant as part of a business dinner. The food itself was not bad, but the service and atmosphere was horrible. We were a party of 30 , which yes I know is big, but apparently we were too big to be bothered with. From the moment we walked in, we were given attitude about the size of our party and where we could and could not sit. Carlos the main waiter was rude, throwing plates on the table and telling us we could only sit for two hours and then had to leave. Sure enough,, when two hours passed he was pushing us out the door. There are soo many restaurants in Barcelona that serve just as good if not better food. Go there instead. "
3296,11-04-2015 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana exits for some 20 something years. Well before the Tapas eating was spread all over the world, la Catalana has been serving locals with the best Tapas in Barcelone. Not the Gourmet Tapas, not the Fusion Tapas, just plain Spanish real Tapas.If you are looking for that, go there, but avoid peak hours, as the waiting time could be more than one hour. And, note, the draught beer is just PERFECT ( they also have wine ). You will spend 100 euros a couple ( max) and will be wanting to come back the following day !"
3297,11-04-2015 ,5.0,"We received two tips to eat here, so we had high expectations. We were not disappointed! Less than a block from our hotel, we ended up having dinner at Cervecaria Catalana three of our five nights in Barcelona. Must tries: Cabreaos, the ham, potatoes bravas, and basically all the montaditos. Waits can be long, but it's worth it!"
3298,10-04-2015 ,2.0,We went at noon. When we asked the waiter for a table he said we have to wait for 40 minutes though we were third on the list and we sat after 10 minutes. He was unfriendly and rude. The tapas were fine but not something special and for desert we had creme brûlée and lemon pie which were delicious! We were expecting for something better...
3299,10-04-2015 ,5.0,"Good food, great atmosphere, fantastic service, best tapas in Barcelona. The queue out of the door told the story, people - locals and visitors love this place. Will definitely return for more on our next visit."
3300,10-04-2015 ,4.0,"I visited this restaurant with my 11 year old son after a tip I got from a friends colleague who lives here. He said this is one of the best places to go to when you want good tapas in Barcelona. I'll have to agree with him, the food was excellent and to a really reasonable price as well. It's a busy place, so if you haven't reserved a table make sure to be there early. When the other restaurants were empty this one is bustling with people and even having a queue out on the street with people waiting to get in. The first night we tried to get in at 20:30 it was full. When we got there an hour earlier we got the last table. It is a busy place, so don't expect the most attention from the staff. They are really busy, but still trying their best to please all their guests and doing a reasonably good job, from my perspective. The food came in quickly, drinks as well and when we asked for the bill we got prompt service as well. "
3301,9-04-2015 ,4.0,"Visited here after a recommendation from our accommodation.We ordered a lot of different dishes, everything was cooked perfectly and tasted amazingEven had to force a dessert even though we were stuffed!Only small issuesAn hour waiting time (although we had been warned of this) Quite noisy "
3302,9-04-2015 ,1.0,"We went to have a drink and a light lunch. We ended up having just a sangria. An elderly gentleman, perhaps the owner, was very welcoming BUT then the barker (as he couldn't have been anything else) barked orders at everyone, including us, walking past trying to get them in. Once we were sat down and didn't have anything to eat (we did ask for two dishes both of which were off - including a child's meal) he was unfriendly, unhelpful and aggressive: he showed no more interest in us, in fact he revealed his total disdain. We drank our sangria and fled!"
3303,8-04-2015 ,4.0,"Just find the place with the huge line outside!- a lot of variety- fast service, seems most the staff is Filipino so they work fast and are the nicest and very efficient, also all speak fluent english- tapas tapas tapas cold beer- do try the mushrooms, fresh asparagus, pick out cold dishes on right hand side- no reservations- TIP, don't just stand around make your way to the host table up front!- yes alot of tourists but good value for your money, waiter told me i ordered too much and I didn't believe him, he was right"
3304,8-04-2015 ,5.0,"The restaurant was so busy that we had to wait 45 mins to get seated. Nonetheless, it is worth waiting for!"
3305,8-04-2015 ,5.0,"Great food, great price and good cheap drinks. Be prepared to wait for a table though as you can't book, it's worth the wait though!"
3306,7-04-2015 ,3.0,After getting to read many reviews we passed by for lunch and I didn't like it that much. I ordered mini burgers and said to be well done and they brought them not medium it was almost raw! I told them and they changed my plate and again red not well done not raw but still not as I like and ordered it though their ham and other tapas etc were fine but you can find many other places better priced
3307,7-04-2015 ,5.0,"Fantastic tapas, great atmosphere, very reasonable prices ... I simply loved this place. The wait to get in was long, but we were able to sneak in at the counter because all the groups in front of us were too large, so if it's just 1 or 2 of you, the wait should not be so bad. The food was worth the wait, and they were happy to serve wine while you waited. Really loved this place, would go back any day!"
3308,6-04-2015 ,4.0,"We had read all the reviews before we went, we therefore knew it would be crowded, noisy with a long waIt but not to be missed. It was all of those things. We fought our way in the door and gave our name and was told it would be an hour and a quarter wait for a table. Seeing all the lovely tapas lined up we decides to wait but ordered drinks at the bar. Seats at the bar became available so we took them and began with Tapas. It was so delicious and fresh. We had another beer each and more tapas ending with Catalonian cream very tasty. We therefore ended up not deeding a table. The staff were chatty, friendly and helpful despite the crowds. Wonderful happy atmosphere. Came out feeling replete... Will definitely go again. Bill came to €30.00 so,excellent,value. Tip: try the crab salad with toast."
3309,6-04-2015 ,4.0,"There many selections of tapas from seafood, meat and veggies. We had octopus, spanish style fried potatoes, mushroom with hams, tuna stick, shrimps and creme brulee. They are all so good!!! The waiting time is long more than one hour on a friday night. The wait staff is not very friendly but the waitress inside was quite nice and helpful."
3310,5-04-2015 ,4.0,"A really long waiting time (1 hour for a group of 4), and no possibility to reserve a table was a bit annoying, but the annoyance went away as soon as you got to the bar and you realized that you could get good wine for €2 / glass or just dig in on the pintxos in the bar.Our group had about 15 different tapas plates, 2 bottles of wine, a large pitcher of sangria and desserts and we ended up paying €110 total which seemed like nothing short of a steal, considering how good the food was."
3311,5-04-2015 ,5.0,"Come here every time we are in Barcelona and it never disappoints, great food, great service, go early as you can wait upto 2 hours for a table later in the day."
3312,5-04-2015 ,4.0,"Fantastic tapas, some of the best in BCN. Definitely worth a visit but time it well. Staff very rushed; if you want a more intimate and authentic experience head to the gothic quarter. If you want to try the food and you don't care about the surroundings, this is great."
3313,4-04-2015 ,1.0,"I went there 3 times with my boyfriend. We are both from barcelona and we used to think it was an ok place to eat few tapas. Two last times it was really noisy, crowed of tourists, the food was oily and not that tasty. We felt like we payed too much for what we got. If you wanna try real tapas consider going somewhere else - says a catalan local from Barcelona. "
3314,1-04-2015 ,5.0,The very best meal we had in al BCN!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Worth waiting. Amazing tapas. Eat lunch! Good location. In and outdoor. Gogogo
3315,31-03-2015 ,4.0,Our waiter suggested he chose our Tapas as we were having so much trouble choosing. Once he established what people didnt eat off he went. We had a fabulous meal with lots of new things to try. Restaurant was full even though we went early - Had heard of the queues that formed - and not suprised now.
3316,30-03-2015 ,5.0,Great value house red - Abadia - really nice.A very full menu with something for everyone.I admit that I now usually go there for lunch when I am in town.
3317,29-03-2015 ,4.0,"Me and my husband had a great experience at this popular restaurant. The waiter spoke good english and the service was good, the food was excellent at reasonable prices. We came quite early (7pm) so got a table straight away, heard its really busy later!"
3318,29-03-2015 ,5.0,"stopped in for an early lunch after touring segrada familia. Waitress was very efficient, spoke English and even recommended her favorite sights. Tapas were all very good. The crispy potatoes with egg on top and a spicy sauce is written on here extensively is not to be missed! Wonderful dining experience."
3319,28-03-2015 ,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant one night after reading some great reviews on Google. We walked over around 9:00PM to a crowd of about 20 waiting outside on the sidewalk! When we finally got to the hostess to inquire about wait times we were told 2 hours. We agreed we wanted to try the place so we put our name down and went to the bar to grab a drink (that we had to drink while standing outside on the sidewalk). I must admit, normally I hate waiting even 10 minutes to be seated, but there was something so lively and exciting about this place and this crowd. They appeared to be made up mostly of 20-30 something yr old locals (who were dressed to the nines). When we did finally manage to sit down, the place was bustling inside. There must been 200 ppl in there. Despite this, the food cam fast and it was to die for!!! We ordered at least 10 different tapas, each better then the last. I would put down what we ordered but my memory is failing me. I remember amazing fried mini poblanos, sardines, mushrooms with truffle oil, and a shrimp and egg dish. Everything was absolutely fabulous. The price wasn't terrible either. All in all, I'm glad we waited it out. I've already recommended this bar to many friends just in case they plan to visit someday."
3320,28-03-2015 ,4.0,"We had a late lunch here and though it was very busy, the food was fab, the service helpful and quick and the prices very reasonable."
3321,28-03-2015 ,5.0,"One of the best places I have been for dinner in Barcelona. The staff service is excellent, the food are excellent. really recommended this place!!"
3322,28-03-2015 ,5.0,"This is my go-to spot for great food and lively atmosphere when I am in Barcelona. The tapas are always excellent quality and very tasty. Prices are reasonable considering the prime location. There is a good variety of both cold tapas and cooked items and the staff is friendly and helpful. It is usually quite crowded at regular meal times, and attracts a lot of tourists, but I never have to wait more than 15-20 minutes to grab a seat at the bar. Some of my favorite dishes are the mussels, baked codfish skewers, and the date and bacon montaditos, but I have never had a bad dish here. The fried camembert with jam is a must have."
3323,27-03-2015 ,5.0,"It was a recommendation from local people. The most amazing recommendation we had ever! We stayed 4 days in Barcelona, and imagine we have been twice in this restaurant! You have probably to wait a bit (and that's the only bad thing) for a table as there are queues of people waiting. But both times we have reserved a table for one hour later and we were walking around in the near area (a lot of shops, bars etc...). The tapas are simply amazing! Try patatas bravas, small squibs, shrimps, tortilla & omelette, and almost everything from the tapas hot dishes! We enjoyed it so so much... and at the end a creme cataluna was also a perfect finish! It was also well-know from all locals in Barcelona as the best tapas in town... Just try it!"
3324,27-03-2015 ,5.0,"I had grill shrimp and cuttlefish, it is great. the shrimp is so fresh and sweet. Cuttlefish is so nice perfect time cook. As I came from Thailand. I always proud of my Thai seafood, but this is as great as Thai seafood."
3325,27-03-2015 ,4.0,"Very good quality of food, friendly staff, crowded with lovely people, nice place to sitt outside - overall I do like a lot the place!"
3326,26-03-2015 ,5.0,Best Tapas at the Best Prices we found. We sat outside and didn't have to wait. Service was excellent and waiters recommendations were spot-on.
3327,26-03-2015 ,5.0,"this place has grown so much, they expanded to next door, so now is a big restaurant, seafood is excellent, Sangria is very good. good ambient to have tapas and drinks, good service. I would say everything you order would be good. make sure you try the home made cake for dessert."
3328,26-03-2015 ,5.0,We were friends very kofortno at this restaurant ! I can recommend it to my friends ... and I wish a good place to visit in your vacation :)
3329,25-03-2015 ,4.0,We visited here in our first visit to Barcelona and a return visit was again well worth it.You always wait as it's busy but it's never really that long and you can have a drink while you wait.All the dishes are cooked well and decent portion sizes. Staff are attentive and the plates come out thick and fast.It's a shame they don't have more seats like the front entrance as at these you can point to the foid front 
3330,25-03-2015 ,5.0,"This place is not at the center of Barcelona is near Pedrera. It has excellent food and someone that visits Barcelona should visit to try the great tapas that they offer. Take into account that the place is overcrowded and either you book in advance or if you go to ask for table be prepared for waiting for at least an hour. We passed by we booked for one hour later, we made a walk and came back after."
3331,24-03-2015 ,4.0,"Second visit, this time with a Spaniard who ordered a selection for us. All very nice, particularly patatas bravas and squid. Good beer too and very reasonableTables outside, inside (you may have to wait) or seats at the bar if you can get one."
3332,23-03-2015 ,5.0,The large queues say it all: this place is the best. The best way to eat tapas here is to await your chance and throw yourself onto a stool at the bar the second somebody leaves. Here you can see some of your great food options directly. All food is great and served very fast. A must-go in Barcelona
3333,23-03-2015 ,4.0,The restaurant was recommended by a friend. The tapas and the local beer was really good. The attention and the speed of service is part of the essential of the A++
3334,23-03-2015 ,4.0,We had dinner at this very popular Tapas restaurant. They don't take reservations so prepare for a quite long wait after you register for a table.The dinner was well worth the wait – very good tapas served and quite a large menu to make your selections from.Lively atmosphere and efficient service.They deliver good value for your money.
3335,23-03-2015 ,4.0,"I've just come back from my second visit in two days and this place is consistently goo dolls! Great atmosphere, quick service or at least at the bar where I sat! Everything I had to eat was delicious and I will be returning!"
3336,23-03-2015 ,5.0,"Loved: the eggs and crispy potatoes, deep fried artichokes and delicious tenderloin montaditos. Would highly recommend for families or business dinners. Yummo!"
3337,22-03-2015 ,5.0,"We went this restaurant after reading the review in TripAdvisor. After a long walk and getting lost in the Spanish city, all family members are grumpy. But tapas served there change our depressing mood into happy camper.The seafood they served was very fresh, ingredients were well selected. But you may want to go there a little earlier since it was packed when we left. Price is relatively high end, but if you come for Tapas-snack with beer, the price is moderate. If you bring all your family, get ready for high bill, but money well spent there. I think the restaurant is located in the middle of downtown/tourist area. But I do not mind work hard before the trip and save money to travel to Barcelona and have tapas in this restaurant."
3338,22-03-2015 ,5.0,"The vibe, the people the long waiting line, the orderly chaos, still the best in Barcelona. The fresh ingredients, the simple yet delicious way of cooking, if you are in Barcelona and want to sample the best tapas look no where else and go straight to the Cerveceria. Wonderfull seafood, great Jamon, to die for patatas bravas....just come with lots of patience, keep your eyes open for the sign of someone getting ready to leave and charge towards the chair at the bar. Oh, and by the way, do prefer the bar than the tables, thats were all is a happening!"
3339,21-03-2015 ,5.0,"We tried to get into the place earlier in the day but the line was ridiculous. So after a night out, we stopped by for a night cap after a night out in L'Eixample. Oh my, I understand why it was packed. The Tapas is the best in BarcelonaIf you're a foodie, put this place towards the top of your list."
3340,20-03-2015 ,4.0,Went twice during 4 day trip. Busy early evening on one visit - still buzzing at 1.00am on the other. Food overall excellent. Tortilla and flan weren't great but everything else was very good. Try Huevos Cabreados - great comfort food. Also went to CalPep during the trip and much preferred Catalana. Bill was ridiculously cheap.
3341,19-03-2015 ,5.0,"Plenty of different tapas for a reasonable price, a wide selection of drinks, especially wines you cannot miss with these delicious tapas.It's usually quite busy, so make sure you bring some time."
3342,19-03-2015 ,5.0,"Excellent food, good service and good prices. It can be very crowded but worth the wait. I recommend the fish dishes"
3343,18-03-2015 ,2.0,"Maybe good for first timers in Spain or for people who wants to be in the middle of big crowds regardless of the food, otherwise not, it is not the place to go for real good tapas. Too many people, no creativity in the food if not absolutely lame and rushed service. There are many places in Barcelona that deserve a visit before this one, if you want to taste great tapas with the chance to have a normal conversation at the same time."
3344,18-03-2015 ,4.0,"Went for a dinner of tapas and wine with some business colleagues - we had a great time. This place has excellent tapas, a nice selection of wines, and a great atmosphere.There is a nice energy live of both the crowd and the wait staff. The service is excellent and the team contributes to a wonderful experience. We had such a good time we ended up eating and drinking for 3.5 hours.Go and enjoy."
3345,17-03-2015 ,5.0,"Our favorite tapas bar. Not our favorite place in Barcelona, but definately our favorite for tapas. We waited about an hour to get in, but worth it. Went shopping in the area while we waited for a table. All the tapas we got were fantastic and there is a good variety. It looks packed and crazy from the outside, but once you have a table inside, it is much more comfortable than it looks. It is also not crazy priced for the amount of attention it gets. Still a bit pricy, but this one is worth the high prices."
3346,17-03-2015 ,5.0,Visited for dinner on 17 Mar15. Got a table quickly at 7.30pm. Place was buzzing. Huge restaurant with outdoor seating. Clean neat and very commercial. Quick service with all English speaking waiters. Menu in English. Great selection of tapas and wines. Best waiter ... Fredrick .. Lucky to have him on my table. Suggested some amazing tapas .. Fried Artichokes . Other nice tapas was the 'small fried fish' and baguette with foie and Roquefort cheese. Simply amazing! Definitely going there again . Cons .. No music and ambience is very commercial ... Not for a romantic dinner. But other than that I thought the food and service was the best in my stay in Barca! Don't miss this one ...
3347,17-03-2015 ,5.0,"Tapas,seafood, wine And service !!In the middle of downtown Barcrlona Next to all monuments like La Pedrera And Casa batllo The best restaurant in Barcelona Excellent food , excellents wines and the service Also good prices !!"
3348,17-03-2015 ,5.0,"Just on a corner with "" las ramblas de Catalunya "" so very central this place is a masterpiece - or should i say a centerpiece - of/for tapas of every sort you can wish for . And boy does it deliver ! The place is not that special by its looks but the minute you start eating those lovely tapas this is the word that hits you : special ! You will enjoy every minute you spent here and will get the right sense of what tapas meas and why they are so great !"
3349,14-03-2015 ,5.0,"You have to stop at Cerveceria Barcelona when you are in town, this is clearly one of the best tapas restaurants in BCN. My advice is to go a bit early if you want to find some space - before 1pm and before 8pm. The restaurant gets very crowded during the busy hours.I had wonderful dishes the last time I ate there: an incredible risotto with mushrooms and artichokes, excellent little clams sauteed with wine and delicious red peppers stuffed with cod and covered with grilled cheese. Staff is always super pleasant and efficient."
3350,13-03-2015 ,5.0,"We had read about this restaurant on trip advisor and seen the reviews so went down on a Tuesday evening around 8pm. To our surprise it was absolutely booming we could hardly move at the front of the restaurant, the lady who was front of house took our names and said it would be a 45 minute wait, we got some drinks and had been called within 25 minutes. We sat down and the waiters were very attentive. The whole place was in English, the menus and the waiters spoke directly in English. Nice for us as native English speakers but perhaps lacking the authenticity of the some of the other restaurants in Barcelona, although it is obviously very popular. The food was very nice, it came out quickly and the waiters were happy for us to order more. It was good value too, came to about €40 for six dishes a jug of sangria and a beer. Would definitely go back, but would recommend booking as it was extremely busy. It is a fair sized restaurant though so could accommodate a lot of people "
3351,12-03-2015 ,5.0,"If you want to eat good tapas, this is the place to go! It's a popular place, so you will probably have to wait for a little while, but it's worth it!You get really good food, and the atmosphere is typical spanish. The prices were good."
3352,12-03-2015 ,4.0,"Great food - very popular among locals!The interior is not so exiting, but the food is great. Usually we experienced waiting time of 45-60 min, so be there early or prepare to wait. The food is worth waiting for!"
3353,12-03-2015 ,5.0,This restaurant has everything that I love in a tapas bar. It's busy. Very tasty and fresh tapas. I would go back everytime I am in town!!
3354,10-03-2015 ,3.0,"This is one of Barcelona's ""most famous"" tapas bars, and in some ways the reputation is justified. In general the quality of the food is quite good, the service always cordial, attentive and fast (once you get your order in!). Nothing extraordinary on the menu, but you will not be disappointed with what you order. The ambiance is one of an ""in"" place (wait on line outside, lots of happy people crowded together drinking and waiting for the tapas ""experience""). Very touristy, but that is ok, too. Be very careful with your handbag and wallet. The outside terrace is notorious for nicely dressed and very adept pickpockets!"
3355,9-03-2015 ,5.0,"Absolutely a must if you are seafood tapas lovers. Crowded but very nice and friendly service, please don't hesitate to ask the waitress for recommendations if you can't read their Spanish daily menu, we've tried an excellent scallop which is not on the standard English menu. Also, unless you are starving for bread, I recommend you to try out their sandwiches instead of ordering a plain bread, you may not have the appetite to fill your stomach with all those lovely and tasty food"
3356,8-03-2015 ,5.0,"First found this place on a visit 10+ years ago & make a point of returning each time I visit Barcelona.Just back from another short trip & thought about time I reviewed this little gem. I've eaten here on several occasions over the past few years & once again this week have had the most amazing food & fun eating that you could wish for. This place gets super busy due to the quality of the food they serve, its not a big place & seating is limited, we dropped by for lunch at 12ish on a Saturday & by 1pm it was packed with tourists & locals alike.There are two counters at which you can sit on stools or a restaurant further back we opted for the bar counter option because its more authentic way of eating tapas & the atmosphere in this area helps make the experience.The food is exceptional & the how the staff serving keep track of all the orders they have running is incredible.The tapas they serve are so nice, we sat eating for 2 hours + & together with wine our bill was 43 euros so not expensive for the quality of food on offer."
3357,7-03-2015 ,4.0,"This place might be on the pricier side but their tapas is real good. The atmosphere is amazing. It gets really full, especially at peak times so you might want to call ahead to make reservations. The servers are friendly and give you some suggestions on which plates to order! Make sure to order patatas bravas and the different types of ham! "
3358,7-03-2015 ,5.0,"One of the best experiences here, waiting time is worth it. Try it! I keep coming after 9 years and still; my favorite cerveceria here "
3359,7-03-2015 ,4.0,"Visited with 2 colleagues, enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food. Ideal place for business lunch or dinner, as well as to enjoy their Tapas with your friends and family."
3360,6-03-2015 ,3.0,We waited for an hour to get a table because we were told 'tapas will never be the same for you' but actually the food wasn't nothing out of this world. It's not bad but it's expensive and we later heard there is a restaurant called 'La Flauta' that is very similar and much cheaper!
3361,5-03-2015 ,5.0,"We got there around 8pm and there was already a long wait, but vibe looked great so we decided it was worth the wait. We ended up sitting at the bar within a few minutes of getting there, the food was AWESOME, service was great and met great people. We wished we could have sat outside, nonetheless we had a great time."
3362,5-03-2015 ,5.0,"Great food, I really enjoyed the tapas there and the local wine that one of the guests there recommended us.Great atmosphere, very friendly staff.Only issue is that most of the times you have to wait a long time since there is no reservation, but we came wrote our names and went to very nice walk so its was great."
3363,4-03-2015 ,5.0,"We had a couple of recommendations for this restaurant - it was extremely busy as they don't take reservations but the wait time was only about 20 mins. The bar was packed but the atmosphere was great and the staff were very efficient. We had a drink at the bar whilst waiting.There is an extensive tapas menu as well as an additional one with daily specials and the waiters were very helpful in explaining the dishes, all of which were excellent and reasonably priced. Our only regret was that we ordered everything at once rather than pacing ourselves but we enjoyed it so much we decided to return the following evening for my wife's birthday to sample more dishes at a slower rate. Same wait time but we were not disappointed and the food was just as good - different waiters but all very friendly as before, and finished off when they provided a delicious piece of cake with a sparkling candle on it."
3364,4-03-2015 ,4.0,"Lively, crowded tapas restaurant. Theta always a line. .be prepared to wait for over 30 minutes ( can walk the neighborhood) but it's worth the wait. "
3365,4-03-2015 ,5.0,"Because of the high rates on TA we decided to check out this restaurant (without reservation), but it looked like everybody in Barcelona had the same plan. The place was crowded with waiting people and it seemed a bit chaotic, but the lady at the desk managed to stay friendly and professional. After waiting 1,5 hours we finally could sit down. The tapas was great, no wonder everybody wants to eat here. Good service, nice wines, reasonably priced. Very recommended!"
3366,2-03-2015 ,5.0,"We have tried so many tapas places in Barcelona, and this one is far the best and our favourite! They have a huge range and are reasonably priced. The regular menu has the basics - patatas bravas (yummy!), fried baby squid (also yummy) but check out the daily menu which never fails to please. We had an exquisite mushroom, potato and foie gras timbale. The sangria here is also very good. The only downside is that it is almost always full - so come for an early lunch (12.30/1) or an early dinner (7/7.30) for the best chance to get in. They are open from mid morning till late at night. Enjoy!"
3367,2-03-2015 ,5.0,"The food was great! We enjoy of a few tapas, drank sangria and a couple of whiskies, at the end we enjoy of a marvelous cake that have a little bit of rum and whipped cream at its top. Very Recommended!"
3368,2-03-2015 ,4.0,"Lots of terrible places to eat in Barcelona, look good and genuine on the outside but serve really bad food dressed up as authentic tapas - I work in Barcelona a couple of times a month and often fall foul of the Barcelona tapas bar...I expected the same from this one, incredibly busy, full of tourists being very centrally located...for once, the food and service was beyond my expectation and I really enjoyed the full on atmosphere. There are better places but I had a good, fun evening here and the food was above average and would definitely come back."
3369,1-03-2015 ,5.0,"Great Barcelona location, active all day long when surrounding places are empty! Great food, great service and good ambiance. Located in Rambla Catalunya. Cannot go wrong. "
3370,27-02-2015 ,1.0,"My wife and I went to this restaurant on 27/02/15 whilst visiting the beautiful city of barcelona for the weekend. We had been recommended this restaurant by a friend who frequents it regularly so we were very excited.The food was above average authentic tapas. However we ordered red peppers with cod and found a long hair within the cod purée. We made this known to our hostess who showed little interest and replaced it. By this point, both my wife and I had lost our appetite aand stopped eating. (Rubbish being taken through the restaurant past our table didn't add to the ambience either.) I called the manager over (Jordi) to inform him as the waitress didn't seem to care and he was even less interested. Promptly snatching our plates away with absolutely no apology.I had to inform them I wasn't paying for the ""hair"" food and the food delivered afterwards, that we didn't eat, due to loss of appetite. All in all, after waiting for an hour for a table, both my wife and I were very disappointed.This is the first bad review I've ever written. I'm not usually a ""complainer"". May have been bad luck but the attitude and general hygiene was less than satisfactory.Anyone from this restaurant feel free to respond."

3372,27-02-2015 ,4.0,"Amazing food, amazing experience... If you do not have to wait more than an hour to be seated... No reservations allowed. But once you make it, it's very good!"
3373,25-02-2015 ,4.0,I had the best beef tenderloin in my life here. The rest of everything is also good but less memorable.
3374,25-02-2015 ,4.0,"this restaurant is just a few minutes walk from my hotel, walked in at around 8:00 pm but full of people waiting inside for tables and counters. Finally got seat outside under 7 degree at night without waiting. Service is average with limited choice in English menu. Food is above average except ham was too salty, still recommended to go for its tapas food."
3375,25-02-2015 ,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, it's pretty okay but definitely not great. Okay it's crowed and you have to wait between 30min to one hour. But you know that in front, so you won't hear me complain about that. But then you expected the food to be good at least and the service adequate. Sadly non of both. It looks, feels and tastes more like a fast food restaurant than authentic tapas. The place is packed, it's really noisy. Waiters run around and throw down the plates. Sleezy touristic jokes with each serving. And than the food, over salted and over oiled. No tasty ingredients or spices. Just oil and salt. Wouldn't recommend it. There's loads more of better places in the neighborhood. "
3376,25-02-2015 ,4.0,"Visited this busy restaurant at lunch time to find it absolutely packed, the atmosphere was great and the place was buzzing.We had no reservation and got seated within about ten minutes.The menu has a good variety of tapas, and also a specials list, which you can walk up to the 'bar' area and pick out which ones you want and give them your table number.Food arrives quickly, and the waiters are attentive. We would have to say it was one of the best tapas meals we have had. The only recommendation I would say is to keep track of what you have ordered, as a couple of items we did not have appeared on our bill, this could be a simple mistake and was easily rectified, but if you had a large group with the food orders flowing this would be difficult to track. Overall good experiemce, tasty food, and good value. I would recommend."
3377,25-02-2015 ,5.0,"Cerveseria Catalana was opened several years ago with almost no money by an ambitious guy, now this place is extremely popular and he has about 6 restaurants in Barcelona. It is a touristic place unfortunately, but still you can see some spaniards there as well. They serve tapas, flautas (some kind of sandwich), salads and small dishes. We had gambas, mushrooms, patatas bravas, goat`s cheese, octopus...everything was really good. Crema catalan looked very tempting as well, haven`t tried it though. They have a huge choice of international beers. The bad part about this tapas bar is, that you can`t make any reservation. Only if you are already there, they write down your name and you can expect to wait about an hour to get a table (at least at weekends). You won`t get bored though, just get yourself a drink, outside are standing loads of people drinking and smoking and you can do some people watching in your waiting time :). Tapas cost about 4 EUR each. It is also a very noisy place, it is probably not the right location for a romantic dinner à deux :)."
3378,24-02-2015 ,5.0,"I always take there all my friends and guests when they come to Barcelona, even if you can not make a reservation and need to wait for a while before geting the table, I absolutely recommend this restaurant. Service is quick, personal very nice and food excellent"
3379,23-02-2015 ,4.0,"Really good value , nice food , very reasonable , nice staff . This restaurant was packed on late Sunday afternoon when most others were empty . We took that as a good sign and were not disappointed ."
3380,22-02-2015 ,5.0,"This place is hard to get into but well worth it. If you go early you can sometimes get a table. We didn’t have one plate that was empty after our visit. I can recommend the potatoes bravas, “pissed-off” eggs - (I can’t remember what it was in Spanish), and chorizo. Get some Sangria too!"
3381,22-02-2015 ,5.0,We had 5 different tapas and half a litre of sangria for 32 euros! Service charge and vat included! The food was orgasmic! We will definitely go back there! 
3382,21-02-2015 ,5.0,"Just a few steps from Rambla de Catalunya, this restaurant had the best tapas of our trip! The croquettes were especially delicious, but every dish was a winner."
3383,21-02-2015 ,3.0,Unbearable salty... feel the limit ur tongue.but the service was good. 
3384,21-02-2015 ,5.0,"This restaurant is absolutely stellar. My boyfriend and I went there twice: On the first occasion it was super busy and we had to queue but for barely 5 minutes and it was SO worth the wait! We sat on the bar so could see all the delicious tapas and the waiters were very helping in making our choice. The house wine was really delicious and incredibly cheap. Our bill for two came to 37 euros which was astonishingly cheap for 4 glasses of wine and 6/7 tapas dishes! The second occasion (on valentines day!), we got a table immediately (it was around 7pm, so relatively early dinner) and were again served fantastically delicious food with very quick and friendly service. We splashed out on a whole bottle of wine and the bill was barely 40 euros. I can't stress enough how wonderful this restaurant is. A MUST for anyone in Barcelona who enjoys delicious food."
3385,20-02-2015 ,4.0,"They are very good in terms of quality per price. All tapas are very delicious and atmosphere is very otantique. One can understand that it’s good from the crowd coming there all during the day. I was able to find a place only after the rush hour at 9-10 pm. I recommend you to take a seat at the bar and order from the tapas that come from the kitchen. It’s not because to catch the fresh ones, but to catch the tapas before they are finished!"
3386,19-02-2015 ,4.0,"Difficult to get a seat/table between 1pm and 3pm but it is definitely is a good place to have some tapas, food and beer. It is a little bit expensive but it is a good place to try real Spanish food.Service is not very good but acceptable."
3387,18-02-2015 ,5.0,"One of the best meals you could take in Barcelona at a reasonable price. The food quality is very good, although the service and the time you have to wait to get a table are big disadvantages to this restaurant.I would recommend to go there write your name down on the list and back to main street for some drinks, otherwise you can easily be waiting around an hour in order to get a table. But once you sit and get some food, you forget about the waiting time."
3388,18-02-2015 ,5.0,"We arrived at the restaurant around 8:30pm and the line was literally out the door! After enjoying the tapas and wonderful sangria, I understand why people wait. Service was great! The beef tenderloin was fantastic. Highly recommend this restaurant! "
3389,18-02-2015 ,3.0,"Those kind of places you can find in every crowded City in the World. Totally business oriented is a machine of serving ""tapas"" to tourists, (very few locals on average). The name does not correspond to the truth. The only catalan products served are pa amb tomaquet and all i oli I guess?. Products are correct but you feel like a number in the middle of an over crowded restaurant where english is the main language. If you're american, english or german and want to enjoy of a re-interpreted and marketed spanish tapa, then this is your place. If you want to be in a good restaurant and eat what and how locals eat, you have much better places to go I'm afraid."
3390,18-02-2015 ,4.0,"Very popular with locals and always very busy which creates a great atmosphere. Fantastic and varied choice of tapas, great on quality and not skimping on helpings. Staff were very helpful with advice and checked on us regularly to see if we were ok and if wanted anything else - which we did! The wine was also excellent value and good quality.Even in February we ate outside under the awnings - great atmosphere and would highly recommend."
3391,18-02-2015 ,4.0,"There's always a,line outside and if you go in August you'll be one among zillions of tourists. But food is good - variety and quality - and the price tag is fair. I got bravas, escalivada and other favourite seafood choices and everybody was happy. Staff was super nice and they all spoke English. To survive queuing, let your name with the hostess and go for a walk in Paseo de Gracia. "
3392,18-02-2015 ,5.0,Really nice experience. You always have to queue but it worth it. Fresh ingredients and good service.
3393,18-02-2015 ,4.0,"We only had 2 nights in Barcelona and we ate here on our first night. We had been advised by a Spanish friend to chose the set tapas of 10 dishes. This wasn't on the menu but there was a set tapas of 5 dishes and there was only my wife and I so it was plenty. Good food, and good size dishes but there was something lacking with the atmosphere, we felt like we were just part of a customer rotation process, which I suppose all customers are. It was like, come in, eat up, leave, next!"
3394,18-02-2015 ,5.0,"I had dinner and lunch on this trip and will likely return before I leave Barcelona in 4 days. The line and wait were long but patience was rewarded. The wait staff were incredibly efficient once I was seated. The tapas selection is expansive and warrants several returns on this trip. Tapas are freshly prepared with a changing daily selection. Selection of beers and wines is also excellent. Once seated, while service was efficient, I was not rushed out the door at the end of the meal. I had been here 8-9 years ago and they have upped their game since that early visit."
3395,17-02-2015 ,5.0,"Fantastic tapas restaurant. Would recommend getting there before 8:00. Food was gorgeous, sangria to die for and all at an incredible price! "
3396,16-02-2015 ,5.0,"Yes, you will see many tourists in this restaurant but there are many locals as well. I have eaten in many restaurants in Barcelona and Cerveceria Catalana is hands down my favorite. Everything is EXCELLENT. Inexpensive and large portions for tapas. We were in Barcelona for 6 days and although we ate in a different restaurant every night we ate at Cerveceria Catalana every day for lunch. Yes, 6 times and they were all fabulous. The red sangria is the also the best we had in Barcelona. "
3397,15-02-2015 ,4.0,"It is probably one of the best Tapas places in Barcelona.Every time I'm in town, I'm planning my time with at list one visit at the Cerveceria.Food is excellent, fresh and some of the dishes are huge, so don't worry, you won't stay hungry..If you really wish to avoid the astronomic lines, try to get there before 1 PM for lunch & before 7 PM for dinner.One of my favorite was the French Fries with an egg on top of it (sunny side up egg) and the server mix the egg with the fries when he brings it to the table. It's called ""Cabreaos eggs style""BTW, after the first evening we had dinner over there and we had to wait so long to get in, for the next day, we've decided to go the twin restaurant called ""Ciudad Condal"" which have the same menu, same delicious taste but shorter wait time.. It's just couple of blocks away.Just can't wait to go there again!"
3398,15-02-2015 ,5.0,"Huge selection of tapas avaialable at reasonable (not cheap though) price. I would recommend making a reservation in case you plan to visit during peak hours (after 20,00). The place gets really crowded then..."
3399,14-02-2015 ,4.0,"Very delicious food, very good quality of dishes. Service could be improved though. Dishes were not served at the same time. The sangria was OK. The Roscon for desert was yummy. "
3400,13-02-2015 ,4.0,"Our hotel recommended Cerveceria Catalana. It was an odd time (before usual lunch) so we didn't have to wait like you usually do. Our server was friendly and made good recommendations based on our requests. We asked to sit outside, not realizing that is where the smokers sit, so be aware. The shrimp were perfect, the toasted goat cheese vegetable casserole delicious and the salad hit a healthy spot after all that traveling. Prices were reasonable. Definitely recommended."
3401,11-02-2015 ,4.0,"The restaurant was recommended by a few friends of ours so we decided to go for a short stroll from our apartment to test their culinary opinion. We were not disappointed. Atmosphere was great. Fancy but not snobby. Food was pretty amazing. The ones worth mentioning are: grilled cod 10/10 (melt in your mouth fresh cod with perfectly balanced tomato and onion relish) and the 'Cabreos' egg style 8/10 recommended by the waitress (creamy egg with a sweet sauce smothering some deep fried crunchy goodness). Can't go wrong. Food came out within 5-10 minutes and the place was pretty bustling at 4:30pm. Quick dinner cost my sister and I, $35 EURO total (including half a bottle of wine). "
3402,11-02-2015 ,5.0,"We visited here three times during our stay in Barcelona on the recommendation of the Olivia Balmes Hotel staff. We would recommend you sit at the bar counter rather than the restaurant if your single or as a couple as the atmosphere is electric. Cerveceria Catalana is extremely busy, they don't take reservations and you might find the queues off putting but their table management is excellent so do stay, its worth the wait. They don't take reservations for the counter seating, this is on a 'grab the seat as it becomes available' basis. The food is very reasonably priced, the seafood and the beef are top quality and the rioja is to die for. We would recommend getting there early evening but also bear in mind they open first thing in the morning so you can treat yourself any time of the day. We can't recommend this restaurant highly enough - try it!"
3403,10-02-2015 ,5.0,"We were so pleased with our first meal there that we chose to go back again two days later. Wonderful and plentiful tapas bar, excellent and quick service, reasonable prices. Enjoyed every bite. Well worth the wait for a table. "
3404,9-02-2015 ,4.0,I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and we had a great time. Delicious tapas and a great selection. The cava sangria was amazing. The staff was very friendly and spoke english very well. Food came very quick! I would suggest ordering a few things and then see if you want more as food comes quickly. Then you won't order too much right off the bat.
3405,9-02-2015 ,5.0,"GREAT restaurant for tapas, they open most days at 9am until 12 or 1 in the morning. Locals like it a lot and is full of locals, but tourist also like this restaurant and they are there too. It is always very busy and sometimes you have to wait. The food is tapas and they have a great variety of them, tapas are best when you share and order a lot of different ones the portions are not very big, just the right size to share. The have a regular menu and also the specials of the day menuYou must have to have desserts!We liked it some much that we went twice"
3406,9-02-2015 ,5.0,"We went here for dinner around 8 PM on a Saturday night as the place was a block away from our hotel and recommended by the hotel staff. The place was packed with standing room only around the bar and the wait for a table was around 40 minutes for us. The wait was well worth it and we enjoyed the energy of the place. Once we were seated, we were never rushed at any time during our meal even though there were still hungry crowds waiting. We ordered several sections which included the compo, which comes with calamari, clams, peppers, and shrimp, as well as a few other items such as the crusted grilled cheese. Top the meal off with an espresso and off to enjoy Saturday night!They are open until 1:30 AM and if you are not into the wait for a table, 7:00 PM is the best time to come o avoid a long wait. If time is not an issue, go for the wait and have a glass of wine elbow to elbow with the locals!"
3407,8-02-2015 ,5.0,"We liked it so much that we went there twice during our 5 day trip to Barcelona. All of the tapas we tried were delicious with the expection of black paella with squid. Lobster paella was out of this world. Grilled red shrimps, artichokes with fois gras, fried camambert were all very tasty.You can sit at the tables or the tapas bar. We preferred to sit at the bar as you have the chance to see the food you want to order and also you wait less to be seated. The prices were very reasonably for a major European city."
3408,7-02-2015 ,4.0,"Very crowded place, they don't take reservations, but we only had to wait 10 minutes.We were two, but ordered many dishes with a nice bottle of white wine. Both the food and wine were very good.The food was fresh and due to the high number of diners there shouldn't be a worry for the freshness of food.The deserts were excellent. We took the house cake, which was terrific and cream Catalan, which was very good as well.Over all a very nice experience."
3409,6-02-2015 ,4.0,"Really pleasant staff in large restaurant, large portions of all the normal tapas that you would expect and really tasty but if you're looking for something unusual this is definitely not it. Good for first-timers to Spain/tapas."
3410,6-02-2015 ,5.0,Not to miss on any trip to Barcelona! We visited twice during our 3 days in Barcelona. The food and service were amazing. Definitely order the bread with tomato as an appetizer. All the tapas were delicious. You may need to wait for a seat during prime meal times but it is well worth it.
3411,4-02-2015 ,5.0,"I went there with my wife and daughter. We ate fish,baby calamary, prawn, patatos bravas and 3 kind of veg.tapas with drinks, paid just 47 Euro... Tapas were so delicious. Would like to go again"
3412,1-02-2015 ,4.0,"I've been to Cerveceria Catalana several times. As a couple, with family and with friends. The staff is really kind and always willing to help. The food is consistent and really good. You have a lot of choice (salads, tapas, cold tapas, sandwiches) and you should ask for the ""tapas of the day card"".Take notice that the waiting time can variate between 30min and 1,5h but you can order a glass of wine while waiting.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because you'll might feel rushed because of all the people waiting."
3413,29-01-2015 ,5.0,Have a seat at the bar – best place for ordering food and drinks – you will see all the different foods in front of you – I return again and again never disappointed – fantastic sea food dishes - I always end up eating more than I think but all is super good and fresh
3414,29-01-2015 ,5.0,"A friend suggested this place and i called him to thank.Great variety,and almost everything perfect.I didnt have a great appreciation for tapas from my last trip to Barcelona,but now i am a fan.!!!"
3415,28-01-2015 ,5.0,"I was recommended Catalana by the hostess at the hotel where I was staying. The first time we went, it was 4pm on a hot, summer day. The restaurant was half full then and we had the pleasure of fine dining for as long as we wanted. The menu was so extravagant that it made me want to order almost everything on the list. Every small plate that came met my expectations and it made me crave for it so much that I wanted to have dinner in Catalana every single day for the rest of my trip. I would recommend the padron peppers!!"
3416,28-01-2015 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us and we were not let down. Firstly the host greeted us courteously and gave us accurate feedback, on wait time which was not long at all. Our waiters were all patient with the language difference and went out of their way to try and ensure we understood the menu and the dishes. They were very friendly and efficient. Then the food came and we savoured every bite. It was outstanding Tapas. And at a fair price."
3417,28-01-2015 ,5.0,"Barcelona is certainly full of wine and Tapas restaurants, however this one is outstanding.Not only can you get a classic salad, rare for this region, but the fried potatoes, steak tapas, fried calamari and ham and cheese tapas leave you filled, fulfilled and no room for desert!!!"
3418,27-01-2015 ,4.0,"Came here on a recommendation from my friend and she said I must try. Luckily we did. We did have to wait about 20mins for a table but I guess it shows the restaurant is good. As we were taken to our table round the back, we did see a lot of empty tables- so it may just be lack of staffs hence the wait.One disappointment were the waiter that served us were a bit grumpy and rude, it felt like he didn't want to serve us or explain some dishes to us. We did have two waiters on the night, the other one were more friendly and kept smiling as he served us.Despite the wait and half the bad service, we weren't disappoint with the food. Especially the potato fries with egg! That was YUMMY!I do recommend this place and will come back and I hope that when I return, the service will be a little bit better."
3419,26-01-2015 ,5.0,We've been to this restaurant twice now and on both occasions the food and service was superb. Really lovely decor and ambiance. Definitely worth a visit if your in Barcelona. Plenty of tapa's and a bottle of wine expect to pay 25 euro per head.
3420,25-01-2015 ,4.0,"They might have the best tapas in BCN, it's just a putty that it takes so long to get a table... Also expect to pay on average 20 Euros... I know, not the cheapest tapas. But definitely worth going!"
3421,24-01-2015 ,5.0,spent several days in Barcelona and I would have to say this was the best tapas my family and I had there. This place was always busy and you had to wait for a table but the spaniards have dinner late if you have dinner earlier like 6pm or so its easy to get into. Its not that the food is amazing its that its really reasonably priced aswell. So if your in Barcelona you definitely have to eat here we ate there a couple of times.
3422,24-01-2015 ,5.0,"We had a great diner there on a Thursday night around 21.00Place was crowded and lovely. In 10 minutes we have been offered to take the bar seats and replace to a table when possible.Food was amazing, beginning with pastas bravgets and many more asparagus,Best small hamburgers everGreat wineLong list of fine desertsOverall amazingly good50 Euro for 2 people"
3423,24-01-2015 ,4.0,"This place was extraordinary - Seafood was amazing, we tried some artichokes hearts that were like tempurized and their desserts were great! Must Try!"
3424,22-01-2015 ,5.0,"i had two dishes with beef tenderoin(both come with bread), fried baby squids, fried peppers, and one bottle of cava. it came up around 32 euros i think. every dish seems up to the standards. worth visiting. "
3425,22-01-2015 ,5.0,"Just spent three days in Barcelona. On the first night ate tapas just off the place de Catalonia. Very regrettable choice! Then discovered this gem. Food was excellent we ate outside as didn't want to wait to eat inside, very attentive staff. The quality of the staff and food were first class. As for value, it cannot be beaten! I would recommend anyone to try this gem."
3426,21-01-2015 ,4.0,Very busy place and had to wait for a table which was fine. The menu is very much like most tapas bars. Some of the dishes were great but others not so good. 
3427,20-01-2015 ,1.0,The only think to like was the look of the place and the look of the food. Don't be fooled. I should have known better than tomcat Ina tourist spot. The service was worse than abysmal. Waitress not listening. Not attentive. Slamming wine and beer on the table. The food was cold...and we ordered hot tapas. Just avoid this place at all costs.
3428,20-01-2015 ,4.0,"This restaurant is not too far from the Ramblas. The waiter seemed rather annoyed and did not want to answer questions which made the experience very uncomfortable. The tapas were good not great. For the price you pay, it is not worth it. I spent 60 euro for two people and we were still hungry. (We are very fit small people). The hostess was very nice however. If you are going to try tapas, you can try them at a less expensive place. They are all the same."
3429,20-01-2015 ,3.0,"Honestly, it looks like its location - at a well-visible street corner - makes this place more popular than it should be.Place is always insanely packed, had to wait for about an hour and a half for a table (it's well organised, they tell you the time when you would have to come back).The food was good, but not special. Same for the wine, really, and their selection wasn't as good. From what I could see, our neighbours were having some kind of platter of different sausages etc., and it looked rather simple as well.It's good, just not as exceptional as its reviews and rating suggest, - and so overall a disappointment. It's not like you don't have a choice, and many other places do things better.Maybe just going to the tapas bar was better, but then we weren't really offered the option to, so I can't say whether all the positive reviews refer to the bar part.For a great, local tapas/pintxos experience, go to Taktika Berri.For amazing tuna, go to Topik."
3430,18-01-2015 ,5.0,"The other restaurants we've been to in the last 4 days have been great to terrific, but at Cerveceria Catalana, the food, service, and prices was the best. Try the calamares romana (lightly fried), tapita de pulpo (grilled and sliced octopus on a bed of pureed mashed potatoes with smoked paprika), langostinos (shrimp), mini hamburger, and a fresh salad! So hard to get great salad in Barcelona. Sangria was lovely, desserts so, so, but not enough to mark this down from excellent. We got there at 10:30pm on a rainy night, so there was no line. We lucked out. Otherwise, expect a wait. We will go back! "
3431,17-01-2015 ,5.0,"Very good Tapas, would have been worth the wait. Seafood was my favorite, and had daily specials as well. Bustling atmosphere adds to the fun. We did go during busy times, but tables for two were readily available. "
3432,15-01-2015 ,5.0,"This Tapas' inn is one of the most popular restaurants in Barcelona and I have to admit that its reputation is founded. Warm welcome, fast and efficient service, huge assortment of tapas of all kinds of meat, fish and vegetables.On advice of the nice Meitre we tasted: Cod with goat cheese , skewers of shrimps and squids, red prawns sauteed, fried anchovies, grilled asparagus, coconut cake and an amazing catalan custard.All great ....I can't wait to go back ... olè!"
3433,15-01-2015 ,1.0,"We were 8 people to have dinner and when we got the table, after 1 hour in the queue, 4 people were coming and they said, all people have to arrive in less of 5 minutes or you will lost the table and you have to wait again 1 hour in the queue. My friends arrived in some minutes and when we were seated, they say, you have a maximum of 2 hours to eat. What? Seriously we have to wait 1 hour and eat fast checking the time to eat ""normal"" tapas?There are a lot of better options to eat tapas in Barcelona, better service and quality."
3434,14-01-2015 ,4.0,Good tapas - good service. Try to get a seat in the bar for the right experience. Get here in time cause it can get crowded.
3435,13-01-2015 ,5.0,"Great service, excellent selection of tapas and very well priced. Portions were very sensible and good value for money. Get there before 7 or there is a long wait."
3436,13-01-2015 ,4.0,"A Spanish friend recommended to us this popular tapas restaurant. To avoid the usual long queue, we went there during tea break. There was already a crowd in there. Walking to our table, we can see the wide range of tapas along the bar. They all looked so yummy. We loved the Spanish (potato) omelette, fried squids and the toasted bread. It was kind of a noisy atmosphere but the delicious food made up for that. Even though the staffs were always busy with the crowd but they were always attentive to serving customers. Noticing that I am a Moslem, the supervisor told the waitress serving us and pointed out the dishes that contained pork. That was kind of him and an excellent customer service. I shall definitely drop by C Catalana on my next trip to Barcelona."

3438,13-01-2015 ,3.0,"Basically, everything was fine, there was the expected wait etc, but not so fine was how absolutely rude the host was. The waiters were nice.The host was extremely rude, kicked us off the table, even though we were ordering a good amount and were 8 people squeezed into a small outdoor roundtable, because apparently we had exhausted our 2 hour maximum sitting time.Really?We waited 1 hour for a table we were only allowed to sit at for 2 hours.My friend (spanish) asked to speak to the manager, the manager said if we didn't like it, too bad.The food is pretty standard, you can get the same elsewhere, minus the attitude."
3439,12-01-2015 ,5.0,Went there for a late dinner and sat at the bar. It was quite crowded. Tapas are so delicious! The atmosphere with all its noise is really awesome! 
3440,12-01-2015 ,5.0,"Lively place with great choice of food, refreshing caña and top service. Could sit there chatting, drinking and munch all night."
3441,12-01-2015 ,5.0,"If i had just one place to recommend when you go to barcelona, this is it.Amazing food, atmosphere, service and price. Never change!! "
3442,12-01-2015 ,2.0,"I don't like to give bad reviews, but we waited in line for about 45 minutes, only to regret the entire thing. The place is absolutely chaotic and noisy. Felt like we were inconveniencing our waitress by asking questions and ordering food. In any case, neither of us cared for our food at all - one of us vegetarian and the other adventurous. The only thing memorable about the evening was the high cost and lack of value. Don't waste your time."
3443,11-01-2015 ,5.0,"This place was recommended to us by our hoteliers last year. Since then, it is our favorite in this area. They serve all the classical tapas, like Patatas Bravas or Salad de Rus. Portions are generous, prices are reasonable and service is nice. Our recommendation is to come outside the usual dining time, as there are queues during lunchtime. Hope you will enjoy it as well!"
3444,11-01-2015 ,5.0,"I'm not normally a fan of tapas which past experience has led me to believe translates to 'we make lots of money and provide ordinary food'. However our experience here was quite different. The food was outstanding, and not overpriced. The service was great. We went late afternoon so we probably didn't suffer the crowds other reviews refer to. I would certainly return. The Creme Catalan was terrific."
3445,10-01-2015 ,4.0,We had located another tapas bar nearby rated higher on TA (name forgotten) but didn't fancy it when we got there. We were so lucky to find this place. We went early and got in straight away but when we left people were queueing. There are a few outside (heated) seats but the indoor room is vast. Food was fab. Especially the squid.
3446,10-01-2015 ,5.0,"Authentic Catalonian tapas! Crowded, but not in a bad way. Full of locals who look like they come here very often. Always a good sign. "
3447,10-01-2015 ,3.0,"We went based on the recommendations of tripadvisor's reviews. The place is full of tourists (not necessarily a criticism, we were tourists too) but that probably says something. We went relatively early (around 6pm) and waited 45 minutes without knowing that people could just sit at the bar or outside if seats were available. The waiting process was quite haphazard and could be improved.The food was okay. I didn't think it lived up to the hype and wasn't worth the wait. It was however very cheap which may explain its popularity."
3448,9-01-2015 ,5.0,"The human factor is important in Cerveceria catalan (CC), that is if you choose the Bar. The restaurant is huge compared with the Bar, but the bar is where you find the action in CC. And we loved it. In the couple of times we visited CC, we found the local dynamics in motion. Alex orchestrating the service on the south Bar while the large bar waiter is on the north side. My wife assured me that the latter was one of the owners judging by his demeanor. I still have my doubts. He is a double chinned, friendly, talkative,""spanish only"" kind a guy who knows all the locals and readily befriend them . Most of the food served is vividly displayed, making pointing while uttering a slurred ""este"" (this, in spanish) highly effective. The Bar is a scene to behold when not obstructed by other diners. Afternoons were not very crowded as suggested by various guides. The bar waiters, standing behind the counter are buffered by the sitting customers, on high comfortable stools, by shiny glassed food display which is constantly tended to. On the south side Tapas dishes include various salads (like sea food, mushrooms etc.) Herrings, pickled sardins, various crockets and sandwiches and more. A beer tap is also fitted on the far side. On the North side, raw squids, sardines and octopi are displayed side by side with cheeses and meats, some skewered some coated. One must enjoy seeing what he is eating to enjoy dining on the bar of the CC. The south side Tapas is more traditional then the north side,that is, in my opinion. Freshly deep fried baby squids served from the north side taken together with cold local beer served from the tap are a killer. you can choose tapas from both sides no matter where you are sitting. Watching the locals helped us choose what to eat and most of it was great. The seafood salad, a hit among locals, is a bit salty for me. The Jamon was excellent. The patats bravas, a common Tapas in spain is not the best I had. I think CC excel in the pickled and fresh sea food Tapas. The constant chatter between the bar waiters and local clientele was a great past time during our meal. We observed the locals who come in for a quick Cortado cafe as well as those who came in to dine. Some of them were intimate with the bar waiters and parted as friends. You could even fantasize you understand what is said and feel almost local. Cerveceria Catalana is more then just a good Tapas Bar, it is part of the human scene of downtown Barcelona. Notice: we did not sit in the table zone - can't comment except that it looks a bit like a modern communal hotel dining hall. The lavatories were mostly very clean. visa is accepted. Price range around 15 euro per person (for our modest needs) One time one of our Tapases was forgot."
3449,9-01-2015 ,4.0,"Great tapas joint, where you can sit down at a table as the area extends into the building , or plonk yourself in a stool at the lengthy bar, while the colder dishes tease you in. Great personal service, decently priced. The real deal if your searching for real Catalan tapas joint"
3450,9-01-2015 ,5.0,"Phenomenal!! We could not get enough of this place!!! We ate here 2 out of our 4 nights in Barcelona (unfortunately the last two nights, or we probably would have eaten here all 4!). WOW. This was our first experience with tapas, and we are so glad we chose Cerveceria Catalana. Just a short stroll from our guest house on Diagonal, it was very crowded, so we sat at the tapas bar and watched the chefs go to work! They were so helpful and friendly and tried to help me speak Spanish (although they knew perfect English) and gave us the BEST suggestions for tapas newbies. We had fantastic Sangria, which I have tried to recreate in the US with no success (please share!) and everything from salmon to shrimp, steak, patatas bravas (YUM!) and pan con tomate. Everything was so good that we could have had seconds of everything. And talk about a good deal-- we didn't spend more than $60 for the two of us with SO many choices and sangrias :) Yes, yes yes. Hope to come back someday!!"
3451,8-01-2015 ,3.0,"I went in without any reservation, luckily I was directed to a seat in less than 5 minutes of wait. I asked the server for recommendation and ultimately I picked the ""potatoes with egg"", ""stir fry asparagus with curd bacon and mushroom"" and a prawn skewer. Despite all the hype-reviews here, I thought the food was just okay. Nothing really whao me except the prawn skewer maybe. "
3452,7-01-2015 ,5.0,I had a wonderful selection of delicious tapas there! Definitely a place to visit! Be prepared to come in advance and have a long wait until will be seated.
3453,7-01-2015 ,5.0,The hustle and bustle of CC mirrors exactly the excitement and energy of this great city. Tip: get there early (by Spanish standards) have lunch before 1pm to get a table or snag a seat at either counter/bar if you can handle the noise and the occasional tourist's errant elbow. 
3454,5-01-2015 ,5.0,"We stayed at the Hostal Martinval, and they had recommended this place. We weren't sure if it'd be a tourist trap but were pleasantly surprised by the packed/happening restaurant just 10 min walk away, filled with locals. We ordered a bunch of dishes randomly and asked the waitress to suggest some local favourites. The waitress was super helpful and even came over to help me eat the grilled leeks dish properly. Everything was delicious! We especially enjoyed the egg on frites dish...we had it several other times during the trip and felt this was one of the best."
3455,3-01-2015 ,5.0,"This is my third time here over 8 years. The restaurant has maintained its excellent quality despite expanding to nearly double its original size. Food is divided between hot and cold tapas, daily specials, and larger plates. Fully recommend the Solomillo lomo, any of their seafood a la plancha, especially the langostino, if it is on the menu, the mushroom, potato foie gras dish. Very confusing to order since there are two menus ( regular and daily specials). Restaurant is very busy and popular with locals since it's open on days when most others are closed. Reasonable, it is still my favorite restaurant in Barcelona "
3456,3-01-2015 ,4.0,"As so many travellers we felt that we had to go here and have Tapas. We came for early dinner and as expected it was packed and we had to wait in the crowd. This place seems to be frequented by tourists and locals alike and it is very popular. Tapas selection is excellent and the food was very nice. Service was friendly and efficient. Try to get a seat at the bar, which in my eyes gives you a better experience."
3457,2-01-2015 ,5.0,Nice restaurant which served delicious tapas in Barcelona. You can have dinner on table (queue to book the table) or at the bar. Good Catalan ambience.
3458,2-01-2015 ,5.0,"Heard about this place froma a local friend.. Tried to go at three different times and there was always minimum 1 hr wait.. The last try was successful as it was around 6, not as busy..Food is great, fantastic variety, very fast service, and the best part is it's great value!"
3459,1-01-2015 ,4.0,"Tapas is a wrong place for a vegetarian, but had to go there when in Spain. Was in Barcelona for 4 nights and this place was very close to the hotel I was staying at. I speak no Spanish, was given a English menu and the vegetarian options on the menu was almost non-existent, but the bar-tender who spoke no English still managed to make me leave with a full tummy :-) Had a salad which came with slices of bread rubbed with olive oil, fried/steamed green peppers with a hint of salt on the top, asparagus and potatoes bravas and not to mention 3 glasses of house red wine :-) With tips included was around 25 Euros. All the food suggestions were made by the bar-tender taking into consideration my vegetarian restrictions which was very good service indeed. Note that this place is always crowded, so be patient to get a seat at the bar or a table."
3460,1-01-2015 ,5.0,"Actually, our aim was to dine in Ciudad Condal on our first night in Barcelona but due to the wrong address given we could not manage to find it. But by chance we found its sister restaurant Cerveseria Catalana. Although it was quite early for dinner (around 5 pm), all tables were occupied so we had to wait 10 minutes. After this 10 minutes exploring the menu, the feast had begun! We had Greek salad (3.85 €), crispy camembert cheese (2.95 €), patatas bravas (3.95€), tortilla patatas (3.95 €), beef tenderloin montaditos (3.95 €) and ½ liter sangria (9.50 €). There was not a single plate that we did not like. With each bite we were saying “That is great!”, “Wonderful”, “Oh my God!”. One serve for each tapas was enough to feed two people. We really enjoyed our dinner at Cerveseria Catalana and had a great start for our Barcelona trip. Highly recommended!"
3461,31-12-2014 ,5.0,"Best Tapas in town. Busy place but worth it. Try the Prawns, clams and shrimp. Calamari was just ok but rest were great."
3462,30-12-2014 ,5.0,"This restaurant had been recommended by a Spanish friend. The dishes were many, fresh and delicious. One not to be missed.Try to get there before 6:30pm or you will have to wait for a table, particularly if you wish an internal table."
3463,29-12-2014 ,4.0,"Nice place, very good service and delicious tapas (food). Had to wait an hour to get a table, though."
3464,29-12-2014 ,4.0,"Many tourists. Go earlier if don't want to wait in the queue.Many seafood selections, pork sandwich, fried squids is good."
3465,22-12-2014 ,5.0,"Tapas place I want to make revisit. You get good service, especially if you order a bottle of cava, sit on the counter. Place is in the noisy street, but it just disappears as you start eating. We had marvelous waiter, kept the bottle in cool and filled the classes as needed. Took us long time to finish our tapas. Prices we less than expected, tapas as well cavas. Don't take table if want to have typical fuss (as we wanted). Just place yourself on counter and keep tasting good tapas. Maybe on summer I would sit outside? If the food isn't most excellent, take this place as reference and compare to others you visit in barcelona. I'll absolutely go back to this Cerveceria Catalana on my next visit to Barcelona."
3466,16-12-2014 ,3.0,"We don't know what the fuss is about. In our opinion, Cerveceria Catalana is a bit of a tourist trap; mediocre food, at a fair price though. We went to Taller de Tapas afterwards."
3467,14-12-2014 ,5.0,"Tapas was on my mind when I arrived in Barcelona for Holiday. Later on I asked the Reception at the hostel, where I can have the best tapas in town and they told me to visit Catalana. Because it was only 10 minutes walk from the hostel, me and couple of friends decided to give it a try. It was amazingly amazing. my favorites was the fried anchovies, fried green chillies and clams not to mention their perfect house wine. When the bill came we quite surprised because it wasn't expensive as we thought it would. THE BEST !!!!"
3468,13-12-2014 ,4.0,"My wife and I ate here twice. The food was very good, the service was prompt and professional but the atmosphere is similar to eating in a tornado. The place is huge and most tables seemed to be occupied for less that an hour meaning the staff are constantly coming and going. I looked at some of the negative reviews on this site and I can't say we encountered any of the problems mentioned. Is this the best tapas place in Barcelona, probably not but it is certainly worth a visit. We also thought the prices were quite reasonable"
3469,11-12-2014 ,4.0,Great tapas. We went to around 8 different ones and came back to this one 3 times. The last 2 at the bar which was the most fun. Better service sitting at the bar. VERY popular with locals and tourists...Have the razor clams and the white anchovies I love them...
3470,11-12-2014 ,5.0,"The tapas is delicious, the atmosphere is good, prices are very fair. A place to experience. You might have to wait to get a table."
3471,11-12-2014 ,5.0,I tried a few other places during my stay which were all good but I think this is the best of all. Thanks for excellent tapas.
3472,10-12-2014 ,5.0,"Whenever I have friends visiting or I feel like eating quality reasonably priced tapas I go to Cervecería Catalana. It is opened non stop but if you go at the Spanish lunch or dinner times be ready to queue, waiting is worthy though. You can only book if you are minimum 8-10 people. There is baby chair and changing room. I strongly recommend any kind of octopus montadito, the artichoke omelette, the fried camembert, any fried fish and the Catalan custard! Salut!"
3473,10-12-2014 ,5.0,"This restaurant was highly recommended to us by one of the locals we met in Barcelona. We were warned that there is usually a long wait for a table at night. We were lucky that we arrived relative early so we got a table right the way. When we came out there was a long line up. Obviously a lot of people know about this restaurant. We ordered a variety of tapas recommended by the waiter. They were excellent, especially the mushrooms with ham, the beef tenderloin and the grilled cuttlefish. The prawns skewers were also excellent even though they were a touch gritty because the veins were not removed. The service was a bit rushed due to the crowd but the food was so good that i would gladly go back anytime."
3474,9-12-2014 ,5.0,Really enjoyed everything at this place. The pine nut camembert with jam was my favorite. The fried squids were also excellent. I wish I had more time there to try every thing they have!
3475,9-12-2014 ,5.0,"My husband and I went there 2 times and we loved the food. The prawns were perfect. They have a dish of fried potatoes and eggs and hot tomato sauce that is very very good, I tried not to like it but couldn't.The service was very good the 2 times, they work really hard.Some people say the place is a tourist trap, but it is not fair, you find tourists and people from Barcelona alike because the food is brilliant.Some times it seems crowded, but give it a try and give you name to the hostess. We did it last time and she called us in 10 minutes.For dessert do not order the ""crema catalana"", it was the only thing we didn't like, tasteless."
3476,8-12-2014 ,4.0,"Dined here several years ago and the food was out of this world - before anything was in English for the tourists. It has expanded, good food, blasé attitude of wait staff. If your looking for authentic tapas experience, look elsewhere."
3477,7-12-2014 ,4.0,"...of tapas. Reasonable prices and quick service. We were there off rush hours and did not have to wait before being seated. What we had was simply very good and I would not hesitate to come back. While you are there, why not visit Locavore just across the street. Good shop for Catalan ecological food, beer and wine."
3478,6-12-2014 ,5.0,These were the best tapas i have eaten in the city! Truly delicious. Don't miss the huevos cabreaos and the montadito 4 quesos! 
3479,6-12-2014 ,5.0,"When visiting Barcelona from Dec 1-4 we did have dinner at Cerveceria Catalana based ( yes yes ) on the recommendation of a very friendly taxi driver. When arriving at 22:30 the place was packed, but we got seats at the bar near the entrance. Having enjoyed a variety of very good and nicely presented food served by smiling staff we left with a smile as well.......good experience and correct price. "
3480,6-12-2014 ,5.0,"Found about this place in TripAdvisor and decided to give it a try. This is the smartest thing I could do that day. This place deserves it's high rating.As they don't do reservations you must be there before 19h in order to be seated without waiting. Otherwise the place gets packed to its limit and you definitely have to wait at least 30 mins. But once you found a place all you have to worry is do you have enough space is your belly. The food is amazing - they have about 30 different kinds of tapas (hot and cold), a decent selection of wines and beers and some very good deserts. Be sure to try their pulpo (octopus), as it's DELICIOUS!! It's served on a wooden plate with sweet potatoes puree and some hot paprika powder. Just amazing! Other things I've tried: eggplant with sweet papers and grilled goat cheese on top and grilled green hot papers. Both were fantastic. I also ordered some tomato bread which I saw everybody's ordering. And boy, it was a blast! My friend tries the fois gras but said it's not good. The thing itself has been delicious but it's not real fois gras but rather a liver pastet or something. Some of the customers around us ordered a meal (didn't get the name) of potatoes and eggs. Was rather something like a salad. The little fried fishes were also at almost each table so they must have been good too. The sangria was also very good. What wandered me the most was the desert. I had the homemade cake with crem caramel on top as my friend had the coconut cake. Both were just delicious. I really highly recommend this place. This was the best dinner in my life so far! Wish I checked this place earlier!"
3481,6-12-2014 ,3.0,"We went here because of the great reviews, and the Tapas were excellent. Good selection, especially of seafood. White anchovies were excellent, as were the froi gras with blue cheese small sandwiches. Wine served at the bar were all very drinkable. Prices were quite in line with other Tapas bars but food is better. It gets very busy so be prepared to wait if not there early. However, the staff was a downer. We connected that they all must have been given notice, or wages cut. They were not unfriendly, but they wre definitely not friendly even to people who were obviously known to them by name."
3482,5-12-2014 ,4.0,"Was in Barcelona with a colleague and found address on Tripadvisor . We took a cab to get there = very convenient. They do not take reservations . A lady take's your name and says what the queuing time will be but seats at the bar can be taken when available . We chose the bar , good view , quick service . Menu in English if you want .......or the waiters make suggestions without abuse . He advised us to temper our greediness and order after we had eaten our first choices :-)Large choice of good tapas , wine by the glass or bottle . One can ask a ""doggy bag "" . A winner ."
3483,5-12-2014 ,5.0,"didn't have time to wait for a table, so took couple of tapas from the bar. And those were amazing! Next time I'll make sure that I have time to wait to get a table, food looked delicious."
3484,4-12-2014 ,5.0,"This place has it all. Great staff, ambiance and above all, cuisine. We had by far the best filet mignon tapa here. Best beef of the entire trip to Spain. This is great for tourists and locals as well. It gets very crowded so get your name on the list early. Aside from the beef, the other tapas were amazing as well, and this place is great for vegetarians. "
3485,3-12-2014 ,3.0,Good food but a big queue. It's a very good restaurant where you can eat the some tipical tasty tapas but the problem is that you cannot make a reservation. You arrive give your name a you have to wait aprox 30-40' for table.
3486,3-12-2014 ,4.0,"I went with my family for lunch a few days ago and simply loved it! Although we had to wait about 20 minutes (we arrived there around 14:00 on a Friday) it was well worth it. Los huevos cabreados were delicious, so were the pulpitos, croquetas, pinchos de solomillo, tapas with pork & scallops!!! The petit gateaux for dessert was a perfect way to end the meal. The Rosé wine & the different beers were also very nice. Strongly recommend it!!"
3487,2-12-2014 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to me by a colleague who lives in Barcelona. According to him, it's a favorite for lunch for people who work in the area. We could see why, the food quality was top notch, the service quick and courteous, and the vibe pleasant and professional.Lunch for 2 will run 30 to 50 euros. Ours was 35 euros, and covered bread, 5 tapes, 2 beers, 1 cava, and 2 coffees to finish. Up at the front by the entrace are two bars with heaps of food on the counter. One side has seafood, the other has veggie stuff. You can sit at the bar and do your tapes like in a sushi joint, just point and you'll get a plate. Or you can sit at a table and order from the menu. Our Spanish was limited so we just guessed and tried a few items. It was all excellent. Bathrooms we clean, and the decor very modern. Highly recommended overall."
3488,1-12-2014 ,2.0,"The food is quite nice and very vibrant environment at late night, great place for supper! However, the service is extremely horrible, donno if that is a Spain thing or what, they are not really good at English and yet not willing to listen carefully. Killed my mood with their deadly attitude. "
3489,30-11-2014 ,2.0,"Nice food, but very poor service.The waiters Are very rude. Not friendly at all.We ordered the assorted tapas platter and the cabernos. It was very nice. The fried small fish was average. "
3490,29-11-2014 ,5.0,"Went here our first evening in Barcelona- jet lag and all! Gave our name to the hostess and was told about an hour wait - for 2 persons! Walked around the block and checked back after 40 minutes and they took us in. Crowded and full of tourists, but the food was truly delicious! Ordered a small bottle of Cava and an assortment of tapas (get the fried potatoes with the egg on top- wow!) and dessert. A bit pricy for tapas, but so glad we went."
3491,26-11-2014 ,5.0,"Interesting place to share Tapas with Friends, the Sangria is tasty, it can get crowded make sure you go early"
3492,26-11-2014 ,3.0,"This place was recommended by my travel agent. I then looked on all the sites and saw raving reviews. I was unimpressed. We ordered the assorted tapas plate and some side of potatoes. The tapas were ok. The potatoes were good. However, I found nothing to be outstanding at all. I will say it was our first meal in Barcelona. So perhaps my palette is just not adjusted to the cuisine. "
3493,25-11-2014 ,3.0,The tapas menu was fish/seafood heavy which wasn't great as I am allergic to seafood. So this limited the choice of tapas. Some portions of tapas are very small and not enough to share and others are great for sharing which makes it difficult to choose. However saying that the quality of food was delicious and we had a lovely meal.
3494,25-11-2014 ,5.0,"We went as a group of 6, we all ordered different items and got a great experience. The place was trendy, the help spoke enough English for us, and the food was great. Try the ""small fried fish"". The prices were reasonable and there were outside tables if you wanted. It was very close to ""La Rambla""."
3495,24-11-2014 ,5.0,"may choices, delicious dishes, I loved this restaurant! the Jamon was my favorite dish! the waiters always responded quickly and friendly."
3496,23-11-2014 ,4.0,We went here on our first night in Barcelona. Was extremely crowded but was lucky that there was a no show for a table of 5. Service was good and atmosphere was great. The assortment of tapas were very good. Try the mushrooms and asparagus tapas - perfect.
3497,22-11-2014 ,5.0,"Very nice place to spend your evening. Try to get hold of a place at the bar. You can't make a reservation, nut normally within a half of an hour you can get a table. The quality of the food is amazing. The best tapas of Barcelona. Staff is great and willing to tell what to eat and explain the menucard. Ambiance is great. At the bar you easily get contact with the other guests, which we think is very nice, in our case they suggested us what to eat.jidt amazing"
3498,20-11-2014 ,5.0,"This is the place to go for tapas in Barcelona. It's really popular and they don't take reservations so be early if you want a table without having to wait for 2 hours. The food is great and the wine and beer selection is really good. I strongly recommend the mini hamburger, the Fois gras sandwich and the deep fried baby squid. "
3499,20-11-2014 ,5.0,"Excellent quality of food , great service .. Noel at the bar was a delight he made our evening one of the best in a week in Barcelona with the great wine recommendations and the tapas he brought to us. It was like he read my mind and knew what I like and wanted . Definitely going back for more . The best place for tapas in Barcelona !!"
3500,19-11-2014 ,4.0,"We went on a Monday when I said ""no-one will be there"". All the other restaurants in the locality were completely dead. How wrong I was, when we arrived at about 9.45pm the place was buzzing and we were told there would be a 1.25 hour wait which after a large beer (this is a Cerveceria after all!) evaporated into 30 minutes. Some very good tapas and a very good Crema Catalana and Chocolate pudding for dessert. My only gripes would be the calamares were quite chewy and the gambas al ajillo small and disappointing to the extent that I also ordered the skewered fried prawns which were much bigger, better and a third of the price! The bread based tapas (sobrasada, chorizo) and the Russian salad were all very tasty. Would definitely come back again but would know to order better next time! Also don't forget a good selection of beers available from across Europe (Kriek, Franziskaner, London Pride...). Total meal came to 70 Euro which given the number of tapas we consumed I thought was very reasonable."
3501,18-11-2014 ,5.0,"Not fair to call this a cerveceria, it has some of the finest and most diverse food items I have ever seen in one location. It is also open in the afternoon and early evening, where almost no restaurant in Spain opens before 7:30 or later. Terrific calamari, cuttlefish served three ways, great coffee and fantastic desserts. My wife and I shared 6 small plates, 2 desserts, 2 coffees and a bottle of fine wine for under 60 euros. If I lived nearby, I would eat there weekly!"
3502,17-11-2014 ,5.0,"After reading the Trip Advisor recommendation, we got to the restaurant,A warm welcome, we ordered a wide variety of tapas, each dish more delicious than the last,Culinary experience - highly recommended.One of the best in town"
3503,17-11-2014 ,5.0,"if you want to experience best tapas bar at a reasonable price in Barcelona, go to this place (gone twice in 5 days). Make sure you try their bravas potatoes and cream brulee (my favourite)."
3504,16-11-2014 ,4.0,"On business in Barcelona, we ended up eating lunch here and I loved every bite. Tapas were very tasty, especially the asado topped with salted padron peppers. Excellent and wide selection of both seafood and meats. Worth the wait!"
3505,16-11-2014 ,5.0,"Everything is delicious(with the exception of the ptatas bravas, which are not crispy or tender enough) Very fresh seafood , veggies grilled or fried. Wonderful white sangria! Inventive consistent tapas!"
3506,16-11-2014 ,5.0,"As tourists who only speak English, I was impressed with how accommodating the staff was. We had a fairly large group (7) and kept ordering tapa after tapa ... everything was delicious!"
3507,16-11-2014 ,4.0,"Even with the long wait and it was late for us, the place was full packed at 11PM and we waited and grad out seat and oh, it is worth the wait. All the tapas we ordered were superb to the palette and the wallet.I can come back again."
3508,15-11-2014 ,4.0,"We came recommended to this place. Tapas were great. We came at 7 and it was perfect. By the time we left there was a long wait so come early. We had the Russian salad, filet, shrimp, and fried anchovies. The eggplant with red pepper and goat cheese was superb!! Service was good as was the ambience. Seating is indoor and outdoor. Very reasonable prices. "
3509,15-11-2014 ,5.0,"While this is quite a touristic restaurant, the quality of the food and the price/value of the different tapas, make it a most in Barcelona for a good old fashioned lunch.Quality is very very high, and is the reason that a lot of Catalans and tourist alike keep this place always packed."
3510,13-11-2014 ,5.0,"Top quality, really good service and really caring people. We (me, my wife and my two kids) had dinner outside, although november was really hot. Paid about 80 € but worth it. A must-do in Barcelona..."
3511,13-11-2014 ,5.0,"We ate here during our stay and it was great!! Excellent food, not very expensive. Overall a great experience and definitely recommended."
3512,12-11-2014 ,5.0,"This is always a great meal. Great value and friendly service. You do have to usually wait for a table, but that means that lots of people like it! They are a bit of an institution. I always like to order a little bit, and then keep ordering food as I see (otherwise you might over-order food.) Their bottles of wine are very well priced. I have taken dozens of people who visit us in Barcelona and everyone has always loved it. It's not a special occasion type of place, a more casual thing, but if you are in Barcelona you HAVE to go here at least once...you'll likely want to return within your same trip, most everyone that goes there goes back."
3513,11-11-2014 ,4.0,"One of the most well known tapas bars in Barcelona. Very crowded even after 22.00. We arrived at 20.30 and had to wait approx 40 min to be seated. Best experience would be at the bar where you have the best view on the action and the guests. The food is very good. They serve a wide range of tapas, meat, veggies and seafood. Portions are a bit large for two though. So we didn't finish all. But overall a great experience and definitely recommended. If this place is too crowded you can also try Ciudad Condal. Same owner, same food. But usually crowded as well."
3514,11-11-2014 ,5.0,"We ate here as a recommendation from a Spanish friend - and boy was it good!!Great food, cheap, great choice and good price.Off the beaten track and away from tourist which made this the perfect place for tapas!!"
3515,11-11-2014 ,4.0,"I have eaten here five or so times. The food never disappointed. Many refers to their food as ""the best tapas in town"". Can't argue that. Great atmosphere, but almost all tourists. Not that it's a bad thing, we were tourists too. Almost the entire staff is Philippino appearing. Again, not a bad thing. They speak several languages and it comes handy. At the bar they are very busy, not the most attentive, so be assertive, make eye contact and wave them down. The place is packed during dinner time. Wait time can be over an hour. One may sit at the bar without the wait list, but combat rules apply. Be EXTREMELY cautious with your belongings! Not just because the signs say so, but because the threat is real. I grabbed a Moroccan's hand trying to lift my passport and my phone. They work in groups and pretty smooth. This orpahange kid and former military wasn't born last night, so nothing was lost. Their sandwiches during the morning hours and lunch time are amazing. Enjoy!"
3516,10-11-2014 ,5.0,"I like authentic, local restaurants, and usually avoid modern fancy looking tapas place. Cerveceria Catalana totally changed my perception! The food was just amazing!Recommend:Grilled prawnsGrilled Razor ClamsDuck breast and foie gras skewer with caramelized appleGrilled sardinesAsk for recommendations and daily menu (only available in Spanish)."
3517,10-11-2014 ,4.0,"Lovely food. It was really busy when we arrived but even busier when we left! There's a good selection of tapas.The only flaw would be that the service isn't consistent with all staff. Some were lovely, others not so friendly. I would recommend the chocolate cake if you like something rich."
3518,9-11-2014 ,4.0,"Been there several times.Food is always very good, the service solid and the atmosphere energetic.Take your time when going there since you can't reserve a table and will have to wait a bit when coming after 8 pm."
3519,8-11-2014 ,4.0,"We had eaten here twice on our last visit to Barcelona in 2008. This is a large restaurant with sometimes long waits for a table. The menu is extensive, the staff is helpful and the food is delicious. We especially loved the razor clams and marinated white sardines. Lots of wines to match. "
3520,8-11-2014 ,1.0,"Beware of shrimp skewers, like a chemical like ammonia, not me claiming ate and quickly, I rushed to the kitchen. after they charged me.INCREDIBLE Prawns beware of this restaurant before eating, should smell with the nose and ask if they notice something strong book claims."
3521,8-11-2014 ,5.0,"Worth the extended wait - enjoy a wine or beer in packed lobby or out by sidewalk tables while you wait. Vibrant atmosphere, fast, excellent service, very good menu selections (all tapas). Highly recommend the combo/variety plates. Food quality seemed outstanding to me.Could not tell if tourist or local hot spot - probably both by looks and sounds of those clambering to eat there...Excellent choice by my Son for our dinner together."
3522,6-11-2014 ,5.0,Highly recommended by our hotel. Tapas was delicious enjoyed the patatas bravas with the spicy tomato dip with chicken and ham croquettes amongst some of the dishes. Well priced and quality very high. The wine selections complimented the dishes superbly.
3523,6-11-2014 ,2.0,Tapas and beer of average quality and high price specially aimed at tourists. I`d look for other more authentic places!
3524,5-11-2014 ,4.0,"First thing is first! Make sure to order padron peppers... Then depending on your liking; tapas, tapas and more tapas! Iberico should not be forgotten as well as pan con tomate! Beer or wine would do! No reservations, need to queue but it's worth it! "
3525,4-11-2014 ,4.0,"Just got back from Barcelona. Went to this restaurant, because it was the best restaurant i ate, when we were in Barcelona a couple of years ago. The food was still great. The service is ok, but can be a lot better. Some waitresses dont seem to be happy that your eating at their restaurant. Its not annoying, but I love waitresses that seem to like their work. But I dont need them to make my evening. We had a great evening, with great tapas. Would go there any time I visit Barcelona. "
3526,4-11-2014 ,5.0,"Yeah ok there is a huge line and the waiting time is 30 min for lunch and 45-60 minutes for dinner but it is worth it. And just a tip instead of waiting for a table get yourself some seats at the bar. It is whoever is faster gets the chair but better to eat there seeing what you order.We ate there lunch and dinner. Everyday they have a different tapas of the day menu. It is great to show, point what you want. Or you can ask a waiter what is the thing they are carrying :) It is a must eat place in Barcelona for tapas. The staff is very friendly and trying to help you understand all those spanish"" special of the day"" menu. You must go and try the beef sirloin, the white fish with tomoto (i have no idea what the name is as the couple next to us told me to taste it, i loved it and just pointed out) the next time we just said the fish with tomate we ate before and the guy somehow understood us. The mini burger is also very nice. When you sit get up and take a look at the other bar also. 1 bar has mostly sea food the other has all the rest.remembering all the good food I ate while writing this is amazing. You MUST try this place.And the prices are very good. As 3 friend, we ate, we drink a bottle of wine or 1lt sangria plus dessert and paid 60eur total.Amazing!!!!!"
3527,3-11-2014 ,5.0,"My wife and I visited Cerveceria Catalana having read about in in a rough guide on our first night in Barcelona and ended up calling in every other day of our stay. The bar is a traditional (but modern) tapas bar at the front and tapas restaurant at the rear. On our arrival (early evening) the place was packed with both locals and tourists and we were told that the wait for a table in the restaurant area would be about 50 mins. However, after a couple of minutes into our first drink we manages to get 2 stools at the front seafood/meat tapas bar counter (and as it happened if we had of waited for a table the wait would only have been 15 minutes). There are two counters facing each other, the other had plates of cold food and salads although anything on the menu, including that served in the restaurant area can be ordered from either bar counter - I mention this as we had only intended staying for a short while but were seduced by the food displays and ended up staying all night and eating copious amounts of tapas, washed down by 2 bottles of fabulous cava. Of particular note was the calamari (the most amazing I've ever had) various iterations of prawns (cooked in a way I can never achieve) and the best of all, beef tenders (fillet beef on a very thin slice of toasted french bread topped with a small chilly pepper - had 4 of these - unbelievable for what you pay). The bar remained busy throughout the night with a great atmosphere and fantastic staff. Total cost for the evening was about €60. I've been to more traditional tapas bars across Spain but this is by far the best. Well worth seeking out and we'll definitely be back!"
3528,3-11-2014 ,4.0,"Go there for the food quality and nothing else! It's not a very pleasant experience, the staff doesn't care much, it's noisy and crowded... But the tapas is very, very good, food domes out fast and tastes great, it's all very traditional but the items taste good and the portions are large. "
3529,3-11-2014 ,5.0,"After not getting in last night, we tried it for lunch. At 1:15, we were the last to get a table before the waiting list started. Attractive decor, large selection, reasonable prices, good quality food and efficient service make this a restaurant to return to. "
3530,2-11-2014 ,5.0,I've been to Barcelona three times and I always return to this Tapas bar/restaurant in Barcelona. You must try the Huevos Cabreados.
3531,2-11-2014 ,5.0,"Very good choice for delicious local tapas if you don't mind waiting for a table. Central location, value for money. "
3532,31-10-2014 ,5.0,We ate here twice during our week in Barcelona. The service was excellent. The food was excellent! It was a lovely place to meet new people.
3533,31-10-2014 ,5.0,The menu offers something for everyone I came here on three different occasion during my visit to Barcelona. My friend and I enjoyed all of the tapas and the sangrias. great customer service and atmosphere
3534,31-10-2014 ,5.0,This is one of my favorites restaurants around the world. Delicious food and quick service. Reasonable prices.
3535,31-10-2014 ,4.0,"Based on a tip by friends we walked in, got a table rapidly and found nothing to complain about. Good tapas, modern and buzzing place with good service. Yes it is slightly more expensive than your local bar but worth it. "
3536,30-10-2014 ,4.0,"Pretty exhausted on our first evening in Barcelona (after a nearly sleepless overnight flight from the US), we elected to head straight to two seats that were newly vacated at the bar rather than waiting in the already substantial line for a table--and we were not at all sorry that we did. Many of the tapas options were beautifully displayed before us, and the informality of the bar allowed us take a close look at what others were enjoying (this led us to include in our order a particularly tasty melange of wild mushrooms, asparagus, and ham). Our server was patient and helpful, and in spite of being kept constantly in motion filling tapas orders and pouring wine, always seemed in good cheer. It was a plus for us that the restaurant was only a few blocks from our hotel on the Passeig de Gracia."
3537,30-10-2014 ,3.0,"We went there after a recommendation to eat tapas in this restaurant.We were waiting to sit for 20 minutes and nobody came to ask if we need something.. Anyway,, after finally sitting we figure out that food was average and the service was really slow...Dont recommended for an amazing meal"
3538,30-10-2014 ,5.0,"Okay, I can't say 'the best', but they sure were good. The service was fast and the waiters friendly. Excellent experience. Just avoid the shellfish."
3539,30-10-2014 ,5.0,"This is a very busy place, for a reason. The food is fresh and tasty and there is a massive variety. The staff are friendly and accommodating. I'd advise going to the front of the queue to book a table, as many people queue thinking its for a table but it's just people waiting to be called for their reservation. If you are prepared to wait at the bar its a free for all to get a chair and part of the game really. This is relatively easy for couples but becomes more difficult for larger groups. "
3540,29-10-2014 ,2.0,"Cerveceria Catalana (judging by the locals -beside the tourist- crowds) must be some sort of a hype , slightly poser ,""place to be"" ,especially for channel/gucci/LV heavily armed ladies that enjoy a glass of wine during their shopping marathon.The whole area actually is shouting elegance and certainly one of the nicest district that Barcelona has to offer .Despite the the insanely big waiting list we managed to sit a small table outside after waiting 15 or so minutes and served by a grumpy waiter.Inside was atmospheric but almost constantly had so many people eating,shouting and pushing each other while waitresses trying to balance plates with tapas and montaduras above their heads. We have decided to have a quick bite and fly giving the option to other couples waiting silently outside for their turn .Three plates including baby octopus (not chewable),baby hot dogs as tapas (!), and pork souvlaki in a meat-on-a-stick combo with the last one and only to be ok.Plus 1/2 ltr. of Sangria we have paid almost 60 EUR to the anxious waiter, in order to clean up the table even when we are still sitting, for the next set of victims.I guess Tripadvisor should start an ""I have told you so"" shortlist for these places.So keep walking..."
3541,27-10-2014 ,4.0,"I visited this restaurant by a recommendation from the hotel staff. Went for a lunch but saw the big crowd outside so went back again for the dinner.Arrived there around 7, put our name on the list and waited for a loooong time. We got in around 8:20 so we stood there for over an hour. There is a bar in which you can order drinks and tapas while you wait. Some people finished their dinner there but we didn't want to eat behind the hungry crowd staring at our food so we stayed as the hungry crowd. Hall staffs were very nice and helpful. We wanted dishes that were not on the menu (or at least not on the English menu), and although we do not speak a word of Spanish, they tried their best in delivering our needs. We had about 7 tapas, 0.5 litres of sangria, plate of dessert and a cup of coffee for 59 euros. I'd say it is very reasonably priced for the atmosphere and the service you get.The tapas were pretty good, not the best I'd imagined, but very nice for the occasion. I'd always thought Spanish tapas to be bit more saltier, to go well with alcohol, but the tapas here were not as solid as we hoped. Still it was very good so I guess it is up to an individual's taste bud. Would I go here again? Probably not, but would I recommend this restaurant? Definitely Yes. "
3542,26-10-2014 ,5.0,We were recommended this tapas restaurant by friends who visited Barcelona last year. They were spot on. It was fabulous. We arrived at 6:45 & had to wait no more than 10 minutes for a table. Everything we ordered was simply delicious. Fabulous chills White wine slipped down a treat too. Worth a visit & worth waiting for a table. 
3543,26-10-2014 ,5.0,Really nice tapas place and not expensive. But the place is popular and chaotic during peak hours so I recommend going weekday lunches to avoid irritation.
3544,25-10-2014 ,3.0,"I expected a long queue, since it features in all guidebooks, which was fine, though the staff underestimated our waiting time. The food is nothing spectacular, but the service good."
3545,24-10-2014 ,5.0,"There's always a line to get in but don't worry, it goes by realy quickly. The service was fast and the food is great. Very interesting selection. Sangria was great."
3546,24-10-2014 ,4.0,Be prepared to grab a stool at the bar - there are many waiting with you. It gets really crowded in the bar area so if you are prepared to wait longer place your name for a table. Daily selections are offered with usual tapas selections available. Handy location on the Ramblas.
3547,24-10-2014 ,5.0,"My gf and I were looking for a bit of relax and a snack after visiting Casa Batlo and la Pedrera. TA suggested us this touristy place and we were not disappointed. Great staff who speaks good English, stylish furniture and mouth watering dishes. We sit at the bar on the right, awesome location, but you can sit in front of the hot tapas on the left or at regular tables on the back. We had the pulpos a la gallega which is one of the best things I have ever eaten, it literally melts in the mouth, and ficus with mozzarella and ham plus two beers. Bill a bit on the high side at 15 for a snack but definitely worth it. "
3548,23-10-2014 ,5.0,"The first time went here we went as guests of our friends, who are local Catalonians. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed but well worth the wait. They ordered for the table--round mini-omelettes, potatoes bravas, razor clams, fried squid and a plate of lightly fried small peppers called padrons. We washed it down with the local beer. Since we were staying in an apartment in the neighborhood, we found ourselves there again--this time in the evening. We wanted to sit at the tapas bar but it was too crowded so we took a table for two in the huge dining room. Our waiter spoke enough English to explain some of the dishes and we focused on seafood. We had the red pepper stuffed with cod puree, Russian salad, a saute of mixed mushrooms. thin crispy ham and onions, marinated seafood salad and a pile of tiny fish (anchovies? sardines?, smelt?) lightly breaded and flash fried. They were hot and salty and when we squeezed a lemon over them they were heavenly. We had an inexpensive bottle of chilled dry rose, which was a perfect match for the wide variety of dishes. We also split one bread based tapa consisting of duck breast and a nice slice of duck liver in a wine sauce. We skipped the mini burgers and hot dogs (though they must be popular as we saw them on most waiters trays as they went around the room), and never seemed to have room for dessert. If I had one complaint, it was the seafood salad--in addition to tasty shrimp and mussels, it had quite a bit of surimi--the imitation crab stick cut into tiny pieces. I was surprised to find this fake seafood in such an authentic place and would definitely have paid a bit more for real crab. But everything else was great and it's a lively spot beloved by locals and tourists alike. Try to score an outside table if you can."
3549,23-10-2014 ,5.0,"We traveled to Barcelona on October 2014, we looked for a true Tapas place, this is the place,the staff is OK and most of them can handle English, we used Google translate for the recommended menu which was a small piece of paper only in Spanish.the Sangeria is very strong and good, almost all of the dishes were great.the price wasn't bad 60 Euros for a couple including drinks and dessert.Warning - you can't reserve a place and there are 2 lines - 1 for inside - took us an hour to wait - we came back 2 days later and again waited for an hour...the second line is first come first served which is the bar.overall a great restaurant - enjoy"
3550,22-10-2014 ,5.0,"My wife and I were in Barcelona for 6 nights and on the recommendation from our airbnb landlord we went to Catalana for lunch one afternoon, we had tapas, the mini burgers and hot dogs, and bacon and cheese baguette. everything was delicious and the service was great as was the price. we liked it so much we went for dinner the next night. Do yourself a favor and eat at catalana. The place is always busy with locals which is a good sign."
3551,21-10-2014 ,4.0,"This restaurant is always busy with locals which is always a very good sign. The staff is very attentive and the food is served promptly. The size of the plates vary but the taste is always great. I would recommend that you try the tapas of the day, which are listed in a separate paper which is given to you together with the menu....they seem to be of larger portions than the tapas on the menu."
3552,21-10-2014 ,5.0,"This is a ""must"" place if you want to feel local vibes and tastes - the best seafood tapas downtown in a traditional arrangement full of locals and tourists - do not miss the tuna pinchos and the bacalao with the red pepper - tip: go as early as possible for fast service - after 20:00 it becomes full and queues are usual "
3553,20-10-2014 ,4.0,Visited this restaurant several times over our 5 day visist to Barcelona. It was very convenient to our hotel and very popular with 45 to 60 minute waits at 8PM dinner hour. This tapas restaurant was always busier than any adjacent places so it appears to have a good following. We went off hours to avoid the long wait times. Very nice place with some outdoor seating. Tapas were good but I would have to say did not really justify the obvious popularity of the tapas restaurant. Food and wine pricing seem ed fair compared to other places.
3554,20-10-2014 ,4.0,"Such good food and eating outside in the morning is heavenly, with a view of Catalunya and La Rambla. Such a good breakfast and beautiful coffee and hot chocolate too."
3555,19-10-2014 ,4.0,"Ate here on Saturday night just after 6. Good food, nice prices. Definitely can see why people recommend it. Try and get here early as they don't take reservations. Would recommend this place and would eat here again if in the city."
3556,19-10-2014 ,5.0,"Great tapas for a good price. Long wait as it is busy but quick turnaround and worth the wait. Had the peppers, mini steak burger, hot dog and hamburger with Spanish Omelette, prawns a la plancha and others with a bottle of wine for 60 euros! Great night out for a quick bite of food. "
3557,19-10-2014 ,4.0,"When we came it was so packed, we thought of passing, luckily we stayed and waited by the bar. We got two seats in 10Min. Food is fresh, the place was crowded the entire time. Nice service but low English, very good tapas dishes. Better for seafood lovers. "
3558,18-10-2014 ,4.0,Went twice and will definitely will go back on my next visit to the great city of Barcelona. Busy and crowed but the food is great and all the severs are helpful and nice.
3559,18-10-2014 ,4.0,"Good tapas. Must try to the 'croquetas'!! Be prepared to wait, but don't be discouraged! It's worth it."
3560,17-10-2014 ,5.0,"On our first night in Barcelona the hotel recommended this restaurant, but it was late, there was a long wait, and we were tired, so we went to another, and promptly forgot where Cerveceria Catalana was. On our last day, a cab driver said ""If you want the best tapas in the city, go to the restaurant on the next block from here."" We went later, and it was our ""missing"" recommendation from the hotel. Armed with two recommendations we happily waited an hour, and it was more than worth it. Clearly the best tapas we had in our stay, and we don't skimp on our dining. Good wine list, fresh food prepared well, unique combinations and fast service (They really turn tables, so I don't know if I'd go for a leisurely evening.) If we had eaten there on our first night, I'm sure we would have returned several times."
3561,17-10-2014 ,4.0,"This was recommended by several sources, and it was a good choice. We were able to get a table at 7 PM, but when we left at 8:30, there were lines waiting to get in. There is a choice of two tapas bars or seating at tables in their large dining room. There is a large and varied menu plus daily tapas selections. We loved the beef sliders, crabmeat salad, warm red peppers with eggplant topped with goat cheese, and grilled octopus. We had eaten at their sister restaurant the day before which had the same menu. I would have been disappointed, but the menu is so large and the ambiance is different that it was fine."
3562,17-10-2014 ,5.0,"Recommended by a friend & we went back 3 times! great food - buzzing atmosphere.. We didn't have a reservation so we waited for a spot at the bar twice, another time we sat outside.. the staff are always pushed as it seems this place is very popular but it is so worth it!the crispy camembert, fried small fish, prawn skewers & cured ham with tomato bread were our favourite dishes, with a jug of sangria obviously... I'd go back for dinner tonight if I was there!"
3563,16-10-2014 ,5.0,Was recommended by the hotel to go to this restaurant and it was great. Two of us arrived approx 7pm on a Monday night and it was packed....was told we would be waiting 40 mins for a table. Luckily we got a seat at the bar and didn't have to wait that long.Being at the bar we were able to see the food (it's all on the counter in front of you) and order by pointing at what we wanted from the Tapas menu. The choice is huge and we struggled to get through half of what was on offer but each dish was lovely.Prices were pretty much OK also.The staff were very friendly and looked after us well. Check this restaurant out if you are nearby!
3564,16-10-2014 ,5.0,"We have visited Cerveceria Catalana off and on since 2009. Year in and year out the tapas are superb. The selection is over the top - both on the menu, as well as from the 2 ""bars"" that line the entry to the restaurant. You can order from anyplace. Not sure what time they close - perhaps never. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I was recently there at 12:45 AM and people were still floating in. Amazing. The late night crowd is young, polished and more local. Expect wait if you arrive anytime after 7:00 or so. The restaurant is large with seating inside and out, but the place seems to be jammed with diners around the clock. A one and a half hour wait is not unusual but oh so worth it. The wait staff is excellent, particularly given the pace of serving this many people each and every day. Fun, attractive, and you see everything from very casual attire to quite dressy. Clearly popular spot for dates and groups of friends after work. Love this place - can't wait to go back."
3565,16-10-2014 ,5.0,"We happened to be at this restaurant on October 12 - the National Day of Spain and (it so happened this year) Canadian Thanksgiving. The Spanish holiday meant it was PACKED. There were people waiting in line, people stuffed in at the bar, and people hovering around just waiting to pounce on an open seat. We didn't mind the wait however, because it was a noisy fun space. We put in our names with the staff, but before they called us we got two seats at the very end of the bar looking down along the dishes of food. Perfect! With very little Spanish, this meant we could point and nod at the food we wanted to try. We sat and had a variety of salads, seafood and meats, along with beer and sangria. It was especially celebratory because it was also our Thanksgiving dinner. I would recommend sitting at the bar at least once even if tables are available. It's fun to watch the servers work and the food go in and out of the kitchen pass-through. The sangria packs a punch but it's really good. I enjoyed all the food and the atmosphere so much - I would say it was the best meal I had in Spain. Cheers!"
3566,15-10-2014 ,5.0,I have been meaning to write this review for some time. We were here in May and by a long shot it was our favourite place in the city. Due to the excellent food and the friendliest staff we ended up visiting 3 times. We felt so welcome we ended up watching the last game of the la liga season with the staff and the locals (even though we have no interest in football). Highly recommend it.
3567,15-10-2014 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by friends and by our guidebook and it did not disappoint us in any way. We even liked it that much that we went twice during our 3-day stay in Barcelona. It is a big restaurant where they can serve many people at the same time, but it is well organized and the staff is efficient and quick. The menu is full of great food and most items are small snacks or tapas so you can try many different ones. The wine list was good as well and although the restaurant was busy you still had your privacy. All the food we tried (different things on both nights) was well presented and had good flavors. We started with only a few dishes and kept on ordering afterwards which seemed to be a normal way of doing it. Both evenings we went around 6/7pm and when we left there was a long queue so if you are in a rush this might not be your best option from 8pm on, although your patience will definitely be rewarded! I would directly go back to this restaurant during a next visit to this city!"
3568,14-10-2014 ,4.0,"Unless you go early, be prepared to wait for a spot by hovering over anyone looking like they may be close to leaving. Lots of locals mixed with tourists from all over. Linger at one of the two bars instead of at a table so you can soak up the energy and point to whatever tapa may catch your eye. Maybe the best tapas we have had in Barcelona, and with friendly and quick service."
3569,14-10-2014 ,5.0,Well worth a visit even if you can't book in advance. The food tasted fantastic and there was a lot of choices. Quick service despite the restaurant was crowded. Priceworthy and a good wine list.
3570,14-10-2014 ,5.0,"Great variety of tapas! They have a regular menu and daily specials. We went early and it filled up quickly, so if u want to go later please make reservations. Great service and a fun and delicious tapa experience. Waiters were friendly and great recommendations. Don't leave Barcelona without a tapas experience"
3571,14-10-2014 ,5.0,"My husband has traveled to Barcelona many times and always comes here. You will not be disappointed. My suggestion is to go around 5:00-6:00, otherwise you will be standing in line waiting for over an hour. In Barcelona it is common to eat dinner late at night so getting there in the ""off"" time is perfect. The Sangria is fantastic-both red and white. We loved it so much we went back two nights in a row! Tapas is wonderful because you can try so many different dishes. The fried calamari tentacles were great.Try the fried potatoes, anchovies (which usually I am not a fan) but they are not like here in the US. The best to me was the razor clams!! To die for. I had them both nights. There are two counters loaded with food to pick from. You can sit at the counter and just point to what you want to try next. A MUST while in Barcelona!!"
3572,14-10-2014 ,5.0,"Recommended from a European traveler...It just so happened our hotel was stumbling distance....amazing assortment of tapas....it is very busy...so reservations recommended...we were lucky and arrived to a 1 hr. wait...but happened to get a bar seat (first come, first serve)as someone was leaving....definitely worth the stop! Fish assortment of tapas was wonderful!"
3573,13-10-2014 ,5.0,"Be prepared to cue up for this wonderful restaurant to which many local also go. Or make reservations in time so you don't have to wait. But when you are lucky enough to get a table, you will be in for a wonderful experience. Best tapas we have had in Barcelona, and with friendly and quick service also!"
3574,13-10-2014 ,5.0,The best food in the world. Best Service.nice design of the restaurant .The potatoes is perfect !!! Enjoy the mood there 
3575,12-10-2014 ,1.0,"After reading the reviews on trip advisor my friend and I decided to eat here for the first night of a trip away, it was not a great experience. Firstly they insisted on giving us a huge selection, after informing them we couldn't eat certain foods they reluctantly gave us a menu for the tapas. Then when the food came the meatballs were cold and the patas bravas can only be described as Mcains wedges with garlic mayo. The drinks came in cans and we got charged €40 for this experience. Then to top it off on leaving I asked if there was a toilet to use and it was locked off, I finally got in and the toilet seat was damaged, it looked unclean throughout and there was no soap. Then I was given the key to put back in the kitchen.I would highly recommend to stay away from here and visit some of the more popular Tapas restaurants. The location of this restaurant makes it seem it is of high quality but would never visit againBrendan, Manchester "
3576,11-10-2014 ,5.0,Stumbled across this place at lunchtime mid week. The place was packed out. We got a spot at the bar but were lucky. A lot of people were waiting for tables but the wait didn't seem too long. Food was fantastic. Loads of choice and lots of tapas. This place is a definite must!!
3577,10-10-2014 ,5.0,We stopped in about 5:15 for a light meal & really enjoyed it. No trouble getting a table at that time. We had the appetizer sampler (surtido de tapas) & a lovely Verdejo from Rueda for about 30€ & really enjoyed it. The food & service were both excellent.
3578,9-10-2014 ,4.0,"We went here on our first night as we had read in many different places it was a must-visit restaurant in Barcelona. We had to put our name on a list and come back after an hour as it was so popular, but it was definitely worth it for the delicious food and great service."
3579,9-10-2014 ,4.0,"Good quality tapas. Place is packed when we as a party of 2 shows up for lunch at 1:30pm. Put down a name and waited probably 20 for a table. Excellent food, quick service. Can't read or speak much Spanish and they got no English menu but server quickly gave us a run down and translation of some items on the menu. She also told us we could select tapas items from the bar and just tell counter person it's for table __. But we decided not to bother as it was pretty crowded around the bar.Ordered some prawns, patata bravas, baby octopus, beef tenderloin, etc. seafood items were good but surprisingly I find more enjoyment with the patata. Next table were Spanish and sure know they ordered, which all appeared very good, especially some mushroom dish. Should have got mushrooms as well."
3580,9-10-2014 ,5.0,"We stayed in Barcelona for a week and came here twice for evening meals because it was so good. There was a queue out of the door both times, and the first time we went we were told to go for a walk and come back in 25 minutes. Don't be put off by the wait as it is well worth it!Definitely try the Montaditios: we had the prawns on skewers and Camembert on our second visit. They were delicious! The best prawns I've ever had! The Camembert came covered in peanuts and with jam on top- an odd combination, but it was so moreish! The hot chocolate cake and creme de Catalana are to die for!The service was very quick and the staff very helpful.Not to be missed!"
3581,9-10-2014 ,5.0,"Another recommendation by our hotel, backed up by our some trip advisor research. They don't take bookings, we arrived at 8.20pm and had a 40min wait (then got lucky as someone was called and wasn't there). There is a bar area to wait it and the staff are very friendly. The food is excellent (the best we've had all week) and very reasonably priced. The wall of different beers from around the world is excellent. Will definitely return on future visits to Barcelona!"
3582,8-10-2014 ,5.0,"We come back to this place every time in Barcelona. The quality remains on top. You have to get used to the waitress style, but you wont regret because of the food. Go and eat here!"
3583,7-10-2014 ,5.0,"Been this place three times and always had to wait for ages to get a table. This time I was lucky to get in without waiting at early lunch time. Ordered 8 dishes for myself, just can't resist the amazing delicious food. Service was quick and food was so fresh and yummy. Spent almost an hour there try to get everything into my stomach. Loved it and will come again. "
3584,6-10-2014 ,5.0,"We went one night and there was a hour and half wait, so we went the next night early, at 7 and got a table. We asked the waiter to select some tapas for us and after asking our tastes (I also have a shellfish allergy....poor me) he came up with some amazing dishes. All dishes were beautifully presented and all amazingly good. No wonder there is a line up. Would highly recommend."
3585,6-10-2014 ,5.0,"This was my fourth visit to Barcelona and ended up going to this restaurant twice for lunch over the weekend.Sat at the bar, food was awesome, service was great, and the atmosphere made it a memorable experience. Would recommend to all and will definitely visit again. "
3586,6-10-2014 ,5.0,"Came here for tapas on the first night of our honeymoon. Located right by our Hotel Balmes, Cerveceria Catalana was THE best choice for tapas. It was a Saturday night and of course it was crowded, but we waited by the bar, split a bottle of cava, and as soon as a young couple was finished with their meal, they offered their seats to us, and the manager even helped us into our chairs. We ordered some of the best sangria I have ever tasted.  The young couple before us ordered what I would say was a drum of foie gras and potatoes with caramelized onions and so we knew that would be the first thing we HAD to try. Luckily, we did because it still makes my mouth water to this day. We asked the waiter to bring us his picks at the tapas bar and we were more than satisfied with his choices.  I can't wait to come back to Barcelona if only to enjoy tapas at this excellent locations."
3587,6-10-2014 ,5.0,Simply the best in Barcelona. There's long lines but it's worth it. There's a 2 hour limit per table
3588,4-10-2014 ,5.0,"This place is deservedly busy, be prepared to wait - no bookings. Cracking fresh seafood, very professional staff, dishes arrive randomly but for a tapas place this is fine, good value wines too, desserts excellent. All great value."
3589,4-10-2014 ,5.0,"Barcelona, and Catalonia in general, are not known for their tapas. The tapas bars you find here are mostly set up for tourists, who expect to find this, since we are in Spain (right?).That said, and knowing that nowhere in Barcelona you will find the incredible tapas that you would find in other parts of Spain, La cervecería catalana is a fine place to have a glimpse at what you may find in other parts of Spain. Everything is very good here, although not very imaginative.You cannot make a reservation, so you can just ask at the desk for a table, and wait for an average 40min during the week at night. Have never tried the weekend, but you may have a longer wait.Anyway, the food is worth the wait. And you can have a glass of wine or sangria at the bar while you wait for your table."
3590,3-10-2014 ,5.0,"came on our last nite in barcelona (from 3 nite stay). delish!!!! fresh food!! omg, it was amazing. yes, very very crowded at nite. and i know why....we got very lucky that as we waited in line to check with hostess, 2 girls at bar right behind us were leaving, so we got seated right away. the service was fast & friendly. we got very good recommendations- as we wanted to try what was typical of barcelona & spanish life. i even got recommendation for a souvenir idea. we ordered: montadito 4 cheese, cold prawns, fried anchioves andaluz style, red pepper stuffed with cod puree, a special tapa (a fried flower), brava potatoes, spanish omelette. and, of course, half jarron of sangria. all for $40 euros. everything perfectly cooked; nothing was greasy, salty, over/under cooked.obviously, i did not try a huge array of spanish restaurants in 2 days so im no expert in spanish cuisine. I've gone to several spanish restaurants in nyc, none as tasty or fresh as cerveceria. actually, after having had cerveceria the spanish food here no longer attracts me. if this was a tourist trap, then its helluva a good one. "
3591,3-10-2014 ,3.0,"Arrive after 2000 and you can queue. It seems to be mentioned in every guide-book, you hear all sorts of languages. Food is average. As there are so many and partly smaller tapas places, I would skip this one. Service was pretty slow, both at lunch and dinner."
3592,2-10-2014 ,3.0,"A recommendation for Tapas frequented by tourists early and locals later. Tried it for a ""late lunch - early dinner"" and was seated immediately. The place had a tired look with slightly worn furniture. The drinks were far better than the tapas which were average to taste but presented nicely."
3593,30-09-2014 ,3.0,"Good food but too many people . It's a bit pricey and service is relatively slow . Good location . Try ""flauta del dia"""
3594,30-09-2014 ,5.0,We were recommended this place by our hotel. It is crowded so be prepared to wait for your seat at the bar or come early. The tapas are the best ever. We just asked the wait staff to bring us their favourites and had the best night in barcelona. Staff are amazing and the atmosphere unforgettable. Must do if in barcelona. We went back again and ere just as delighted.
3595,30-09-2014 ,5.0,"best and most tapas in BCN, if you wanna have good innovative and really fresh tapas at anytime in BCN this is the place to be.... don't miss it"
3596,30-09-2014 ,5.0,"The tapas placed was full when we arrived and had to wait approximately 30minutes to be seated.It worthed every minute of the wait. The tapas were really great and tasty, The service was excellent. The price was fair for the amount of food consumed and the quality.*Do not forget to order the fries with eggs plate."
3597,30-09-2014 ,4.0,"Splendid place for Tapas . It's not cheap but you'll eat quality stuff and well cooked. Just a point to have in mind: be patient, it's usually very crowded, you can't reserve in advance. So when you get there , give your name and wait for your turn. First come first served."
3598,30-09-2014 ,4.0,"I like this place, but I have to say that is always full of people and of course, noisy. Anyway, you must try it!."
3599,30-09-2014 ,5.0,"In Barcelona, when I see a place crowded with internationals (as opposed to locals) it is typically a red flag. However, sometimes its simply because its so good that nobody wants to miss it on their trip! I highly recommend Cerveceria Catalana for a meal where you want to sit down at a formal table (as opposed to the many tapas places where you either stand or get thrown temporarily at a table). With that comes a long wait (sometimes up to 2 hours) - a) its worth it, b) its Barcelona just go find a drink somewhere.We ordered rounds of Sangria and (probably) around 7 tapas for 4 people. This was plenty. The tapas were very good, large, and reasonably priced. Although in Barcelona I'm usually not looking for this type of sit down - I love this place and will definitely be back!"
3600,29-09-2014 ,5.0,This restaurant is recommanded by the people in the hostel we stayed. We went there on the first day for dinner and it was the best meal we had during our stay in Barcelona. I am sure it is not the best restaurant in the city because my friend and I were on budget so we couldnt go to anywhere that is more expensive. We spent 46euros for two person which is including a whole bottle of white wine and it was great as well.
3601,29-09-2014 ,5.0,"Loved how busy it was. Get there an hour early, put your name in and grab a cocktail at outside cafe around corner and relax. Waiter did an amazing job ordering for us and explaining what he recommended. excellent price."
3602,29-09-2014 ,5.0,"A Barcelona must try!! It was amazing! Quick service great prices, good wine and amazing cava! Every person's dream meal to start off a great night in Barcelona!"
3603,28-09-2014 ,4.0,"Very good option for a quick brunch. I wouldn't choose it for dinner, cause it's getting too packed and noisy and you rarely get the chance to hit a free table - a long waiting list will welcome you at the door :) The menu is nothing special - most classic tapas, salads and poor assortiment of grilled meat. Products are fresh and therefore it's tasty, but I couldn't say anything was ""wow!"" Anyways, I would come back for a grilled baguette and coffee."
3604,28-09-2014 ,5.0,"Everything, great choice, superb food, friendly staff, not too long a wait, reasonable for the supreme qualityUnmissable"
3605,28-09-2014 ,5.0,"Restaurant open continuously 9 am to 1 in the morning,Modern unpretentious style.Good atmosphere.Delicious tapas. Freshly cooked to order. Also some delicious deserts.Drinks very reasonably priced. Wine available by the glass.There's a beer menu offering example quality beers from many countries.Menus available in various languages.Aiming for high quality mainstream accessible experience. Achieving it! Probably faultless.Doesn't take bookings. At some times (particularly weekends and after 6/7pm can be very busy and you have to queue and put your name down."
3606,27-09-2014 ,5.0,"This place was extremely crowded at 730 when we wanted to get in. That being said, this was one of the best tapas place that we went to in Spain. The food was amazing. It is all very unique, and very delicious. The prices were extremely reasonable for the location and how busy it was! A local took us to this place, and it was definitely worth it!"
3607,26-09-2014 ,4.0,"We had an early dinner there and were able to sit outside. The tapas were delicious, reasonably priced, and the service was good. It was an easy walk from Casa Battlo and then back to our hotel on Las Ramblas. I highly recommend it!"
3608,26-09-2014 ,4.0,"We were lucky to arrive early and sat at the bar. We could see the variety of seafood and order what we wanted. We also sat next to 2 groups of tourists, both have been there second and third time, so we knew it was going to be good. Octopus and shrimps, and arroz negro were very nice. We went back for dinner sat at a large table, but the service was not attentive as they are always busy. Expect to wait for a table, it is often busy with tourists and locals."
3609,25-09-2014 ,5.0,"Best place in Barcelona to eat Tapas! I would reccomend it to anyone! Nice place, nice design, very nice staff, and tapas are sublime, and a very good wine selection. surely I'll go there any time I'll be in Barcelona!"
3610,25-09-2014 ,5.0,"While traveling in Spain we went to Cerveceria Catalana on a tip from a local in Barcelona.Without question the best meal we had during out trip to Spain, Italy, and France. Yes its crowded and yes you will probably wait for a table but its well worth it. The wait gets longer as the evening gets later so go early if you can. The tapas selection was typical but very well executed. The potatoes with the garlic aoli was my favorite followed by the four cheese kabob with jam.Don't miss this place!"
3611,24-09-2014 ,4.0,"Was recommended to us by a local friend, both time we went before the crowd so have no issue getting a table, the food was tasty, especially the little tiny squid/octopus, just go over to the front and pick whatever you want to eat instead of just pick it based on words :P service was so so, been there twice and sometime they do forget your order and you would have to remind them."
3612,24-09-2014 ,1.0,"Whe were recommended to this place by our hotel receptionist. I read the reviews and was a bit cautious. When we arrived, it was total chaos. Lots of people outside, but no real queue. I found out that there was a separate waitress taking a waiting list for the outside tables and another for the inside. They gave us an estimate of 60mins (the time was 20.30). You could wait outside like the rest. They were shouting out first names and if you weren't there, you've missed your place. Well, finally we were seated and ordered two ""assorted tapas"". We got one plate. Mediocre in our opinion, 15,95€. When I checked if this really was one or two portions, the answer was one. I thought let's just pay the bill and get out of here."
3613,24-09-2014 ,4.0,"I showed up with a friend for a late lunch, 3 pm, but normal for Barcelona, to find a line up! Had heard so many good things about this tapas restaurant, that we decided to wait it out, and boy oh boy am I happy we did! Food was excellent, fresh and delicious. Servers were efficient and friendly, and the restaurant itself was clean and had a lovely ambience. We ordered a selection of tapas (from the daily menu and classic menu), all very tasty. To accompany our tapas, we ordered the sangria de cava which was a total delight and I highly recommend it! Very good value for money, especially if you compare to other ""renowned"" tapas bars around the city where you pay about the same but where the quality is far inferior to the Cerveceria Catalana. For two of us, we spent about 60 euro, which is more than acceptable for the quality you get back! This place is now on my preferred short list of Barcelona restaurants and I will be sure to return! Ah yes, I forgot to mention its location, just off the Rambla Catalunya, centrally positioned but far enough away from the craziness of the Ramblas. All in all, I cannot think of a better way to spend a Sunday afternoon in beautiful Barcelona!"
3614,23-09-2014 ,1.0,"Service was rushed, food was mediocre, calamari was inedible. Went did we wait 80 minutes for a table? Because the previous record suggested it would be great, that's why. Well they are wrong and there are many better places in the neighborhood (Pepita...). Avoid this place like the chewy squid they serve. "
3615,23-09-2014 ,3.0,"We waited for an hour for a table, which we were expecting. Got a table underneath a very strong light which were in our, and the guests at the table next to us', eyes, creating a very unromantic atmosphere. We had about 5 different waiters during the dinner, all very stressed, however friendly, and didn't connect with the customers. We ordered food from both the daily menu and the ordinary menu. Food came quickly. The food didn't feel freshly cooked, especially the fried dishes. They were luke warm and rubbery. Bread was dry. We might have ordered all the wrong things from the menu, but the dishes we got were nothing special. House wine was alright, and the bill didn't end up being too expensive. After being recommended this place by several friends we felt underwhelmed and slightly disappointed. The stressy Barcelona tapas vibe can definitely be charming if it's done in the right way, like at Tapas 24 - however here it felt like a fast food restaurant."
3616,23-09-2014 ,3.0,"Yep...we did! on our first night in Barcelona...It was full house!!! and it was only 7:30 pm...it got worse as we left around 9 pm...they do not take reservations, so keep that in mind...It is your typical tapas restaurant/bar...with all the traditional offerings on hand...It was fine...service was good...waiters were not very pleasant...they seemed edgy and unhappy...We had to move carefully as our chairs touched those behind us...We came, we ate, we left...the impression we got was normal...nothing special...We ate at other places the following days, and they all offered pretty much the same...The Spanish ham is to die for...here...and anywhere...Brief..it is a good place but not somewhere I would go back..I would want to try others...no question..."
3617,23-09-2014 ,5.0,"One of the best tapas places in Barcelona, and right down the street from our hotel! Be prepared to wait, but well-worth it, even to my wait-averse husband. On our first visit, a bilingual family helped us navigate the extensive menu of tapas (the menu translations are somewhat sketchy) and invited us to share some of theirs. Some waitstaff are bilingual as well so you don't have to depend on the kindness of strangers -- although that is easy to do in Barcelona!We returned twice more to try some things we had seen on neighboring tables as well as having some of our original choices again -- and again. Great tastes, great variety, great buzz. Loved it! "
3618,23-09-2014 ,5.0,"There is a reason you might have to wait for a table and why our local tour guide strongly recommended this upscale tapas Mecca! At the end of two weeks and 5 cities in Spain, I can honestly say this place has the best potatas bravas, garlic shrimp, beef filet and pork loin sandwich with carmelized onions and red peppers. Yum!"
3619,22-09-2014 ,5.0,"The best restaurante for ""Tapas"". Expect to wait 45 minutes for a table at lunch but you can eat and drink at the balcony while you wait. The service is fast and the food is excellent."
3620,22-09-2014 ,4.0,"Long line to get in to this small and very crowded Tapas place. Not very good seating and pretty stressful place. Tapas are displayed on plates on bar desk and you point on what you want (language problem?). No seafood was displayed, although shown on signs outside!? Special meny? Food was OK, but there are many better Tapas places!"
3621,21-09-2014 ,5.0,I have lived in Spain and tried many restaurants and tapas places and have to say this place was sooo good that I went back 3 times in 5 days :-) Was there April/May 2013
3622,20-09-2014 ,1.0,"Like Public Enemy said, ""Don't believe the hype"".I ignored the few bad reviews and saved a visit here for my last night in BC. Arriving as early as 6:30pm I still had to put my name on a list but enjoyed relaxing with a beer and chatting with others outside. Once being called through it all went down hill! The service was at best, poor and I put that down to two things - being a solo diner and the shift change that happened about 7:30pm. Although given a menu, I had to borrow the Tapas de Dai menu from another table, the waitress spilled my wine while pouring the first glass, dishes I ordered weren't available (but not offered an alternative) and I was constantly asked if I wanted a coffee and the bill! I felt hurried to order, pay and leave and undervalued when I saw how other servers were interacting with larger groups. So, after just 40 minutes of being sat down and with half a bottle of wine still to drink, I asked for the bill and left! With it being such a large canteen style venue, I think it is pot luck on whether you get a server who cares about the customers or alternatively, don't eat by yourself. As for the food, very ordinary! There are places not very far away that serve better quality food, without the wait and far far better service!"
3623,19-09-2014 ,5.0,Great place with a good variety of tapas. Fresh materials and reasonable prices. Very popular with locals. No reservations so there's a line during busy times
3624,19-09-2014 ,5.0,"Excellent food, served extremely swiftly. This establishment clearly thrives on serving as many diners as possible. You normally have to wait for a table but we were told it would be a 45-minute to one-hour wait, and in fact we were seated in 35 minutes. So it pays to come back early! We really enjoyed all the tapas, especially the red peppers with cod puree. The house wine is very good value and excellent quality."
3625,19-09-2014 ,4.0,"Tapas restaurant suggested by friends who had lived in Barcelona.The restaurant doesn't take reservations and can be very busy at lunch or dinner. We (2 adults) arrived around 7PM for dinner and were seated immediately at a ""sharing table.""The service and tapas choices were very good -- boiled prawns and mini-burgers with onions were just great! Wee ordered 4 tapas plates and there was plenty of food for 2 adults.Prices are very reasonable - clean, neat and orderly appearance in the restaurant.Very good choice for a casual meal!!"
3626,18-09-2014 ,5.0,The tapas was wonderful once you get a table. This restaurant always seems to be busy. Staff were very helpful explaining all the options.
3627,17-09-2014 ,5.0,"Tapas tasting could be better, if there is one place you want to give tapas a try cerveceria catalana is the place to go. it can get very busy so we went around 3 pm for a late lunch and sat at the bar. "
3628,16-09-2014 ,4.0,"This place was recommended to us by one of front desk staff at our hotel. She said it was one of her favorite places and slowly started becoming more popular with tourists.We came in around 11pm and it was pretty packed! We got lucky with a table outside immediately, even though there seemed to have been a wait. It had a great vibe, the menu was pretty awesome and the prices were cheap! We had a bunch of small dishes, 5 or 6 and in addition, a few tapas from the bar.All were great actually. Not one complaint actually. Sangria was delicious as well. The service could have been much better. I can't even blame our waiter as it seemed he had every table outside and was running around frantic.Overall, one of the best meals in Barcelona hands down."
3629,16-09-2014 ,5.0,"Conveniently located near the Modernista highlights, just a short walk from Passeig de Gracia, the extensive menu offers a wide range of delicious tapas. It's a large modern restaurant, quite different from most of the tapas places we tried but the tapas were as good as any we ate elsewhere."
3630,16-09-2014 ,5.0,It's not the first time and probably not the last time we are eating in this excellent tapas var. you have to wait 30-60 minutes outside to get a table but the food the service the atmosphere worth every minute. You are surprised each time again from the variety of dishes from the speed you get them and above all from the quality!! And the price is very fair too!!! Recommended!!!
3631,16-09-2014 ,5.0,Avoid the touristy places and head to this restaurant. It's where the locals eat. Wonderful food. Great people watching. Will definitely return when I'm in Barcelona next! I love great tapas.
3632,16-09-2014 ,5.0,"We made sure we had lunch here based on the extraordinary number of reviews! The tapas were generally excellent, ambience was quite modern and the service was good too. Enjoyed the fried white fish, garlic prawns, crem catalan etc. Perhaps my bar was set very high by Paco Meralgo (see my other reviews) and/or by the number of reviews, but we were not blown away by the food as we were at PM. I won't hesitate giving a 5* ranking though, as we did enjoy the meal. A reliable option if you're around Passeig de Gracia or Placa Catalunya area."
3633,14-09-2014 ,5.0,"I tried to eat there on a sunday night, and had to give up due to the long waiting list. Came back in a weeknight and had excellent food in a nice environment."
3634,13-09-2014 ,5.0,"This place is busy, but if you're patient and just relax with a drink while you wait for a table then you won't be disappointed. Very well run service, we were advised it would be a 40 minute wait and it was only that. Patrons were spilling out onto the pavement with a drink while waiting and it was a lovely atmosphere. Once seated, we didn't feel rushed and the food and drink was fabulous. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."
3635,12-09-2014 ,5.0,"Our hotel was on C/Mallorca, so we passed this place several times and saw it was ALWAYS crowded. We figured it must be pretty good, so we decided we'd brave the crowds and try to get a table. We must have waited about 45 minutes, but when we finally got seated, out on the terrace, it was absolutely worth the wait! What they serve is standard Catalan tapas, but the difference between this place and most of the places in Spain is that that the execution is absolutely perfect! Particularly great were the cuttlefish, the razor clams, the crispy camembert, and the patatas bravas. The place is pricey, but no more so than any other sit-down dinner restaurant in Spain. But here, you get your money's worth because the food is of the highest quality. This would be the first place I went to if/when I go back to Barcelona."
3636,12-09-2014 ,5.0,My wife and I ate at the Cerveceria Catalana and liked it so much that we went back the next day to try the tapas we had not tried the first day. These are some of the tapas we tried both days:1. Bacalao llauna2. Tortilla de patatas3. Pimientos de pardon4. Calamasrcitos malagueños5. Croquetas6. Chipiron andaluza7. Ensalada griega8. Solomillo9. Esparragus y champiñonesI also had half a bottle of white wine. The average bill was 40 euros a day. This was very reasonable and not expensive. We really enjoyed the food here. The service was very good too. I will definitely go back the next time we visit Barcelona.
3637,11-09-2014 ,5.0,"This place is packed all day until midnite or later and it is worth the wait! I can't say all of the service was top drawer but it was pretty good! Try talking to the street front guy several hours before you want to eat and ask him to put you on his list then come back. Second trick would be to hang around the service end of the bar waiting for stools to empty and pounce. We met loads of good folks doing the latter. All the food was fabulous, fresh and dont let the wine prices fool you - there's good juice here!"
3638,11-09-2014 ,4.0,"A great place to go on our first night in Barcelona. A forty minute wait, which we passed by walking. When we arrived back at CC, they sat us immediately and we had Sangria and our first tapas within five minutes. It was fun trying several different items. After a long wait to be seated, it was nice to have food and drinks so quickly! Good service, without feeling rushed. Overall, a great experience."
3639,10-09-2014 ,4.0,"My friends and I ate here twice in our three day stay. The food was always fabulous and the service was good. However we encountered an interesting issue on our second visit. Only because we had been in the restaurant the day before did we realize that some of the same tapas that we had ordered when the restaurant had been very busy were now being served (during a slower time of day) with much larger serving sizes. The grilled mushroom tapas were three times as much in our second day serving, and the ice cream for dessert was also three times larger than the day before. I would never had known this without going there twice. It was a little disappointing. But the food was so good that I would certainly recommend it and go again."
3640,9-09-2014 ,3.0,"We went here as recommended online and also looked greatWe arrived at 830(early for Barcelona) and put our name down for 930. We came back at 915 and the waitress refused to call us to a table and let Spanish people in first despite many requests as to our location in the queue .Eventually we were seated about 1015. Waiters barely spoke to usI understand our language is not theirs but there was no nonverbal communication to welcome us, it seemed the priority was to get us out.  Food was ok except we were served raw hamburgers ( which were replaced) and fish that seemed a bit off. We had a good time as we had good company and we had wanted to check out this place, but other tapas places are much much better!!"
3641,8-09-2014 ,3.0,"Having walked past this restaurant a few times and seen people queuing for tables, and having also had a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at, we decided it was worth a try. There was a good selection of tapas on the menu - however, on the night we were there a number of items were not available. Highlights were the tomato bread and beef tenderloin. Food was good value, but I think there are better places for tapas if you go off the tourist trail (also recommend la boqueria (market) for tapas style items)."
3642,8-09-2014 ,4.0,"We visited Cerveceria Catalana for lunch. When we first arrived we were a bit afraid of how busy it was and if we would ever get a table. We gave our name and the hostess informed that we had ~20min waiting list. We waited outside as the food looked really good and didn’t want to leave. Well, after 5 min she came out to call us as a table become available! We ordered several tapas and they were all super good, particularly the black rice. The waiter made a mistake with the octopus we ordered as they have 3 or 4 different types, but we were happy with the dish anyway. We also had a good jar of sangria, not the best in town but good enough for lunch (I find it always difficult to judge on a good sangria!) and they have also good wines selection. There is a large selection of dessert to choose from. There are tables outside but as it is so busy can be difficult to be seated outside. Service was fast and prices are average for tapas. Agreed that sometimes can feel like a robot chain type of restaurant and can be very noisy as it is super busy so I won’t recommend it for dinner if you want to enjoy a romantic dinner but for a lunch is perfect. I will definitely go back."
3643,7-09-2014 ,4.0,"We visited this restaurant on recommandation of a family member. When visiting this place, you always have to wait to get a table, but once you receive your tapas, you all forget about the waiting time. Nice and good tapas, served in the typical Barcelonean style. Unfortunately we sat on a table close to the bar and kitchen, which gave us a rushed feeling, this in combination with the hasty and robotic service. "
3644,6-09-2014 ,3.0,"Got seated to a table rather quickly considering how busy it was, the host was friendly and accommodated myself and a friend as we are trying to learn Spanish. The server was the exact opposite, was very brusque and impatient. All the fried fish was missing from the menu. The food was good, highlights being the beef tenderloin and the grilled cuttlefish. It was a cheap eat as well considering how much we ordered! It was an ok place but absolutely doesn't live up to the hype. Also note that this is a chain, including Ciudad Condal and, I've heard, Mas o Menos. However as I didn't go there I can't vouch for the latter."
3645,6-09-2014 ,5.0,Enjoyed everything we ordered. Good service. We were initially told about 45 minute wait as the place was really busy. Pleasantly surprised and seated in about 10-15 minutes.
3646,5-09-2014 ,5.0,Not only was the food exceptional but the service was amazing!! Dont let the crowd put you off this institutional place. We had the black rice and fried calamari that was out of this world!!
3647,5-09-2014 ,5.0,"Read a review on this place by Jamie Oliver so decided to check it out. We sat at the bar for lunch which is a great spot as you can point to what tapas or larger plates you would like to eat; luckily we arrived early at about 12.30pm; by 1pm the place was packed with loads of people waiting at the door to get inside - so come early. The food was fantastic, huge variety and not that expensive - 2 glasses of Rose (only 2 euro/glass!!), 1 fresh OJ, 2 coffees and 6 dishes came to just under 30 euros. Plates/tapas we choose were both hot and cold. Friendly staff. Highly recommended. You can eat at the bar, out on the pavement or out back where there's lots and lots of tables."
3648,5-09-2014 ,4.0,"Touristic restaurant but with a good reason because it is delicious!It was really crowded so I had my name written on a list and could come back in 45 minutes.At that time, we had nearly immediately our table and went for lots of tapas.Even though it is crowded and maybe a bit too touristic, I would really go back to taste some more!"
3649,3-09-2014 ,5.0,"Came here to celebrate my girlfriends birthday, as we expected (during high season) we came down and left our names and were told that there was around a 1 and half hour wait, and that we should pop back and check. We came back around an hour later and were seated, the beauty of this is the quality of the food and variety of flavours that come with this. Although, as with most tapas, the portions were small, we ordered around 12 different dishes and left extremely satisfied!"
3650,2-09-2014 ,5.0,"The people who are ""Disappointed"" with this restaurant are crazy.The line was always long, but worth the wait (slow down, you're on vacation). We went during lunch, it was easier to get in. The food was on point, quite tasty, and came out at an awesome pace. Octopus, 4-cheese bread... everything was awesome, so tasty.The Sangria was fantastic. A couple next to us ordered too much, so they gave us half a pitcher. 1.5 pitchers between two guys was the start of an excellent Sunday! Specifically, the Sangria is lighter (vs. heavy) than others I had in Barcelona, quite refreshing!"
3651,2-09-2014 ,5.0,"Excellent food, service, atmosphere(full up to the brim every single night of the week) and prices. I am used to higher prices in Barcelona, but this little Cerveceria impressed me. The only ""problem"" is that you will have to wait an hour to be seated, but it's worth it. Just have a beer(they have good draught of Estrella) outside and a cigarette and with good company, time passes by quickly!"
3652,1-09-2014 ,4.0,First night of our holiday in Barcelona and we may well be back. Waited a while for a table but not as long as we were initially told. Worth the wait though. Had a varied selection from the menu and everything was spot on. The prawn skewers were the best prawns we've had!Thoroughly recommend this great restaurant with a brilliant atmosphere. 
3653,1-09-2014 ,1.0,"Having read the reviews, I was really looking forward to some fantastic tapas on my last night in Barcelona...I was so disappointed. The service was poor, the waiters distracted and the tapas was average at best. I would not recommend this restaurant, there are better tapas bars away from the obviously fashionista areas."
3654,1-09-2014 ,5.0,"My group was looking for a place to eat early, we headed there about 5:30 PM on a weekday. This was a recommendation for Tapas from a local person at a convention we attended. Good thing we got there early the place was packed and people were waiting by the time we left around 7:30. They have categories like salads, tapas etc. and at the end of each section there is a sampler plate. We ordered the sampler plate from each section and a few mini cheeseburgers. They were all phenomenal. If I lived here this would be a place I go regularly. We also ordered the cake sampler plate for dessert. Everything was delicious and we are happy with our choice. The various wines we selected were all wonderful. Even the area that the restaurant is in is very European. Great place to take a stroll after dinner. Lots of activity and energy. I don't know if it was authentic tapas but everything was fresh and delicious."
3655,1-09-2014 ,4.0,"The best tapas tasted in Barcelona!Though you have at least an hour wait it is definitly worth it.The service once you sit down is fast, though not the most friendly it is true.Definitly a must when visiting Bcn."
3656,31-08-2014 ,5.0,"We stayed in Barcelona 4 days, but after having our first meal in this place (following a recommendation from our hotel at Passieg de Gracia) we ended up eating here at least once a day. Why?The atmosphere is fantastic. There are plenty of locals, some tourists, the food is displayed very nicely on the counters. We did not even bother waiting for a table and preferred eating at 'the bar' (recommend this) so we had a better view as to what we would like to order.The food is full of flavours and really tasty. Sure, this may be because we were travelling from London (and after eating in Barcelona realised the food in the UK is simply poor) and did not have a wide conparison of local restaurants. But nevertheless, we do go to some fancy restaurants here and there and in terms of taste and flavour this place (especially seafood) was beating any London establishment (including Dorchester where food is good, but comes at exorbent price).The staff is able to comfortably speak English and is both helpful and fun. One of the days we indicated we are in for a quick fix meal as we are off to Sagrada Familia (you have not seen Barcelona if you do not visit this place) and they were very quick at serving the food and letting us know what not to order as it may take longer to prepare.This place cannot be faulted. Sure, it may not be ideal for a romantic evening experience, but if you would like a taste of Barcelona try this at least one evening - it will all come at a price you will be happy to pay."
3657,29-08-2014 ,4.0,"Easily walked in and got a table for lunch at 5pm. We ordered a selection of vegetarian tapas: bravas, tortilla, roast veg stack, Camembert and the most amazing crispy potato and egg dish. The food was well cooked and unusual- really different to the other tapas we had been eating. The egg dish is an absolute must try. Overall, go if a table is available, if not, you won't be missing a huge amount. "
3658,29-08-2014 ,4.0,"This spot is lovely, on Carrer de Mallorca which is in an affluent area of the city. We were lucky enough to get a table outside- we were told we'd have to wait half an hour but were seated within 5 minutes. The menu is extensive but they have special tapas of the day and the waiters recommended how much would be adequate for the 3 of us. Prices are very reasonable, we thought it'd be far more expensive. Food is fresh, simply cooked but authentic, unlike so many of the ""tapas"" places we came across in the surrounding towns. The fried crawfish was delicious, and the green chillis with rock salt, and we had a pepper stuffed with melted cheese and I think it was some kind of crab meat? All different dishes, all delicious! We opted for sangria instead of beer but they've got a wide selection of craft beers which we'll have to try another time. Service is quick but pleasant, you can see that they're eager to turn tables but we still were able to sit over our drinks and Irish coffees without feeling like we were being turfed out. Can highly recommend!"
3659,28-08-2014 ,5.0,"Whenever we are in Barcelona, we go and eat at the Cerveceria Catalana. You'll probably have to wait to get a table because this place is always very busy but it is totally worth it.Best tapas in town, friendly service and reasonable price."
3660,27-08-2014 ,2.0,I felt like I walked into a very noisy small bar type restuarant in Melbourne. The staff was not attentive and so many were standing outside with a drink in their hand until they get seated. we go super tired of it and left to have a nice quiet romantic dinner somewhere else. I have passed it during lunch time and I felt the viber was better for lunch hour. Might checkout when i visit next time.
3661,27-08-2014 ,5.0,"Arrived close to 11pm one night. Place packed. Sign up for table... Wait dome time.Better yet, go to the bar. Where the action is, bartenders or tapatendera will suggest whats good or great and you can have as many beers as you want ina second.Tables, boring. Bar, exciting.Food excelent, fair price. A must tapa place in Barcelona to go."
3662,27-08-2014 ,5.0,"This place is crowded almost all the time. We went there around 7 and we were lucky to get a table right away but half an house later, there was a long line outside for people waiting to get seated. Food is absolutely amazing. All of the dishes we had was great. Sangria is also a must. It is close to shopping areas too ;) I'll definitely go back here. Best tapas I had during my 2 week stay is Spain!"
3663,26-08-2014 ,4.0,Nice food. Fair Price.But bit unique for the fact majority of chef and waitor/waitress are Asian.Nice location and decoration.Quite noisy but not resturant's fault.
3664,25-08-2014 ,5.0,The food was amazing! All very reasonably priced and really good cava! I would definitely recommended to others and go back! 
3665,25-08-2014 ,4.0,"Nice place, very touristy with a long line to get a table. Do not wait to get your name called go and ask about your table. It was good and staff speaks a little bit of english. "
3666,24-08-2014 ,5.0,Really enjoyed my dinner here! Went early for Barcelona (6pm) and by the time I left at 8pm it was packed with a line out the door. I sat at the bar and never felt rushed but everything I ordered came promptly. The mushrooms and asparagus were fresh and delicious. The white wine the server recommended was amazing. I'll be back!
3667,24-08-2014 ,5.0,"A friend of mine told us that this place is a must go if you are in Barcelona. We were not disappointed. I read the reviews that it is really busy and there is a long wait to get the tables. Therefore we came in at around 22:30, so that we could get the table quickly. I was wrong, we had to wait for at least 45min to get the tables. Busy restaurant is always a good sign. The food didn't disappoint at all. Everything that we tried was amazing. Right from mix tapas platter to marinated Sardines, prawn skewers, some charcuterie and some of the names that I don't even remember, everything tasted amazing. This was one place where I've eaten squid fried properly, it wasn't over cooked and chewy. Just perfectly cooked.Service was great and attentive, given the fact that they were extremely busy.Highly recommended. I would surely go back once I'm in Barcelona."
3668,24-08-2014 ,4.0,We were referred to Catalans and we're not disappointed it was great that we could see almost all the tapas as it was also a feat for the eyes !Sangria was very goo too ... Red that is !The squid in particular was awesome !
3669,23-08-2014 ,5.0,Just of the passage Garcia this is a very popular restaurant always busy when we passed so popped in as when in Barcelona 2 years ago it was great.Again not disappointed managed to get a table pretty swiftly and tuck into some great tapas.Our eldest daughter claimed the prawns in garlic were the best ever!
3670,23-08-2014 ,5.0,"This is an excellent tapas, busy and buzzing, with beautiful fresh fish and hectic service, we had a meal here 3 nights and every time the food was amazing! I absolutely love this place and judging by the queues at night so does everyone else."
3671,22-08-2014 ,5.0,excellent food and a must if you visit Barcelona....the only problem is you cannot book and sometimes you wait for 45 minutes.....but so worth waiting for....I was in Barcelona for 6 nights and ate there on 4 occasions...a must!
3672,22-08-2014 ,3.0,"A friend took us here for dinner one night and having tried many other places, this one did not feel as fresh, friendly and fun as the other tapas restaurants in Barcelona. Even though the menu was similar to others, the food just didn´t measure up: the huevos cabreaos did not taste as fresh and spicy as at other restaurants, the fish didn´t taste as good and even the baked camembert was not as fresh.Service was also somewhat slow and absent. I would rather go to some other restaurants than this one."
3673,22-08-2014 ,4.0,"When asking advice on where to eat in Barcelona, this restaurant was repeatedly mentioned. It felt right therefore to see what all the fuss was about. Me and a friend arrived about 1pm on a Sunday and found it unsurprisingly busy. We didnt have to wait long for a table though, as the venue is quite large. The menu was in English, although the long list of daily specials was not, making it a bit of a lottery for us. We started with a selection of Montaditos (crusty slices of bread with a variety of toppings), the highlight of being the crab and sweetcorn. We then had fried cuttlefish, some gambas, potatas bravas, asparagus and a plate of their sliced jamon. It was all very tasty, particularly the cuttlefish which was soft, cut in long strips with a light batter. The only disappointment was the potatas bravas which were a touch undercooked and the sauce was not spicy enough. Although it was incredibly busy the service was both quick and attentive. There was a fantastic atmosphere as family and friends got together and shared this Sunday meal, a tradition held in Spain as in England. For such a well presented restaurant it was not expensive and I can see why it is so popular. Highlighted by the line of 20 people waiting outside to get a table as we left."
3674,21-08-2014 ,4.0,"Came here expecting nothing much was pleasantly surprised by modern décor, quick service and delicious food. They were transitioning from breakfast to lunch when we came in so managed to try some dishes each from breakfast menu and lunch menu. Everything was tasty and great value, surprisingly especially as most of the dishes were seafood which can be quite expensive. Agreed with most posts that service is nothing to write home about (efficient, to the point) but didn't care much as long as they weren't downright rude."
3675,20-08-2014 ,5.0,Every time we go to Barcelona we visit this restaurante. Always something new to taste and a lot to choose beteeen. Always crowded so you have to be preperd wait a while for a table. It is worth waiting for.
3676,19-08-2014 ,3.0,We went at 2pm on recommendation of our hotel. Put our name down for 45 minute wait but did not hear name called and hostess made us wait for another 20 minutes to be seated. I was with my two hungry kids. Mean Filipino hostess. servers don't speak english and some items only in Spanish. Food was good and would go if not for bad treatment.
3677,18-08-2014 ,5.0,"Great food, friendly staff and a good price. Whilst in Barcelona for 5 days we were so impressed with Cerveceria Catalana we went back and took our friends. The food was plentiful and of good quality. Good selection of beers and wines, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpul."
3678,18-08-2014 ,5.0,"The range of tapas will suit every palate and every age group. Their specialty is Cabreosa ?something-sorry,I can't remember the rest of the name but if you ask for the Cabreosa, they will know. It's crunchy french fries with a special sauce which is slightly spicy but kids can eat it with a fried egg on top. Sounds ordinary but the sauce makes the dish come alive-never ate anything like this before. Endless dishes to order-fried baby octopus, prawns, figs with cheese,etc. Lunch starts at 1pm,go early. If you want dinner go before 7pm or by 7.30pm latest. Even at 7.30pm,the wait may be 1/2 hour. It closes at 1.30am. Our hotel was only 10 minutes walk so it was ok-we just walked back to the hotel if the wait is over 1 hour. We ate there for 5 of the 7 nights we were in Barcelona-that's why I couldn't remember the menu cos we went through most of it ! Must try the Iberian ham. If you have to wait long (after 8pm, it's 1- 2 hours wait ! ), you can buy a glass of wine from the bar or try to get a seat on the bar stool and you can start eating from there. Some of the tapas from the bar are not on the menu so you are lucky if you can get a seat on the bar. If not, look at the tapas on display at the bar and while waiting to be called to be seated, ask the waitress what the tapas you like from the bar is and she will bring it to your table. This next comment is unrelated to the restaurant but I really want to share this. Buy the Eristoff BLACK vodka from the wine/liquor shops if you are in Barcelona. It's used to make the best black mojitos and delicious by itself. It is unavailable outside of Spain and costs only Euro 10-12. About Cerveceria Catalana, it's so good and reasonable-4 of us had about 20 tapas (no alcohol) and the bill is about Euro 70-80 !"
3679,17-08-2014 ,4.0,"We arrived at about 8pm and queued to get our name put down for a table. The staff were really great and friendly for the most part (with one exception), but we were told we would have to wait for an hour and a half. We had heard it was worth it, so we decided to go off and do something else for that time and then come back. We eventually were seated and to be fair, the food was fantastic and the service very speedy. I'd recommend the escalivada! It apparently takes even longer to be seated outside, just a heads up."
3680,17-08-2014 ,4.0,"Excellent tapas but beware the crowds. Always a long line - though it's a big place with lots of tables. Fun atmosphere, see it as a way to spend your evening."
3681,17-08-2014 ,5.0,"The wait is long, but worth it. We truly enjoyed our food. Such a good vibe here and everyone is in a great mood. The service could be a bit friendlier and attentive, but is efficient. Fair pricing."
3682,17-08-2014 ,5.0,Very nice restaurant and good atmosphere. We waited for more then an hour but with a glass of cava it was worth the wait
3683,17-08-2014 ,4.0,"We had dinner at the Cerveceria Catalana. This is a very busy place and we had to wait more than one hour to get a table, but waiting was well worth it. We waited with a couple of glasses of white wine and sat outside.The food was very good. We ordered many different tapas and they all tasted very original: mushrooms, beef tenderloin, squid, octopus, peppers, cheese, mini hamburgers, salmon, anchovies, and so on. The service was very friendly. Prices were not expensive at all, especially the wines.Highly recommendable!"
3684,16-08-2014 ,5.0,"Great food, great drinks, fun and lively ambiance. Expect to wait for a table. Have some sangria at the bar while you wait."
3685,16-08-2014 ,5.0,We ate at this place twice all dishes are very well executed and I mean all of them ! The crab montado (montado means stuff on top of a piece of baguette bread) is good as are all the fish grill tapas. The only negative issue here for fast and furious traveler may be the queue to get a table or grab a seat at the bar: you can avoid this if you show up earlier than 1:20pm for lunch any other time you will fight crows specially if your party is more than 2. We were 3 and we managed but beware. You can have a beer while you wait if you need to wait . 
3686,16-08-2014 ,5.0,"What a fun place for tapas. Sure, most places serving tapas in Barcelona have them in display for the customer to make their selections, but few have the vibe of this place. It is almost completely outside of the tourist area so that might explain that most of those eating are locals. But, what really hit the spot was the paella...delicious! The beer is great as well...making the entire experience superb. So, have lunch here before visiting Caso Batllo and you will have an awesome day!"
3687,16-08-2014 ,2.0,"The first time we went there (21:30) it was a 2 hrs waiting list (they don´t take reservations), so we went back the evening after (18:00) and got a table within 20 mins. When we made our order from the limited menu, the waiter stopped us and said that we ordered to much food, and could not eat all this. - A nice gesture really. Only problem was that the amount of food we got was nothing to stop us for. Among other dishes, we ordered the ""assorted tapas""- stay away from that one! When we ate dessert, we ordered the hot chocolate cake, that also became a disappointment. Tasted pre-cooked, and on our way out we saw them throwing these mass-produced cakes into a microwave. Thats not what I expected of a restaurant as hyped as this, was extremely disappointed"
3688,15-08-2014 ,5.0,"The place is very busy both for lunch and dinner but the system is quite easy: you put your name down and they ask you to wait a certain amount of time (20 mins to 1 hour) so you can have a drink and come back when they call your name.Staff is very friendly, you can either wait for the table or seat at the tapas bar on a first come first served basis.Each of the tapas we tried were fresh, tasty and perfectly cooked. The tapas of the day change constantly to avoid repetition and they are all amazing ranging from paella to squid risotto etc.Sangria was the best we had in Barcelona and one liter is just 14 euros.The bill for a bunch of tapas and the sangria was about 15 euros per person and the overall experience was so nice that after trying a few other places we kept going back.It was definitely the best food we had in Barcelona!"
3689,15-08-2014 ,4.0,"Food was great in terms of choices and taste. But not a place for special requests since it is too busy (example if u request the meats to be well done). Quick and interesting service, a guy called Carlos gave us a table on arrival and very friendly and hyper active service. A place to try when u r in Barcelona"
3690,14-08-2014 ,5.0,"Warm noisy atmosphere, excellent food, decently sized tapas portions, inexpensive wines, helpful staff made me come back the next day. Off the beaten path, this place is certainly worth a visit. Although they accept walk-ins, it's better to book ahead as it gets crowded quickly. If lost for choice, go with a standard 5 tapas selection enough to feed two. "
3691,14-08-2014 ,3.0,I was so disappointed to eat here. We arrived around 7:30 om and waited in line for at least an hour. It was full of what seemed like tourists who had all been sent by their hotel concierge. The food looks nice but it lacks in taste. I read all the reviews and they seemed OK but it was one of my most disappointing meals in Barcelona. It did not live up to its hype and was not worth the wait.
3692,13-08-2014 ,5.0,"Went to Cerveceria Catalana based on a recommendation & my party & I (11 people total) loved it so much we went twice during our vacation! Everything we tried was delicious! The service wasn't amazing the first time, but the second time was much better. The waiter seemed to be in shock at the amount of food we were ordering (we're cubans, we like to eat a lot, give us a break). Anyway, overall excellent food & great prices! Must go!"
3693,12-08-2014 ,4.0,"A couple of friends recommended we try this place but told us we might have to wait. Once we got there, we stood and ordered a drink hoping for a couple of finish and open up a couple of stools at the bar, which is what happened exactly. It was great timing. The services from the bar-men were excellent. I personally enjoyed almost all of the items. Even the one's I didn't like were okay. The vibe was crowded and loud but I enjoy that. I would totally recommend it. I would've waited a full 30min. to find a table or seat but not more. It's not an amazing experience but a very nice one. Plus it was a 5min. walk from the H10 Art Gallery hotel where we were staying so it fit."
3694,12-08-2014 ,4.0,"Based on a recommendation, we went to Cerveceria Catalana when we were on the hop-on-hop-off tour, we got off at La Padera stop and walked to the restaurant. We were there for lunch and waited about 10-15 minute for a table on the patio (sidewalk).My wife and I each ordered a Flauta sandwich and spilt a side of potato Bravas. We each had a drink (beer / wine) and our total bill for lunch was $14 euros.The flautas were crispy, mini-baguettes with lots of toppings and cheese, I had a chorizio sausage flauta and my wife had one with eggplant and red peppers. Both were excellent.We recommended that place to others we met and would definitely return. Our server was quick, effecient and spoke english well."
3695,11-08-2014 ,3.0,"A lot of people waiting for this restaurant. We waited for 1 hour.... Thought this would be a really nice one but totally disappointed. Not thing special, food was okay but definitely can find somewhere better then here. Nice Atmosphere, won't recommend this one though."
3696,11-08-2014 ,5.0,"This restaurant, right off Rambla de Catalunya, has some of the best tapas in Barcelona. My wife and I have been here many times and it seems to always be better than before. The jabugo ham with the slender baguettes(flautas) was incredible, as was the sepia a la plancha, the variety of salads, and egg with bacon and potato straws (a must!). All accompanied by a very delightful sangria. We showed up for lunch at 1:30, put our name on the waiting list for the terrace, and had a perfect table in 15 minutes! Always worth the wait, even if it had been longer."
3697,9-08-2014 ,5.0,"Big tables for families in the back, (the back is really on the other side of the restaurant, giving way to another big window door) we were three and were assigned a table to share with another real nice family, which was to our surprise from the same country and they gave us a lot of tips! We had to wait for like 15 minutes but it was well worth it! I highly recommend the Arroz a la rogavente, Sardinas al escabeche, Pescado Frito, and Navajas a la Plancha. And don't forget the Crema Catalana. Simply delicious! Good service too, especially in such a busy day!"
3698,9-08-2014 ,5.0,"We were famished after a long city walking day and just wanted to eat good food. The salads and daily specials were delicious, hot, and FRESH. And served quickly! We got there around 5 PM (late, or early, depending on your perspective), and they seated us by the service station with other tourists so it was a bit noisy. I'd definitely go back for the food, but would choose a less hectic table location. "
3699,8-08-2014 ,5.0,"For one of the best tapas bar crawls, you must go to Cerveceria Catalana. And you must go early, find yourself a seat at the bar and order anything! The tapas are delicious, the drinks - from cervesa to sangria to cava - are good and the staff are efficient and friendly! The place has such a great vibe that we went there twice!"
3700,8-08-2014 ,3.0,"Was a very busy night. Staff wasn't paying much attention. Personally I'd prefer a more ""old""/classic style location for tapas instead of a fancy/new place (Gothic area?)."
3701,7-08-2014 ,5.0,"Delicious food and excellent service, if you arrive in the evening its recommended to book in advance or a wait will be very long. Fresh food and variety, take a few dishes and share."
3702,7-08-2014 ,5.0,"A must do tapas place! The wait is worth it. We ate at the bar and ordered everything that caught our eye's attention, and it was all so delicious, not to mention the 1/2 liter of Sangria. Service was also excellent! To avoid the line, pick a day and plan on going early! "
3703,6-08-2014 ,5.0,classic and innovative tapas like mini hamburgers and mini hotdogs. Everything we ate tasted good. Lacks however a large choice of salads but when you go there its for tapas aren't you ? To be tried ar least once during a trip to Barcelona. 
3704,5-08-2014 ,5.0,"We stayed three days in barcelona and ate twice here. The tapas are just divine. The Sangria with fresh fruit filled to the top is a joy. In short you just don't want to give up your hard won seat at the bar or one of the many tables ever! Filet mignon sliders and amazing shell fish and so much more. The choices seem infinite. The service is professional and smooth. Just make sure that you allow some time to wait for a table or seat. An absolute must when in Barcelona, maybe even worth flying over for this amazing eatry."
3705,5-08-2014 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant on the recommendation of a local, and we were not disappointed. We did have to wait for a while as they don't take reservations, but we knew that so it didn't really matter. The food was worth the wait though. Tapas can be brilliant or distinctly average, and these were definitely brilliant. Everything was cooked fresh and they had a great selection. I would definitely come here again next time we're in Barcelona!"
3706,5-08-2014 ,4.0,"Went there twice during my visit to Barcelona, first time was at 3pm and got a seat immediately. Food was great and served very promptly. Went a second time at 11pm and the crowd was spilling out onto the streets with a long waiting list, left then. Went back a third time at 8pm, waited almost an hour for a table inside(you can choose outdoors, which is a different waiting list). Ate in a rush, food was served abit late as we could see our food ready at the bar counter but the staff was too busy to serve them immediately. Had them slightly cold. The fried Camembert was good, and the cabreous egg(Swiss Rosti similar) was interesting. Great tapas bar, but plan to go during non peak hours if possible."
3707,4-08-2014 ,5.0,"Great atmosphere, great service and excellent food! Me and wife spent there lunch and enjoy every minute. The food is fresh, waiters are friendly and speak English."
3708,4-08-2014 ,5.0,"We had a very good meal at this restaurant. We didn't wait long. Really enjoyed the mini burgers. The best part was the craft beer that they have. It was by far the best beer we drank on our 16 day European trip. I don't remember the name, but I just had one glass and it was fantastic."
3709,4-08-2014 ,5.0,"So good, we went twice. Great vibe, kids welcome, fresh food and solid value. After around 7:30pm the queues get serious, so if you can, get there a little earlier. We never waited for a table and arrived around 7pm. The mixed salad plate, razor clams, prawn skewers and fried calamari were our favourites."
3710,3-08-2014 ,5.0,"I am crazy about this place.Food is fresh and DELICIOUS. Atmosphere is charged with positive energy. Staff friendly. IT is so much fun to sit at the bar and watch the place buzzing, food looking soooo good you would want to eat it all. Evenings are crazy busy but early lunch or early dinner is a more relaxed time. A pure pleasure to senses. Enjoy!!"
3711,3-08-2014 ,5.0,"Kudos to the Filipino crew who run this place like a well oiled machine. The front and back end didn't disappoint.The food is just wonderful. Thank you for the recommendations because we just had one of our best meals in Barce. The baby squid was the highlight of the night, it was cooked just right, not rubbery at all.Always a line so prepare to wait."
3712,2-08-2014 ,3.0,"The calamary taste was very good, with a beautiful presentation. The bread with tomatoes jam on top was also very tasty and matched the food served. However, the price was a bit more expensive compared to the other restaurants with the same style. I found the servant was very nice but so intrusive to some extent. Just because I have an asian face considered ressembles to those Filipinos workers in that restaurant, does not mean that the servant can ask or say anything to me. It was quite surprising that one of the servant talked to me in Tagalog (I suppose) and then changed into english after I expressed my ""no comperhension"" face. Then she said ""oo I saw you in metro two days ago in line 2, that I looked like a Filipino etc etc etc etc"". Then I explained her that I was not Filipino, I was on holiday in Barcelona and had nothing to do with what she had just told me. I felt that the servant was nice but somehow it went beyond what she had to do in serving client. My suggestion: First, welcome the clients in the official language (spanish or english), no matter how the clients apparence look like. Second, be nice but do not overwhelm beyond the job desk to serve the client."
3713,2-08-2014 ,5.0,"I do not go to empty restaurants. Then when we seen people queuing to get in, we stopped and decided to see what is this about. It was about 20:00 and I was dying to try to find nice tapas place. And I have to say I founded! Prices good. Food excellentService - superbfinal bill - not upsetting! I will highly recommend this place. We waited around 30-40 minutes to get table. It was worth it every minute. Restaurant is full of life, where we were watching chefs cooking tapas by fast tables. Great experience!:-)happy customer!"
3714,1-08-2014 ,4.0,"Went here with a friend in from Florida, she had someone recommend we go. I tried calling for a reservation but was told to just get there early. We arrived at 7:30 and were told we had a 45/50 minute wait. After 25 minutes we had a table. We ordered baby squids, a steak pinxo, bravas, a veggie plate and wine. Every thing was delicious and the service was very quick. The restaurant was super packed but that's definitely part of the atmosphere. Will definitely go back!"
3715,31-07-2014 ,3.0,"Place was packed and there was an hour wait on the list. We figured this would be a good sign but were deceived by the choices of tapas and the price we paid for. Wine was good and fresh. Waiters put us in the ""english"" section with the other tourists and I felt rushed to eat. Good food, but I guess you can find better for what you pay. "
3716,30-07-2014 ,3.0,"We went to tis place after reading many positive reviews in Tripadvisor. We expected to have exceptional spanish food but we didn't get it at all. Draft beer was quite ok, as well as meat. But the seafood tapas were stinky and didn't even look good. The service was quick enough, but the waiter didn't even offer us any wipes or lemon water with the shrimps so we had to ask for it explaining what we need and why. And on top of everything, he price was not reasonable from our point of view. To sum up the experience I would say that this restaurant is not good enough to include it in your must-visit list. This is the kind of restaurants that you can find around the corner."
3717,30-07-2014 ,4.0,"We went there after getting recommendations.You need to sign up and wait for an hour before being seated. Meanwhile you can order some drinks (that's what I did).The service is very good, and the food is also yummy.Two things that bothered me - prices were a bit high for a tapas restaurant, and not enough dishes without any fish or seafood.All in all it's a great restaurant that's worth the wait. I really recommend to order the fries with spicy ketchup and an egg. It's absolutely great."
3718,29-07-2014 ,5.0,We ate here why visiting Barcelona before our cruise in June. A friend recommend that we try this restaurant and very good choice! It's about 10-15 minute walk from Placaa de Catalunya.We got the restaurant around 6:30pm and place was packed! We luck out with open table for 7 people. Recommend reservation ahead time!!! Very good selections of tapas and presentation of the plate was very good. Very good service. Price was reasonable! Must try their seafood specials!!!Worth the walk from Las Ramblas.
3719,29-07-2014 ,5.0,"We were advised to go here by a local. He told us to get there by 8 but we didn't heed the warning. On arriving, the crowd was swollen as far as the street. You need to fight your way in and put your name down with the hostess. We were told our wait would be 1 hour and 15mins. We stood at the bar and drank some beer and ate some delicious pinxos. After a while a slot freed up at the bar and we slipped in (this might be a better way to get ahead of waiting for your table). The menu at the bar is the same as the restaurant. We had 4 pinxos, patatas bravas, a prawn skewer, a cod omelette, beef tenderloin skewer, a pepper stuffed with mozzarella, 3 beers, 1 glass of wine, 2 fantas for €50.The food quality is excellent but the wait is madness and made me wonder was the restaurant a bit of a tourist trap! Based on the price and quality, I think not but be prepared to wait, listen hard for your name or fight for a place at the bar."
3720,29-07-2014 ,5.0,"So worth the long wait! Fun-noisy, good vibe...at 3:30 PM on a Sunday, so things were hoppin'.Get the tiny octopus, about six to a plate. And the fried calamari as well. Nice selection of international beers. Solid service. Note: the ""crema catalunya"" dessert is essentially a creme brulee, although the menu description does not hint at that."
3721,28-07-2014 ,5.0,"Before starting our feast we had to wait for half an hour. This was despite the rain, OK. The food (mostly seafood) was quick to arrive and tasted of heaven with a slice of catalonia. The Ambiance was inviting, the waiters friendly and the beer tasty. I recommend this restaurant for the food, price and location. Hugs and kisses. "
3722,28-07-2014 ,4.0,High quality tapas. Widely appreciated - hence often long waits. Forget it on Friday and Saturday at peak times. We had a 30 minute wait at 7pm on a Sunday. But good food. Average service - very crowded so great atmosphere. 
3723,27-07-2014 ,5.0,"By far our favorite tapas restaurant in Barcelona! Or anywhere else, for that matter. We've been coming here for years and the quality and diversity is as great as ever. It's good for breakfast, with lovely little sandwiches made on thin, crispy baguettes and fantastic coffee. At around noon, the extensive tapas dishes are brought out and there are always daily specials, usually including a paella or risotto dish served as tapas. Amazing shellfish and salads. The beer and house wines are good and it's excellent value all around. Try to score a seat at the tapas bar so you can get a close look at the tapas and immediate service. Failing that, ask for a table in the lovely back room; very ornate and a great atmosphere. Would try to avoid the upstairs area; not nearly as nice."
3724,27-07-2014 ,5.0,"We really loved this place. Amazing food. A few dishes we wouldn't normally order/eat came with a tapas assortment platter. My wife loved the fish (she dislikes most fish, and sardines are certainly off her normal list) and I was dubious of the crab salad at first only to find it was amazing. The fried camembert exceeded cheese plates we had in Paris. The Prawns, Patatas Bravas(lovely sauce), peppers, and the steak tapas which caused me to moan out loud made the waiter and the old spanish lady sitting next to us (who was smoking a cigar while eating ice-cream and drinking champagne) laugh. All in all, great service, great food, and off the tourist path, this is is a place I will eat at every time I go to Barcelona!"
3725,27-07-2014 ,5.0,"Yes it is crowded and full of tourists since it is on every guide.Anywayve to wait sometimes few hours but it is still great.The huevos cabreados are a must try ! If you do not want to wait too much (they do not take bookings), do not go at the Spanish dinner time but try the English dinner time ;-), it is much less crowded early evening..."
3726,26-07-2014 ,4.0,"Great food, especially the fillet of beef dish, quick service! However head down early, went down for dinner one evening and the wait for a table was 90 minutes! So we decided to go for lunch the next day and got seated straight away!"
3727,26-07-2014 ,5.0,"Truly awesome restaurant. Excellent tapas, well prepared from fresh ingredients. Crowded, but that is inevitable with such a good price per quality ratio! "
3728,26-07-2014 ,5.0,We stopped for lunch. The house red wine is excellent. The service was exceptional. Food was fast and fresh. We had a party of 10 including 4 kids. Bill with two bottles of wine was 100€
3729,25-07-2014 ,5.0,"We were sent here by my mother. It is a lovely part of Barcelona with tree lined avenues. Similar to Paris. The first night we went we had no wait and arrived at 7.30pm. The table was near the entrance and the air conditioning was very high. The food is tapas and went down well with everyone. They do mini hotdogs the size of your finger, mini hamburgers,peppers de padron, wonderful mushrooms with asparagus.We also all had the dessert. The kids ate chocolate pudding. I had Creme Catalana (creme brullee).It was so good that we went another night. we sat around the corner it was not freezing but had a great meal on our last night in BARCELONA!"
3730,24-07-2014 ,5.0,Even in the middle of the week in February the place was crowdy. Better to come early. However tapas are simply fantastic! We did not tested the wine but simple beer. Great place !
3731,22-07-2014 ,5.0,"Returned 3 times to Catalana in 6 days. Need I say more? It is well priced and has seriously AMAZING tapas. Loved all of the dishes we had and enjoyed the buzz of the cafe. Do sit at the tapas bar, pick your dishes...and sip sangria. "
3732,22-07-2014 ,3.0,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated outside. The waiter was very helpful. My husband wanted to try some traditional tapas and we asked for a selection as a starter. Big mistake. We had several plates of ham, cheese and tomato bread plus some garlic mushrooms. It was nice but there was too much as by now the waiter had been back to help us choose our mains, he directed us to the most expensive dishes on the menu. I ordered lamb Catalonian style and my husband ordered fish. The fish was tasty but was basically a flat fish. It came with one potato and some peppers. My lamb was a lamb shank which was vastly overcooked and dry. It was served with chips. The waiter then recommended a dessert and we said no initially as we were full, we did eventually opt for a dessert to share which was a dry almond cake. It was average. We also had a bottle of wine which was nice. The bill was €95 which I think was excessive. Nice location, lovely waiter but I think the tapas was enough as a main and as we were then encouraged to buy the most expensive main as well, I felt slightly ripped off :("
3733,21-07-2014 ,5.0,"This was recommended to us on our first day in Barcelona and if we eat like this every day I will be a very happy bunny indeed! Don't expect to walk in and get a seat, we arrived to be told it would be about an hour but there is an alternative. Hover behind people at the counter and when they get up you just sit down quickly and order to your heart's content. When we were leaving I asked the girl organising the tables where we were on the list and was told it shouldn't be more than another 15 mins! It's more fun at the counter anyway Ithink. The food here is great, the staff are under serious pressure but still relatively calm (much more so than I would be under the circumstances) and will take time to try to explain what a dish is if you don't know. It's amazing value for money and if you leave hungry then you have hollow legs! Yes the wait time is long, yes it all seems very chaotic but when a place like this is full of locals in a tourist area.....well that speaks for itself really in my book. Oh and it is definitely worth waiting for!!"
3734,21-07-2014 ,5.0,"Absolutely delicious tapas and Spanish Chardonnay. Prices not exorbitant and very friendly service. Fairly long waits, but worth it; you can generally find a seat at the bar while you wait. This spot was recommended by a tour guide and the recommendation was spot on."
3735,21-07-2014 ,4.0,"Barcelona travellers.. You should definitely goes to this place.. They serve Tapas here. So if you're traveling to Barcelona or perhaps live in Barcelona, you really have to visit this place.The place is quite hip and trendy with friendly service. Since this place is hip and trendy you have to wait for a while to be seated. Perhaps reservation would a better option. But definitely you should try this place."
3736,20-07-2014 ,5.0,"This restaurant is open 0900 to 0200 everyday. I went on a Sunday evening at 7pm. We were told there was a 20 minute wait for a table for 2, but we only ended up waiting 10 minutes. The food was delicious and had many Catalonian specialities on the menu. I would recommend the crunchy Camembert and mini hotdogs. Also if your timing is right and you find seats at the bar, you don't need to wait for a table and you can still enjoy the full tapas menu."
3737,20-07-2014 ,4.0,It was a battle of wills but we won!! We waited an hour and five minutes to get a table for 2. We were told we'd have to wait 20 mins so relaxed with a drink. An hour later we were getting frustrated as it seemed the queuing system was a bit chaotic. Food was delicious but they really tried to rush us out the door. Kept offering us desert. We stood our ground though and eventually they left us alone. Have the mini burgers and the prawns on a skewer. 
3738,20-07-2014 ,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went based on a recommendation. It's a nice spot with cool decor, tasty food and lots of selection. Only complaint was that the service was mediocre - waiter did not seem interested in being there in the slightest, we ordered dishes that never showed up (though they weren't on the bill either). Go for the food not the service. "
3739,20-07-2014 ,5.0,"We were recommended the place by our hotel concierge and decided to try it after some shopping on passeige de gracias.We arrived there at 6.30 pm and luckily had to wait only to 10 mts before getting the coveted table outside(they don't take reservations).because 7.00pm onwards the place was super crowded,frequented by locals and tourists alike.and I can see why.It probably had one the best tapas in barcelona.the seafood tapas are to die for.we tried the squid and cuttlefish.yum!interesting grilled pepito peppers-not hot but flavorful and ofcourse the patatas brava.we were seated on stable next to a sweet,old couple ,who made us try their plate of local dish of small dried fish that was served fried.delish.would have never ordered it ,just by reading the menu.The place is very popular and sometimes the service can be a bit slow..we didn't mind it.we were happy lapping up the good food,friendly atmosphere over our pitcher of sangria.Highly recommend it!"
3740,20-07-2014 ,4.0,"They have great ""tapas"". If you go with a group, like I did, you can pick different type of dishes/tapas and share. It is pretty good. You should also be there VERY soon.. otherwise you must wait on a line outside because it gets too crowded. Attention is nothing exceptional but the food was good, so I did survive. "
3741,20-07-2014 ,5.0,We went to Barcelona for 3 nights and we loved it here so much we ate here on 2 nights and 1 lunchtime. It gets very very busy so expect to wait for a table but it is well worth it.
3742,19-07-2014 ,5.0,Fancy sister of Ciudad Condal and the food is similar just trendier. You cannot book a table and we waited over 30 minutes for a table but we enjoyed a jug of sangria while we were waiting and there was a really nice crowd hanging around the bar and waiting to sit.We were lucky to get a table outside which made it even better. Food and service was excellent.
3743,19-07-2014 ,5.0,We have eaten here 3 times & feel like regulars. We came the first day we arrived in Barcelona thanks to TA:). We learned the drill after a really nice guy offered us his bar stools & advised us to be noticed if we wanted food while sitting at the bar. Decide what you want & then make sure the bar tender knows you are ready to eat! The hamburger (slider) & Solo Mia are both delicious meat options. The Catalan version of paella (fideua) is another fab dish. Polpito is also great if you like tiny octopus. If you want a table then come at a slightly off eating time and be prepared to wait in line to put your name on the list. This place must be recommended in the guide books of many other countries:)
3744,19-07-2014 ,5.0,"We came here early, around 7 pm and the place was already very busy. We waited for a table for about 45 minutes, sat and had a beer, but it was definitely worth it. The beef tenderloin was one of the best things we ate while in Spain. The cuttlefish was delicious and the potatoes with egg (I can't remember the name) were wonderful. Order the sangria. The service isn't great, but the place is packed so just flag down a server. Definitely recommended!"
3745,18-07-2014 ,4.0,"Well, after passing by many times and seeind big crowds gathering every night, I figure it must be more than good. Having so many options in Barcelona makes it very difficult to choose the right one. Cerveceria Catalana was also recommended by the hotel clerk, so we gave it a try. We arrived at 10.30 and were told it would be 30 minutes for our table. Of course you can go and sit at the bar if you want. We decided to wait and after 15 minutes we had a lovely table. The place was full of a mix of tourists and locals, you could hear every language! Service was great, food amazing, and prices just on the expensive side. Will definitely go back"
3746,18-07-2014 ,4.0,"If you are looking for very nicely presented tapas of all types, this is the place. When the weather is fine, you can also sit outdoors (if there is enough space, expect a waiting line). The food is really good, the service is friendly and fast (even though the restaurant was full). For Barcelona the prices are however rather upper limit (for what you get)."
3747,18-07-2014 ,5.0,"Outstanding!! If you love Spanish food this is the place!! Everything is delicious, from the solomillo flauta to the camambert crujiente, one of my favorite places to eat in the world. It gets very busy, to avoid crowds, go late afternoon or sit at the bar while you are given a table. Either way, do not miss it!!"
3748,17-07-2014 ,4.0,"We had lunch and was ver good! Price ok we had different dishes ""TAPAS"" and enjoyed them all. Patatas bravas, anchoas, jamon de jabugo, etc...todo delicioso!!!!!"
3749,17-07-2014 ,5.0,"I don't often post reviews on trip advisor - i think this is my third every - but I had to make an exception for this restaurant. This was not only the best meal of my 3 month trip through Israel and Europe, but one of the best meals I've ever had. There are many good restaurants in Barcelona but this one is a MUST. My favourite tapas were the cheeseburger slider with caramelized onion, the beef tenderloin slider and the ""cabraeros,"" which are very skinny fries (frites) mixed with hot sauce and egg.Note that the beef is cooked medium rare unless you tell the waiter otherwise.We waited for an hour but it was definitely worth it. We just walked to McDonald's down the street to sit on the internet for a bit while we waited."
3750,16-07-2014 ,5.0,We visited this restaurant twice during our Barcelona city trip. The place is very busy. Sometimes you have to queue to get in. first First time we got a table inside to have lunch. The menu was extensive. we had chosen different cold sandwiches. they were delicious. we also had some very nice fresh tapas. Second time we only had fish tapas (also very fresh and excellent) at the counter. The service at the counter or at the bar was even friendlier and better compared with the first time.Recommended all the way 
3751,16-07-2014 ,5.0,Our hotel suggested we should eat here. Such an amazing atmosphere and the food was delicious. We did have a little bit of a wait but it was definitely worth it. 
3752,15-07-2014 ,5.0,"The tapas here are fresh and delicious. Try all the unique seafood choices, patatas bravas, ham, pepito peppers, and even the mini burger & hotdogs for the kids! Sit at the bar to see the full array. And get there by 7:30 to get a seat!"
3753,15-07-2014 ,5.0,"This place is so full of people, they sure don't need my recommendation to fill the joint, but i want others to know that they really do live up to their reputation as one of the best in Barcelona"
3754,15-07-2014 ,5.0,"Delicious food, really busy place, but if you can find a table outside you will be fine. Sangria was average but all the rest was amazing. Will come back!"
3755,13-07-2014 ,5.0,"The place is very good. Tip: choose the balcony seats.Be prepared to wait if you want the balcony, the place is crowded. "
3756,12-07-2014 ,5.0,"We went forca dinner in this tapas bar, it was crouded but worted:)waiters were nice and of course tapas were amazing.Price ok, I recomanded"
3757,11-07-2014 ,5.0,"We decided to visit this restaurant as we were in the area nearby. The place does not take any reservations beforehand so we had to queue for about 15 mins. The place was heaving with both locals and tourists. We finally got a table inside and were given the menus. The food list was extensive and quite veggie friendly. The tapas was simply amazing! The patata bravas was to die for and so were the hot chilli peppers (they were flavoursome but not spicy). All in all we were happy we came to eat here, it was a great experience. The waiters were friendly and explained the menu in english so don't be afraid to ask. Service was good too! Although this place is packed with mainly tourists (90%), don't hesitate to eat here, as the food is really amazing."
3758,11-07-2014 ,5.0,Super chic place where you wait a while for seating with a glass of wine in you hand. Amazing tapas. Open space. Good and cheap Cava. Not good sangria though!
3759,11-07-2014 ,5.0,Our favorite tapas place in Spain. It get quite crowded so expect a wait. Order some wine and hang with all the other happy folks waiting. It's a shorter wait if you sit at the bar -- an excellent and fun alternative for a twosome. The restaurant is in a great neighborhood you will enjoy it!
3760,10-07-2014 ,4.0,"Cerveseria Catalana is a very busy tapas bar, and you may have to wait some time, but as soon as you're lucky to get a table or preferably a seat around the bar, all the waiting time is forgotten. The quality of the tapas are generally very high, but the most memorable items this night were - the mini hamburgers with beef, soft onions and cheese, - the navajas, - the mar y montana skerwers, and- the escalivadas with goat cheese.Finally, we tasted the their lemon cheese cake and the hot chokolate cake (a coulant chocolate), and both were truly mouthwatering.Highly recommended - in particular if you can get a seat around one of the the bars."
3761,10-07-2014 ,4.0,"Had a wonderful experience in this Tapas restaurant. The waiting time was to be an hour and fifteen minutes, but we sat at the counter and had excellent service there, so did not need a table. The waiter working behind the counter was pleasant and very amiable. Needless to say, the tapas were delicious. To be recommended!"
3762,9-07-2014 ,5.0,Best tapas we had during our trip to Barcelona. The restaurant is always crowded so plan to go early if you don't want to wait. Tables are small and very close together. Service was fast but waitstaff was not as fluent in English as servers in other restaurants. The menu is extensive and the food was very fresh.
3763,9-07-2014 ,5.0,"It would be an understatement to say this place is great. I spent three weeks in Barcelona last winter and it's the only place I went to three times during my stay. In fact, usually when I was trying other restaurants in that city, I would wish I was back in Cerveceria Catalana instead. I recommend you try everything they make. Wash it all down with a bottle of cava. The place is hopping with energy. The food is authentic and absolutely superb."
3764,9-07-2014 ,4.0,"was our preferred place to eat. great atmosphere, good food. reasonable pricesWe ate there three ties and will probably com again when we visit Barcelona again"
3765,9-07-2014 ,5.0,"Went Cervecería Catalana after a recommendation from a local coffee shop and we were not disappointed. On arriving it was very busy with local people having lunch, we had que for about 10 mins but well worth the wait. The tapas were a lot bigger than expected and of very good quality, surprised how cheap the food was for this quality of food. Highly recommended and dont let the crowds put you off."
3766,6-07-2014 ,5.0,"Absolutely love this place. We went twice during our three night stay but if we had gone on our first night too I am sure we would have gone for all three!We turned up at 10.30pm on the first visit and waited an hour and 15 minutes for a table. We were told it would be this long and had no issue. We got a bottle of the house wine (delicious and cheap) and soaked up the atmosphere. I didn't hear or see any British or Americans whilst we were there and it was great to be in amongst the locals! Once we were showed to our table we ordered everything we fancied and it was ALL delicious! On the second night we turned up at 6.30pm and walked straight in and got a table immediately with no wait - so that is definitely the way to do it you don't want to wait! Again the food and wine did not let us down!We were pleasantly surprised how cheap it was both nights and would highly recommended this restaurant. Don't let the crowds put you off when you turn up - just go, wait and enjoy the atmosphere and food!"
3767,6-07-2014 ,1.0,"Cons: The only positive thing is that the restaurant is open till 1:30 a.m and the staff are somewhat friendly.The food is not great at all. we tried a variety of tapas. the food sat on my stomach all night and I hated it. The bread was hard, nothing was remotely good. I have no idea how this restaurant got so many good reviews, there is a long line up during the day and you imagine the food must be amazing.gross part: we were sitting close to the washroom entrance and I saw kitchen staff going to washroom with their kitchen gloves on and coming out of the washroom with the same gloves still on!!!! "
3768,6-07-2014 ,5.0,"Casual atmosphere and reasonably priced tapas. Great taste of Barcelona, and would definitely go back again!"
3769,5-07-2014 ,2.0,"Imagine you are in a themed restaurant on a cruise and you will understand what Cerveceria Catalana is like. Everyone there was an American tourist. While some guests may have dressed for dinner, the majority were still in their gym shoes, Nike elite shorts and tank tops. The food was mediocre at best. Though the dishes generally seemed to be authentic, execution was poor. We had better food off La Rambla. "
3770,5-07-2014 ,5.0,"Discovered it through recommendations on Foursquare, was very happy with the visit. Sat by the bar, and tasted 5-6 different dishes. All very good. A lot of people, both lical and tourist. A friend of mine says this is his favorite tapas restaurant and I understand why.Highly recommended. "
3771,1-07-2014 ,4.0,"Very good food small dishes, ""Tapas"" cooked in the moment any Microwave.Excelent quality Price, perfect location."
3772,1-07-2014 ,5.0,This was my third visit to Cerveceria Catalana. Most fun to sit at bar and just pick the tapas that look the best. Also ask for recommendations. One of the best in Barcelona!
3773,1-07-2014 ,3.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a good place with good food. But, a bit over rated though.There are quite some very good alternatives and easier to get a table.Try La Bodegueta on Rambla Catalunya or (their bigger version) on Calle Provença (just off Rambla Catalunya)."
3774,1-07-2014 ,5.0,"Perfect central location, huge food choice and not expensive. This restaurant has it all but you need to book because it is so popular."
3775,30-06-2014 ,4.0,"The atmosphere and restaurant itself was great, with a real buzz and very full. The staff were helpful and spoke good English, explaining all dishes well. The food was tasty and there was excellent choice and it was not too expensive either. A good bet for a dinner in Barcelona, but I would not say I was blown away or wowed... I have had better versions of some of the dishes elsewhere (including in London!) but overall I should imagine it will not disappoint."
3776,29-06-2014 ,5.0,"If you want real tapas with an authentic Spanish atmosphere then here is the place to come!Great value, great service and incredible food, you don't even mind having to queue 30mins due to the popularity, just have a 2.50euro wine to pass the time!"
3777,29-06-2014 ,4.0,"A nice variety of fantastic tapas, expertly prepared, reasonably priced, and served quickly. We sampled a diverse selection, and each dish was delicious and satisfying. The restaurant is located in a pleasant neighborhood, and the interior space is modern, clean, and attractive. This place is very popular and lines are not uncommon, but service is efficient so tables turn over quickly and the food is worth the wait. This is a restaurant whose favorable reputation and strong following, among locals and tourists alike, are well deserved."
3778,28-06-2014 ,5.0,"The tapas ans Sangria were amazing. Patatas Bravas, fried peppers the usuals. Not to miss the catalan creme and the home made cake! "
3779,27-06-2014 ,5.0,"We went twice during our stay in Barcelona. The wait for a table was definitely worth it. My husband was able to get me a glass of wine, so then we people watched! It is a lively place. My favorite dish (we sampled many things), was a fried potato dish (the potatoes were cut and looked like fettuccini). It was served with a tomato garlic aioli and two sunny side up fried eggs. The server tosses it table side. OMG. it was yummy!!! I ordered the house wine by the glass, which was an excellent value for 2 euros."
3780,26-06-2014 ,5.0,"This is a great tapas restaurant. We ate here our first night in BCN, and returned a few days later for another great meal. Comfortable seating, decent prices, wide selection and a very helpful staff, most of whom had better English than I had Spanish."
3781,26-06-2014 ,4.0,"Located on one of my favorite streets. A mouthwatering selection of Flautas( sandwiches) great coffee and sweets and excellent Iberico Jamon . A very popular place for locals, so arrive early-ish."
3782,25-06-2014 ,4.0,"Our hotel was one block up the street and the staff highlighted this as the best tapas in Barcelona. We tried to go several times and there was a long wait so we finally decided to go at 5 PM and were seated immediately. The food was very good, but not sure it would rank at the best tapas we had on our trip. The beef is amazing though and everything else we ordered was also very good, just not sure it was the best we have ever had."
3783,25-06-2014 ,4.0,"It was really busy when we arrived there and we had to wait for an hour, but it was definitely worth it! The best tapas I've ever had and the interior is also nice. And the prices are also very reasonable. A recommendation! visited in july 2012"
3784,25-06-2014 ,4.0,"We decided to take a risk and go without reservations! The wait was actually shorter than expected, and the food was well worth the wait. Extended menu with terrific selection. Only complaint was that the Kitchen seemed to be very slow getting out the tapas. We were afraid they forgot a couple of our selections! Not our cheapest or best venture, but a very solid selection. For those claiming discrimination, at least attempting to speak in Spanish went a long way throughout Spain. Give it a shot, and your experience will not only be better, but more authentic!"
3785,24-06-2014 ,4.0,"We went there around 12pm, skipped the usual lunch hour but waited for 10 mins or so. (After 1:30pm, there were more than 15 people waiting I guess). The best tapas was the pawns and the desserts were not bad. Maybe we sat outside by the road so it wasn't particularly noisy and quite comfy. Reasonably priced. It wasn't a big surprise though on food quality but overall it deserves a try."
3786,24-06-2014 ,4.0,"Place is always crowded and very busy. Staff aren't the most friendliest and always seem very hassled. But the restaurant whips up excellent tapas. We had the Beed Tenderlion, Spanish Omelette and the Prawn Salad which were excellent, in our opinion. It was our first meal in Barcelona and would recommend this place to anyone who visits Barcelona. And also be sure to have Sangria when you're there too."
3787,24-06-2014 ,3.0,"After reading the other reviews, I was expecting good food at a reasonable price. I was a bit disappointed. The food definitely wasn't great. I tell this because, I seriously cannot remember tasting anything and going ""wow!"". We had to wait for close to an hour for our table and I wasn't impressed with the service. The waiter who attended us was not friendly and it felt like he just wanted us to order our food, eat and leave. He seemed disinterested. When we asked what he would recommend us to try, he replied that everything is good and try whatever. Don't mistake me, the food is good. I enjoyed the mini burgers. I do not feel like recommending anything else that I tasted."
3788,24-06-2014 ,5.0,"It is very busy whenever you go, the head waitress takes your name and you just have to wait till a table becomes available. Its well worth wait , everything we ate was wonderful,good service too.Not touristy at all, just smart tapas bar used by locals. We ate lobster ,fried baby squid , delicios salads, hams, paella , etc .dessert crema catalana also yummy. You must go here when in Barcelona, we were just there for long weekend and ate there twice."
3789,22-06-2014 ,3.0,"You can't book here, so eat at English meal times to ensure a table within the next 30 minutes or so. But you can have a drink while you wait. The tapas tasted fresh and was no doubt tasty. This place was so hyped up to me that I expected amazing things, and I came away a little confused as to why everyone loves it so much. Having lived in Barcelona for a year now I can say I've eaten better tapas. Although, the Bravas here were one of the best I've tasted. It is, however, amazing value for money. I couldn't believe how reasonably priced it was. And tourists and locals alike love this place so I recommend you try it."
3790,22-06-2014 ,2.0,"We went for lunch, and the place was very busy, but we got a table after a 5 minute wait. Not too bad. The place felt like a restaurant machine, with no identity or personal charm. The waiter were bossing other servers around while taking our order and were not particularly friendly. The food was decent, some very good dishes, some not so good. Pig fois gras.... are you kidding me?!After a while we just had to get out of the place, as the noise level was horrible.. getting out into the streets felt much calmer.There are so many nice, charming and friendly tapas restaurants in Barcelona, so there are no reason to go the extra mile to get to this restaurant. It sure feels like a tourist trap and I do not think the Tripadvisor rank is justified, we were unfortunately very dissapointed."
3791,22-06-2014 ,4.0,Well worth a visit. The Atmosphere is excellent here. This was our first meal in Barcelona and would recommend it to everyone!
3792,22-06-2014 ,4.0,"We dined here twice, once for lunch, once for dinner. The food was fantastic both times, the service a little sporadic the first time, however the service was superb the second time. Comfortable seats, clean bathrooms. Has to be high on your list."
3793,22-06-2014 ,4.0,Great tapas and good wine by the glass a nice small fideua and all tapas are good long wait for a table
3794,21-06-2014 ,1.0,We went on a busy Saturday night. We joined the queue outside which turned out to not be a queue and just people waiting to be seated that had already put there names down.There was no one to reserve a table with and the place looked liked absolute chaos. We went elsewhere and had a great meal.
3795,20-06-2014 ,5.0,"Not the cheapest and quite busy, but outstanding! All was delicious, from first to last: fish was great, sangria yummi, service efficient and huge choice! Just try it! Well worth the money!"
3796,19-06-2014 ,5.0,"First meal in Barcelona, could not have picked a better place than this. Tapas was awesome! Service is fast and good."
3797,19-06-2014 ,5.0,"It's a blessing & a curse! It's always a downer to see such a crowded cafe, but you know there must be a good reason...in this case deliciously prepared small portions of various Spanish foods to try & also inexpensive! While waiting in line our first night, I managed to see what others had chosen & then asked the servers the names of the foods...helps so much if you don't know what the heck the various food items are on the menu. Best use of time while waiting so you don't get a surprise on your table. Best tip I can give to avoid lines is to go early if you can & then just enjoy as long as you like! I found if you are genuinely friendly to the help, you get back great, friendly service. Kathy BNC, USA"
3798,19-06-2014 ,5.0,"Our favorite tapas bar in Barcelona! Be sure to get there early or you'll be standing in line for quite awhile. I would recommend sitting at the counter for the full experience and for easier ordering. Stick to the menu is nice BUT viewing all the many different tapas that are constantly being displayed on the counter make it a ""must do"" for trying foods you would otherwise miss on the menu. Beer and wine selection is good as well. Be sure to try the Galician style octopus!"
3799,18-06-2014 ,3.0,"This place has pretty good tapas - very good for Barcelona. We arrived on a Tuesday around 6pm. There were no lineups and we decided to grab a spot at the bar. The bartenders (who also served tapas) were informative. They told us about the different tapas options and explained the tapas behind the bar, when we asked. The prices were compatible to other tapas places, but the tapas themselves were higher quality.If you're looking for a good tapas place in Barcelona, this is it.I'm giving it 3 stars because I think the food is only average if you compare it to places outside Barcelona."
3800,17-06-2014 ,5.0,"Fresh, modern, relaxed and delicious! Order small bites of everything that looks appealing (with a glass of wine or beer), even if you don't know what you're eating! "
3801,17-06-2014 ,5.0,The best place we had dinner on our honeymoon. It was my second visit to Barcelona and this resturant either. It will be the third if I come to Barcelona again :)
3802,16-06-2014 ,5.0,"This hotel was recommended by Trip Advisor and was near my hotel. Generally I do not go to the same restaurant more than once when I am traveling as I like to try as many as possible. This place was so good and so reasonably priced that I went back every night. They have a fabulous and extensive selection of tapas. All ingredients are fresh and portions are large. A glass of a good chardonnay cost under $3! The atmosphere is hopping. Go early as they do not take reservations, and the line starts forming out the door by 7 PM. I usually ate at the tapas bar, but if you want to wait for a table and a elegant, quieter setting, they have that too."
3803,16-06-2014 ,5.0,"This place can not be faulted at all. Probably the best tapas I have ever eaten and so reasonably priced. It's very popular so there is generally a wait for table but all I say is, go go go!"
3804,16-06-2014 ,5.0,The location is quite central and the place is just quite engaging when you come across it. It makes you want to eat there even if you have to wait thirty mins for a table or stand and queue to eat at the bar in the front of the restaurant. The service is brusque but with great displays and amazing tasting food. The whole prawn were just phenomenal along with many other amazing offerings from the display at the bar. The place is nice addictive and the queue always reassures you that this place is a gem. 
3805,16-06-2014 ,5.0,"We stopped by Catalana on a Friday night about 20:00 after a day of power sightseeing of the Familia Sagrada and Parc Guell etc. the place was hopping but from the look of the tapas at the bar we decided to wait the 30 minutes for a table. We were glad we did.Just getting to the lady taking names for tables inside is a bit of gauntlet run. There was a separate list for dining on the sidewalk which would be nice except for all the bar traffic smoking next to your food. Time passed pretty quickly and the place is bigger than you would expect standing outside. When we were seated comes my only complaint. The waiter talked me out of getting a liter of Sangria, but the half liter went too quickly so we needed another. We ordered about 10 dishes for 2 adults and our tween and all were very good. The fried white anchovies and the garlic prawns were very tasty. They had mini burgers which my wife and daughter had to try and they were terrific bites of crusted beef patties, juicy in the middle with carmelized onions. The potatas bravas were a little different not soaked in sauce but instead lightly fried bites served with garlic mayonnaise and the more traditional spicy red sauce on the side. It worked.Another fun thing about this place is we were close to our neighboring table and began to share tapas between us so we all could get more tastes of the extensive menu. In our 12 days in Europe this meal is the standout for a fun and delicious meal. My daughter who is pretty picky has not stopped talking about the experience. This will be a place we come back to when we return to Barca."
3806,15-06-2014 ,4.0,"You must give your name at the desk if you want a table, then you will be called when one is available. Listen well for your call, we missed ours and waited for ages. Food was great, service very slick and cost reasonable."
3807,14-06-2014 ,4.0,"It's worth waiting your turn in this cerveseria, and try the countre rather than the room it's even better. Greta choice and very good Tapas. Good service too and with the smile !"
3808,14-06-2014 ,4.0,"We could tell that it was a good restaurant from the place being packed - with locals and tourists. And it was a recommendation from a local.This place did not disappoint. Doesn't try to be anything fancy but just a good quick turnaround tapas restaurant.We had 4 tapas (seafood, meat, vegetarian) and some Torres wine. SO cheap! For the 2 of us it was around 25 euros. And we were full in terms of portion sizes. Very quick to be seated and then very quick food coming out. And surprisingly they did not rush you out even after you've paid the bill."
3809,14-06-2014 ,2.0,Very crowded and obviously highly advertised. The food was simply bad -- we returned one dish and barely ate the others. Service was mediocre -- surly when we insisted on returning a dish (badly cooked and unwashed prawns) and wanted to charge us for it. I would not set foot there again.
3810,13-06-2014 ,5.0,We had 6 different tapas and they were all very good We set on the bar inside but they also have a nice sitting area outside.
3811,13-06-2014 ,5.0,"I can't say anything negative about the queue as there was no line when we got there for lunch (around 12:15 PM). I saw many tourists and locals eating there as I heard Catalan and all kinds of other languages spoken by the customers. The service was great and fast, who cares if they were not Spanish. They're mostly Filipinos, BTW, not Chinese!It was honestly some of the best tapas I've had and I've had many when I would visit my sister in Seville. The price was also good, it really depends on what you want to eat. I've had more expensive tapas in the US with less food per serving. My husband, 3-year old son and I were all very happy with the food and service we received. Who cares if they're overrun by tourists. In the end, I go to a restaurant based on the quality of food and service and theirs is definitely 5 stars."
3812,13-06-2014 ,5.0,"I went Catalana with colleagues who had been before 20 years and 9 years ago respectively... it's an institution and well worth a wander just of Las Ramblas to have a bite to eat and a beer. It's a bit like having yum cha in Sydney. They are fast, efficient, it's incredibly clean and well run. The prices are a little higher than in the back streets but it is right in the thick of the tourist area so it's expected. Great meal, we tried about 8 different tapa and loved them all. It can be hard to find local food in a new city and I thoroughly recommend it. You don't get to hang around but you don't need too because there is so much else to do. We loved it."
3813,12-06-2014 ,5.0,"On my eurotrip, I came to realize after leaving France and arriving in Spain that Europe isn't real big with using Yelp. We was desperate to find a tapas place as we only had one night in Barcelona and this place popped up. We ended up trying it out and to our surprise it was better than we initially thought! First, the ambiance was amazing, they have inside dining which gives a more private setting for couples and intimate dinners and outdoor seating (where we were seated quicker) which really made you feel a part of e city. The weather was perfect, the lighting was good and the food came out quick! We ordered almost one of everything on the menu because the prices were right and we wanted to try a little bit of everything. Everything was amazing and the waiter was just wonderful. Overall such a pleasant experience and I wish we got to spend more time in Barcelona to be able to eat there again. Would definitely recommend to anyone in Barcelona and is for sure a place I'd go back to whenever I travel there again. :)"
3814,11-06-2014 ,4.0,"The tapas are divine with a wonderful selection available. The sangria is absolutely refreshing and the staff are friendly. The only downside is that it's a little pricy. Sit at the bar and pick whatever tapas you like, or sit outdoors and enjoy the lovely breeze. "
3815,10-06-2014 ,5.0,"If you are going to Barcelona you must go here. It gets very busy, and you can book a table but if you don't mind waiting try and get a seat at the bar. The staff are great, they will just keep bringing different dishes over to try until you say stop. Also, the wine is amazing. Great atmosphere and excellent food, couldn't rate it more highly. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. We were expecting the bill to be at least £80 ( we were going for second, third, forth helpngs etc.) and it was only £40, even with the wine! Fabulous."
3816,10-06-2014 ,4.0,"I've eaten here 3 times and not been disappointed. Dont let the long lines scare you. Sangria is excellent, as everything on the menu "
3817,9-06-2014 ,5.0,"we had dinner there and could enjoy some of the best tapas ever. great beef tenderloin tapa and croquetas. probably all are delicious. however, be prepared to wait for a table if you do not reserve upfront."
3818,9-06-2014 ,5.0,"As others say, there is a reason why people queue to eat here. Ok the staff aren't trying to be your best friend but they are attentive, will explain dishes and are very efficient.... Exactly what I want from waiting staff ( I used to wait in a restaurant in the UK so I should know what service should be like)Also don't believe the stories of a tourist hangout, we went on a Tuesday evening and yes there were tourists in there but also a large number of Spanish families ( adults and children)So, what do you go to Cerveceria Catalana for? The food..... You will not be disappointed.... It's is fantastic..... Highlights, chicken and ham croquets, beef tenderloin and the Catalana custard. Cost, we had 4 beers, 4 beef tenderloins, 6 croquets, mushroom and squid, 6 king prawns and 2 desserts for 52 euros..... Good value in my booksWe were lucky, we got there at 7 on a Tuesday evening and got seated straight away... When we left there was a queue of about 40..... I would gladly wait 30 minutes for a able thou..... An I hate waiting :-)"
3819,9-06-2014 ,5.0,"We stayed at an apartment nearby and ate here 3 times plus had a take out one evening. Excellent tapas quality,variety and service, meal for 4 plus wine 60 to 80 euro max. "
3820,8-06-2014 ,4.0,"We tried this place based on consistently high reviews. We had only had one prior experience with tapas in Barcelona (Bar Celta - very good) so we were still newbies in a way. The place was bustling when we arrived between 2 & 3pm. The weather was beautiful so we felt the 15-20 min wait was worth it for an outdoor table. We enjoyed various tapas based on server recommendations (mainly shellfish) and left happy. Our servers were friendly, attentive and food came rather quickly. The restaurant was clean, felt classy and easily accessible. I recommend it though there are definitely a fair number of other tourists there as other reviewers mentioned."
3821,8-06-2014 ,5.0,"Yes, it's crowded (with many tourists but also some locals), yes one has to queue...but there is a reason why many people are prepared to wait while other places nearby are half empty: the reason is simply that here you find superlative tapas, using high quality produce, and well prepared.On a recent 'brunch' visit, cockles were plump and tasting of the sea, cod with a honey aioli was out of this world, pulpo a la gallega one of the best I've tried (including in Galicia), and Jabugo was...Jabugo! For generous portions of these, plus two freshly squeezed juices, 33 euros (eating at the counter) is a fantastic price. This is a big number operation, but in the confusion there is method and organisation, and not infrequently even some smile and kindness."
3822,6-06-2014 ,2.0,"The place a very long time used to be all right, decent tapas. Now you'd be lucky to find a spot in the middle of throngs of tourists lining up as if the place had any culinary feat or a reknown chef inside. It really does not. The only reason there are so many tourists there is that hotels know the staff there speaks English (90% Chinese waiters) and that most people returned fairly satisfied. What most people don't know is that there are excellent, uncrowded places a few blocks behind where for a fraction of the money you can have a real spanish experience. At Cerveceria Catalana you'd be lucky to get good service and a real Catalan experience, not to mention hear anything but the deafening noise around as they have fit a million tables in a space made for not so many.There are millions of great places around. Don't line up airport style to eat tapas, and even less so while in Spain."
3823,5-06-2014 ,5.0,One of the best meals we've ever had. The tapas is exquisite and innovative; the atmosphere is lively. I don`t think they take reservations but it`s worth the queue. HIGHLY recommend.
3824,4-06-2014 ,5.0,One of the best tapas places we have tried. You have to queue to get a table but the wait is worth it. tapas start for 2€ and the house red wine is just 9.75€ a bottle. The prawns are amazing as is the calamari. Service is quick so don't order everything at once!
3825,4-06-2014 ,4.0,Great place with a few tables outside and lots of tables in a big spacious interior. A very nice selection of tapas all prepared how they should be. Big winner for us was the Cabreos (thin strips of potato served with sauce and an egg which the waiter cuts and mixes into the potatoes at your table). Don't be alarmed if you arrive and there is a big queue outside. Have some patience and you will be seated in 10-20 minutes. Totally worth the wait!
3826,3-06-2014 ,5.0,"I went there after the place was recommended to me by a friend, not quite knowing what to expect, and I wasn't disappointed. While the restaurant is extremely busy, both popular with tourists and local, the staff still finds time to take care of you, even if you're on your own and coming for a few tapas.Certainly the best Catanonian food I've had during my stay in Barcelona, and well worth it.My tip, arrive before 8PM if you want to avoid most of the crowds."
3827,3-06-2014 ,5.0,"These tapas are amazing and it is not touristy- a lot of locals come here. I studied abroad in Barcelona and even saw a few of my teachers here. I recommend getting here early, at least an hour or two before you want to eat otherwise make a reservation because it gets extremely crowded. Navajas are amazing here- make sure you order these as it is a Barcelona traditional dish. Some other tapas I suggest ordering are the pan con tomate, patatas bravas, calamari, but really all of them are amazing. If you are in the area definitely check this place out as it is very good. Also, try the sangria. The downside of this place is how crowded it gets, how long it takes to get a table. and very limited seating outdoors but don't let that turn you away- just make a reservation ahead of time!"
3828,3-06-2014 ,4.0,"We had a toddler with us, so we opted for outside seating. The waiter was very helpful, making suggestions of tapas he thought we'd enjoy. The food was excellent, the wine was good, the waiter attentive when we wanted to order more. I'd highly recommend Cerveceria Catalana!"
3829,3-06-2014 ,3.0,"This restaurant cerveseria was recommended by the hotel staff. This is a very touristic restaurant. They were very busy when we got there, but still have space available. It is a big place. Nice decor. The staff is nice but not extremely nice. They are just focus on attending their clients in a robotic way. Their tapas were good and nothing special. Too many tourists, obviously busier than surrounding restaurants. Maybe many hotels send their customers here."
3830,2-06-2014 ,5.0,"As foreword I must say I do not like tapas, as a concept. However, in this place I simply cannot resist trying them all!!!The place is perfect for eating great Spanish and Catalan food at any time: place is open from breakfast till late dinner. I suggest, if you make it, to sit directly at the bar and have a look to the ""tapas del dia"". Those with seafood are my favourites (try the razor clams if you never did). Just one thing to note: they do not take booking, so if you go there, you gave your name and then probably in about one hour to be seated; for the bar there is no list: just grab the first place free, order a good beer among the many and start discover Cerveceria tapas!!!"
3831,2-06-2014 ,5.0,"Our private guide, Tony from Barcelona DayTours recommended this restaurant that was close to our hotel. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a popular restaurant for locals and stays busy throughout the day; there are often lines, especially at night. There are 2 strategies to consider: the locals are in-and-out at lunch during the week, and the waits are brief; go a little earlier than customary (say 8:30pm instead of after 9:00pm) for dinner. There are long counters displaying tapas that can be selected and eaten at the counter, and tables towards the back. The decor is modern and inviting. Our group of 6 were given a table quickly and our server spoke good English. We found the Tapas to be fresh and delicious, with both traditional and new choices. The tomato bread and Iberian (acorn-fed, black pig) ham is other-worldly good. Paella of the day is served ""mediodia"" at 1:30pm, and on our day it was non-traditional conejo or rabbit that, of course, tasted like chicken! Catalana has a great selection of beers and wines, and the house wines (red and white) are outstanding. The service is paced as the dishes are brought out for sharing, and it is better not to be in a hurry. There are many restaurants in Barcelona to choose from, but if you only have time to visit one, you will congratulate yourself if you choose Catalana."
3832,31-05-2014 ,3.0,Food was generally okay but nothing special. The Spanish omelette and hamburger were nice. Portion sizes were very variable but prices were very reasonable.Was very busy and service was slow- think it has been hyped up a bit too much on TripAdvisor.
3833,30-05-2014 ,5.0,"I traveled to Barcelona with my parents (my father is 79) and my daughter (who is 10), so we had some diverse tastes to satisfy when it came to dinner. We ate at the Cerveceria Catalana our first night in Barcelona and enjoyed it so much, we went back a few days later!It's classic tapas, little plates of food to be shared, and its strength is in seafood - but my daughter enjoyed the sliders, and we also gobbled down a variety of vegetables. The wine was delicious and plentiful as well (for the adults, that is). We especially enjoyed the sardines. The atmosphere is clean & modern, and busy. Both nights we went were weeknights in February, and yet the place was packed and the wait was long. But it was worth it, and once we sat down the acoustics were good so we could sit and chat without feeling the crowd around us. Needless to say, when we revisit Barcelona, we'll go back to this restaurant!"
3834,30-05-2014 ,4.0,"There is a lot of sameness about the dishes you will find at various tapas venues in Barcelona, but this experience offers some extraordinary tastes you will not necessarily find anywhere else. We visited this very busy establishment for lunch and were very impressed. The modern interior is very stylish, but the food is the star attraction here. We were seated at a table as it was too difficult at the time to get seating at the bar. Service was adequate without being outstanding and it was difficult to get recommendations on dishes in English. Despite this we sample a mushroom stack with foie gras and a baked scallop dish that were excellent. Also memorable was Huevos Rotos-a shaved potato shoe string fries with a healthy sprinkle of paprika and topped with a soft fried egg that is mixed in with the fries at the table. We had sangrias during our lunch which had just the right amount of sugar and sharpness to cut through some of the deep fried dishes. A must do in Barcelona"
3835,29-05-2014 ,4.0,"The food is creative, tasty, not super expensive, and there is a lot of variety. The location is great, and the interior well decorated in a modern style. The staff is hurried and know that people will come there no matter what, so they are not trying hard to please guests.Despite the fact that this place has more seating than any place we saw in all of Spain, it is packed from very early till very late and the wait is at least an hour for a table on a slow night, 2+ on a busy night and the bar area is so packed that even good table-sharking takes 30 minutes.Next time we'll venture a little further to find something as good without the massive crowd."
3836,28-05-2014 ,4.0,"Highly recommended by all and it delivered, such a great place with tons of choices! Order slowly as we could not and wound up with like 20 dishes for 2! Had a drink while we waited, great place to people watch. The food was outstanding and fresh! something for everyone!"
3837,28-05-2014 ,4.0,"This restaurant was a few steps away from our hotel so we saw the huge queue late one evening and decided to eat early (British time rather than Spanish time ie 7.15pm) the next night to avoid the crowds. We still waited for 20 mins to get a table (you cannot reserve in advance) but the staff are very efficient at taking your name and organising the tables, shouting for you when ready. We had a variety of tapas, the daily specials were in Spanish but the waiter helped us with translation (we being useless British people with hardly any mastery of Spanish language). All of it was piping hot and very tasty. Prawns grilled with garlic were delicious. We had several tapas, one dessert to share, 2 beers and a bottle of house wine - 79 euros. And that was after choosing some expensive tapas dishes (the prawns and razorshell clams) - you could eat much more cheaply.I would have liked to have sat outside as it was a warm evg but there was more of a waiting list for those seats."
3838,27-05-2014 ,5.0,We were a large group. Still we got a very good table. We let them choose tapas and everyone were very satisfied. Not too pricey either. 
3839,27-05-2014 ,5.0,"I was in the mood for some really good tapas. By luck, we passed by this place and it was packed. We waited for about 40 minutes before we were able to find a place to sit. The kind staff offered us some beer while we waited. Looking at all the mouthwatering food through the glass refrigerators, we had a pretty good idea of what to order. The waitress put our food in the table and we spared no time digging in. What can I say about it other than it was truly a wonderful treet. The flavors, aromas and texture if the food was, as we thought, mouthwatering. I truly encourage you to visit this place when you are in Barcelona. "
3840,27-05-2014 ,4.0,one of the best places in town for real tapas! Dishes are quite substancious and choice is nearly endless. The only problem is that it might be too crowded so I advice not to go in rush hours.
3841,27-05-2014 ,1.0,A mix of Basque montaditos and Spanish tapas plus the chef's imagination. Very noisy. But tourists love it. Why not? It looks like the real thing. A good exploration of simulacrum. Not worth it.
3842,26-05-2014 ,5.0,Great food. Great value. Just be prepared to WAIT. We waited for close to an hour but it was totally worth it. Our best meal in Barcelona and only €40 for two of us although we ordered so much.
3843,26-05-2014 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant as it was recommended by staff at the hostel we were staying. We went early for lunch and were very impressed. The selection is phenomenal, the quality, amazing and the service excellent. We did attempt to go on another occasion in the evening, but the queues were very long, so if you want to eat at that time, it would be best to book."
3844,25-05-2014 ,5.0,"Couldn't have enough of it. The best place we ate in Barcelona, great tapas, logical prices, great quality, long queues to sit on a table, great gervice. I went there 3 times and it was just great. Only be patient, after you sit everything will work just perfect:)"
3845,24-05-2014 ,5.0,"We went to have dinner because a friend recommended this place and Indeed the food was excellent. The place is packed and the waiting was about an hour - you can register inside and outside for 2 sitting lists, and it seems like outside is faster. there is also an option to seat on the bar but on saturday night it was packed. you can also a drink outside while waiting. worth the wait!"
3846,24-05-2014 ,5.0,"I saw over 3,000 reviews and still 4.5 stars so we had to check this out! We only waited 35 minutes which we filled in by looking at the other shops in the street. The service is excellent and the food - well you can see why people wait! We got the potatoes, mini hamburgers (a must!) mini hot dogs, calamari and so much more! Oh and the warm chocolate cake is amazing!! Be prepared to wait, some other lists are longer waits (outside for example) so plan ahead, go before you plan on eating to factor in around a 45 minute wait. So glad we went!"
3847,23-05-2014 ,3.0,"This is a nice place frequented by both locals and tourists. We ate in the restaurant after about a 30 minute wait for lunch (about 3:00pm). The bar area is first come first serve, but our table opened up before the bar. The potatoes were quite good. The fried sardines were ok but we've had better. They were fresh. The Manchego cheese was quite good as was the bread. They also have a decent house red wine. Service was good and all the staff were friendly. Four tapas dishes, one glass of red and a beer cost a little more than 30 EUR."
3848,20-05-2014 ,4.0,Great tapas. High energy staff. Reasonably priced wine. Have the shrimp skewer and just about anything else! All on display and fresh (unlike some tapas bars that can make you nervous about how long they have been out).
3849,20-05-2014 ,5.0,"Don't let the long queue discourage you. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Barcelona if you're looking for local Spanish cuisine. Whenever in Barcelona, i make sure i eat there once."
3850,19-05-2014 ,4.0,"Modern and attractive. Outdoor seating available. Excellent service. Delicious assortment of tapas: Greek Salad, Eggplant/Mushroom terrine w/ warm goat cheese, prawn skewers, ham & cheese baguette, grilled asparagus & mushrooms."
3851,18-05-2014 ,5.0,"If you are going to this place, you must be prepared for crowd, noise and excellent food. It is a tapas bar. We were luck and got seats at the bar. Food is in front of you. It is so crowded that food just can not be not fresh. Simple Spanish/Catalan dishes with wine. Can taste many different things. Seafood, meat, vegetables, everything. I had a great night there. In the evening, there is a big wait list, though."
3852,18-05-2014 ,5.0,"Everything was so good!! Ordered green peppers, stuffed red peppers with cod, pork and rockofort sandwich, shrimp on skewers, pate sandwich, mini burgers, cabreaos (not sure exactly what it is, fries potatoes or onions topped with runny eggs? Just order it), fried cuttlefish, crockets, creme caramel...with some white wine phenomenal."
3853,17-05-2014 ,5.0,"Highly recommended by a spanish friend, who live in Madrid ( You can see how good it is!). Great food and the price. But recommend not to go during the dinner time, unless you prepare to wait more than an hour. "
3854,17-05-2014 ,5.0,"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday (Friday) it was quite busy. We gave our name and was told it would be 30 minute wait, but just 2 minutes later we were being seated. We chose to sit in the restaurant section, not up at the tapas bar. The wait staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The food arrived quickly and tasted amazing. We ordered the squid, croquets, black rice, white anchovies, potatoes and all of it was really tasty. However for me, the standout dish was the crispy camembert - a real treat if you like that sort of thing. Lunch cost about 50 euros but we also had a bottle of cava and a bottle of red wine. We are planning to eat there again, which is saying something considering how many great places there are to eat in Barcelona! We would definitely recommend it to others."
3855,16-05-2014 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant according to all the great reviews we read and also it was about 5 minutes from our hotel. The first night we got there around 8:30 p.m. and we were unable to get a table. They also do not take reservations so you need to get there early (5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.) if you want a table right away. They have outside dining and inside dining. We went back the next night at 5:30 p.m. after a long day of sight-seeing, had skipped lunch and so had an early dinner. This restaurant is fabulous. Their variety of tapas is huge and very interesting. The food came out quickly and always looked good and tasted even better. Try the fried artichokes, they are very good. My only problem was that we had a pretty grumpy waiter but even that did not spoil our visit to this restaurant."
3856,15-05-2014 ,3.0,"Was it worth waiting the 1 hr 10 min for? Sure. I was hungry. However, what really makes the restaurant is the atmosphere, the efficient service, followed by the food. Tasty it was -- I had the anchovies (marinated), the bravas, mushrooms and a cheese plate. Anchovies were a little salty but otherwise, everything was good -- wouldn't call it OUT OF THIS WORLD, but it was good. And the atmosphere (waiters, bartenders, hostesses) are all very courteous and friendly…which is different from what i've been witnessing recently.I only give it a rating of 3 because of the wait…but i wouldn't call it AVERAGE. IT WAS DEFINITELY GOOD and would recommend it to anyone looking for an ""experience."" :-)"
3857,15-05-2014 ,5.0,Loved this place. One of the first restaurants we tried and we had a lovely meal here. We went around 6 or so and easily got a table. But by the time we left the place was very busy.
3858,13-05-2014 ,5.0,"One of the best tapas in Barcelona. You will have to be patient., though, the place is very popular. If you are lucky to find a seat at the bar, they serve the same food as the one you get at tables"
3859,13-05-2014 ,4.0,A lot of people on Saturdays but we could seat at the bar and have lunch there :)The tapas were delicious ! We loved them!
3860,12-05-2014 ,5.0,"Fabulous evening, with fabulous food....the tapas were terrific. A bit of a mix up when we were told to go inside and find a table - which is what we did! Never mind the waiting list!! A few laughs and and little wait and we were soon seated. Had a wonderful waiter, did not have to wait long for each meal, and the ambiance is ""busy"" with all types of people. Did not think that it was too expensive."
3861,12-05-2014 ,5.0,"Right after we check in at our hotel after arriving at Barcelona from Madrid, we ask the concierge what they recommended for a quick lunch and they pointed to this place. Was not disappointed. It was so good we tried to come back here every day but it was so crowded, I have no idea how we managed to find a table for 5 the first time around so quickly.Considering the fact that I don't like seafood or anything with pork, my options were limited; I ordered the veal sirloin, shredded potatoes mixed with fried eggs, four cheeses, fried camemert cheese, and their mini hamburger. They were all great but the veal and the shredded potatoes were AMAZING. I wanted to order 5 orders of each. I wanted to go back just for those two tapas. Great, great place."
3862,11-05-2014 ,4.0,"Passed by this place on a Friday night: absolutely packed, great atmosphere, mix of young and old, spiffy casual style, with the bar crowds spilling onto the street. So, intrigued to figure out what was the hype, we went for lunch the day after and were not disappointed. A great mix of guests (just to give a hint: a couple in their 50ies on one side, a family with small kids behind us, on the other side two old ladies, in front of us a group of 5 in their 20ies, etc). All ages, all styles and - which we liked - predominantly locals. Noisy in a good way, still intimate feel. Foodwise it was good as well, nothing earthshattering but some of the tapas were excellent and really tasty. And service was superefficient. In short, great by all accounts no matter if only for a beer, a bite in the bar or seated resto (at lunch time at least)."
3863,10-05-2014 ,4.0,"I feel like this place was probably better before it gained so much popularity. It probably appears in every tourist guide, which makes it successful but soulless. There's a waiting list for a table at pretty much every hour from as early as 7pm and the bar area is so crowded it feels oppressing to eat there.On the other hand, we still waited for a table (waiting list was only 20 minutes) and were not disappointed. The food quality was great and the price was very honest, as is the service (staff was patient and informative). We paid ~45€ for a pitcher of sangria, sodas, a plate of hams and cheese, five different seafood tapas plus a tip.On the other hand, it really feels like an industry, with tables turning very fast and we felt compelled to leave as soon as we had finished. I don't know if my mind was playing tricks, but I also felt like they were segregating locals and tourists in different locations (inside/outside). The location is quite unimpressive too, on the sidewalk of a busy and noisy street.Good place if you're not in a hurry."
3864,9-05-2014 ,5.0,"In a city like Barcelona, you are going to eat very good tapas in lots of places. You may also get tired of tapas after a few days. My friend recommended Cerveceria Catalana- so we went. We go there and were told the wait would be ONE HOUR. Normally, I would never wait 1 hour to eat anywhere. It was sooooo worth the wait. They had more variety than all the other tapas restuarants we ate at over our 1 wk stay. The food was amazing. Very reasonably prices. Service was great. It is a must try."
3865,9-05-2014 ,3.0,"Just up the block from our hotel, we decided to give it a try since we had seen long lines over the Labor Day holiday weekend. On Sunday night, we still had a 45 minute wait. This is a high efficiency operation, not a place to go to try tapas in a relaxing setting. The tapas were tasty but, as I learned later, highly salted. Service was attentive to keep tables turning over fast. They obviously are successful, but we won't return."
3866,6-05-2014 ,5.0,"Sunday night we arrived at 8:30pm expecting to beat the crowd knowing most locals eat around 10pm. Were we wrong! There was already a long queue to the hostess desk. We were told 1 hrs wait. We were hurgry but it was also our first night in Barcelona. With the recommendation fromTA we decided to wait at the bar. After we got a jug of sangria, We were lucky to get a seat as the ppl next to us left. We ordered a few pinchos and happily waited. When we finally got our table, service was fast and good. Even tho the menu was in English, the specials menu was in Spanish and he patiently explained each one. We noticed we ordered more food than most tables but we enjoyed it and finished it all. We even added a half bottle of Rioja. Just perfect. But definitely order the crispy potatoes with egg and special sauce. Our favorite of the night."
3867,5-05-2014 ,5.0,"We were staying at the doubletree downtown Barcelona. The bartender recommended this place. We loved it so much we went twice in one day. Early evening quick bite and late night munchies. The shrimp was out of this world, the grilled veal was to die for. All very inexpensive served in small portions of course. Sangria was pretty good too. If you're in town or not make a point to check this place out! You will not regret it. "
3868,5-05-2014 ,4.0,"We followed the hotel reccomendation there. The food, atmosphere, staff is great. Sitting arrangement is...well out of four times we went there the fastest time we were asked to wait was 50 minutes and the longest was 1:30. We were managed tosit on the bar one time....P.SThey dont take phone reservations."
3869,4-05-2014 ,3.0,"Good food at reasonable price but very quick turnover - ,managed to get a table straight away and service was quick even though it was very busy but felt a little rushed"
3870,3-05-2014 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a bigger restaurant with plenty of people waiting for a seat. I usually look for small, local spots but since two friends recommended this place I tried it out. Good menu, good tapas and a friendly, busy atmosphere. I went twice during a ten day visit. The wait for a table wasn't long. Service: good. Space: nice, clean, comfortable. Worth a visit...or two."
3871,2-05-2014 ,5.0,"great atmosphere, crab and shrimp tapas were awsome!!! It was close to our hotel and we liked so much that we went 2 times in a week!"
3872,1-05-2014 ,3.0,"We were a bit surprised to find out this was really a place for tourists waiting in line as we has been told by friends this was a great place for tapas in Barcelona. Food was ok but bot exceptional and we didn't have to wait too long so it was ok. Surprisingly cheap for Barcelona though. Would not go back however. There are better places for tapas minus the crowds and rude waiters even on the rambla de catalunya and with much better food. One we liked was taller de tapas, they have 3-4 establishments all good."
3873,1-05-2014 ,5.0,"Ate here twice during a short break in Barcelona. Once at lunch time once late evening. Delicious tapas, the patatas bravas are great - lovely garlicky sauce. Fantastic atomosphere, busy but a great buzz. Friendly staff. The house white was lovely too!"
3874,29-04-2014 ,4.0,"Advantages:Very good quality of food, in near by of Casa Milla and Casa Batllo.Disadvantages:Very crowded place so you will have to wait for table if you don't make reservation in advance."
3875,28-04-2014 ,5.0,"Great menu offerings plus menu of the day. We had the huevos cabreados, navajas, croquetas, calamari, jabugo, pan tomate and dry manchego. Simply delicious. For dessert flan and crema catalana, superb. A bit pricier than other similar places in the area but really worth it."
3876,28-04-2014 ,5.0,One of the seemingly busiest tapas restaurants in Barcelona - but worth the wait. Bustling and fun - with amazing food. Service is quick and efficient. Try the mareco (sp?) wonderful fish dish. Fun place - lots of cross-convo between tables. Highly recommend. 
3877,28-04-2014 ,5.0,"A fashion tapas restaurant (but not so expensive).Large variety of tapas (meat, fish, crustaceans, vegetables) and express courses.Great list of beers and wines.Always full (after 8pm you can wait for a table until 1h ½ and also if you want to be seated at the bar): the restaurant manager will note your reservations and will announce your name at microphone when the table will be available.Quickly served and very big kindness by the waiters and bar men.You won’t have been in Catalunya if you’re not gone there."
3878,27-04-2014 ,5.0,"My best meal during my two-day stay. The artichokes were amazing as was the octopus and green peppers. I sat at the bar and had great service. The restaurant was busy and loud with tourists, but in a fun way. Highly recommended."
3879,26-04-2014 ,4.0,"Love it! Love it! The wait is long but you will be glad , you waited. The food melts inside your mouth. The food is fresh, amazing, and eye catching. The pulpo catalan was my favorite. The Patatas Brava exquiste. "
3880,26-04-2014 ,4.0,A lot of hype indeed but a secure place to eat in Barcelona. You eat what you want and don´t get any suprises at the end. Been there with wife and kids last week in our visit to barcelona and we had to return because everywhere else was just too much of an adventure. The food is not awesome or spectacular but everything we ate was very good. I didnt get to understand all the fuss but the truth is that I´ve been in far fussier places that are a lot worse. It is a good place to go to preferably earlier than later.
3881,25-04-2014 ,4.0,"We went there for dinner, upon a ""must go"" recommendation of a Barcelona connoisseur. The perspective of a one hour waiting for a table turned us off and instead we headed to nearby Telefèric (see my review) but decided to return for lunch the next day. This was a sound decision as we immediately got a table at around 2pm. This is not a place you visit for the décor or the ambiance (at lunch time). It is busy, filipino/a waiters run around with their traditional smile and kindness. However, the large choice of tapas, without being really creative, turned out to be excellent and fresh. Recommended, yes, but not if you look for a tapas bar ambiance, warm and relaxed atmosphere. Have lunch there, after your visit to Gaudi's house and before you walk shopping down the Rambla Catalunya.... Cost us 60 euros for about 10 tapas, a 1/2 bottle of cava and 3 glasses of red wine, which can be considered as reasonable in view of the buzz."
3882,24-04-2014 ,4.0,"We were recommended this place by friends.The food was really nice, however the staff were rushing you along so it wasn't a relaxed atmosphere.Would certainly go back ANC recommend though"
3883,22-04-2014 ,3.0,Line ups of tourists for very mediocre food in a lacklustre ambience. Don't get what all the hype is about.
3884,22-04-2014 ,4.0,The food was really nice and I didn´t really think it was that expensive. Staff could have been more friendly. Busy place!
3885,22-04-2014 ,4.0,"by the same group that is managing Ciudad Condal, the usual very long queue, so I suggest going earlier than their local dining hours. good food, friendly staff, worth it!"
3886,22-04-2014 ,5.0,"I am in love with their food. Every time visiting BCN I go there at least once. Try ""huevos cabreaos"" - the best dish on their menue."
3887,21-04-2014 ,5.0,We were in Barcelona for 5 days and this was our 'last meal' for this trip. It was as good as the best we had. Amazing tapas with a great selection of seafood and pintxos available. This is rare as most bars either were mostly specialist in one but not all three! Creme Catalan was outstanding. Place was packed but we were given a table immediately with no reservations because we were open to sitting outside on a relatively chilly day. 
3888,21-04-2014 ,5.0,Catalana is an absolute must in barselona. I had been there for several times and still asking for more. Only thing which may be annoying to newcomers is definetly the waiting over an hour in catalan rush hours. (Between 21-22:30) Have a drink and enjoy the waiting list on street. Give a try for almond coated goat cheese and catalan style french fries.
3889,21-04-2014 ,4.0,The tapas is outstanding!! And we askes for a table outside. The time for waiting inside was > 2 hours. Outside we just waited for a couple of minutes and the service while having dinner friendly and quick. 
3890,21-04-2014 ,5.0,"The long waiting line tell us a beat about the food, every minute of waiting worth. This tapas style restaurant has plenty of great curses. The mushrooms with asparagus. Prawns were also very good. We have a bottle of suvinion blanc 'Mania' which is very suitable for the sea food.One of the best tapas bar in Barcelona"
3891,20-04-2014 ,4.0,"We went here twice,once at midnight to have some tapas and the next time to have dinner. The first time it was nearly empty, second time we had to wait for an hour to have a table (take a drink and prepare yourself to queue).The tapas are really tasteful, give a try to calamaros (deep fried), awesome!"
3892,20-04-2014 ,5.0,"Yeah, it is crowded...but if you have patience you get a table in 30minutes maximum. You can look for a seat at the bar (which) I recommend because you can see what you order. The situation at the bar is ""first come, first served"" so the ""game"" of finding a seat is all yours, you do not rely on waitress! The tapas bar is open until late at night and has amazing food and nice beers and wine! The atmosphere is very nice, and it is not a tourist trap. You see many indigenous eating there! The service is quick and efficient, however, the waiters seemed sometimes pissed off with the number of orders they had and they weren't as kind as you might want them to be but nothing terrible! We spend 4 nights in Barcelona, and we went there 3 times! Why to change a place if you are satisfied? Love you Barca! "
3893,20-04-2014 ,5.0,we tried to book a table for few nights… always a que and difficult to get a tablebut this is the place where locals and other meet for a drink and food after worklot of afterwork action theregood location and a great place to go out with few friend in my view
3894,18-04-2014 ,4.0,"No doubt the food is good. If you are after good tapas, this is the place.However, you won’t be alone as it is now well known by locals and, mainly, tourists.We were sitting at the bar while plenty of people were queuing behind our back. I would not call it relaxing eating being watched all the time and having to defend the small space conquered.I suggest to go out of the main times."
3895,18-04-2014 ,5.0,We really enjoyed this restaurant. It was full of both locals and tourists and everyone was made to feel welcome as friends. Great service and food. We had one of the cheaper bottles of cava on offer and it was splendid - an ice bucket next to the table kept it cool and made us feel like we'd ordered champagne! There's a wait at peak times around 2pm and 8.30 -9pm but I'd check yourself in with the inside or outside booking desk (depending on which wait list you want to be put on) and get yourself a beer from the bar and wait. We ate twice here in this trip - sitting outside at a lunch time and inside in an evening. Both are fab. You'll love it here and there's plenty of choice - and a menu written in English if like me your Spanish is patchy
3896,17-04-2014 ,5.0,"Incredible tapas and atmosphere. There is always going to be a wait, but there are local bars you can sit at outside while you wait. A must for Barcelona dinner."
3897,17-04-2014 ,5.0,Maybe you'll need to wait but it is certainly worth it! the Hamburgersa is good and so everything else. Do your favor and Take the home cake! 
3898,17-04-2014 ,5.0,"We were told this is a tapas place for ""locals"" which is not always the best recommendation but in this case it was. A very chic local crowd jammed into this decptively large modern space at 2:30pm one Saturday afternoon. We were lucky to spy two people getting ready to leave their counter/bar seats which we were lucky enough to grab...otherwise the wait for tables was too long for our increasing appetites. Our waiter was attentive and playful with us...he couldn't really understand my Spanish so he gestured for us to point to any one of the many beautiful tapas dishes displayed on the counter which made it easy for us all. As we noticed plates of fried food, grilled food being walked by us, we pointed to those that looked particularly appealing and out waiter gladly ordered those for us, too. The only problem was that we were more than satiated but still wanted to try more food. If our trip wasn't ending the next day, I know we would have returned to try more. It was an upbeat, energetic, extremely clean and delicious dining experience."
3899,16-04-2014 ,5.0,"This is by far and away the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. Eat at the bar where its lively and fun, and you can see the dishes - pick and point if your spanish is as bad as mine. The food is simply the freshest and best quality. It also has to be the best priced place in the city for the best quality. We met locals there who wouldn;t go anywhere else, one young professional guy every weekend for the last 10 years! Get there before 1pm for lunch if you can because after that it is rammed. We went twice and had I found this place day 1 of our holiday I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else. FABULOUS!!"
3900,15-04-2014 ,5.0,"It's easy to over-hype a place but I have to admit it's justified in this case. The Maitre'd was welcoming and unassumingly left English menus as she directed us to our table. The waiter spoke fluent English (and Japanese to the 2 young girls who sat on the table next to us!) and helped explain how to order even suggesting we looked over the display at the restaurant entrance so we had a good idea of what to order. The drinks came swiftly once ordered (the Sangria made from Cava was so refreshing) and was similarly swiftly followed by the food we'd ordered.The taste of each dish was exquisite. Especially the skewered prawns and the veal (it tasted better than sirloin steak) as well as the chorizo. The desserts again were delicious, especially the Catalonion cream dish (basically local creme brûlée). Not cheap, but the quality more than made up for the cost.Someone earlier mentioned that the staff were snooty. Not at all, just damned busy! so not much time for chit-chat. As we left (about 7.30 pm) there's was a bunch of people waiting to be seated, so if you do go, go early or be prepared to wait a while.All in all an excellent experience and without a doubt we'll be back!"
3901,15-04-2014 ,4.0,"The CC is a very clean place with very nice people. The food is decent and delicious. We went a bit late and had to wait almost 1,5 hours to get a place. Of course you can go have your name written on the waiting list and stroll around. OR you could grab a drink and bite and eat outside, or by the bar. They DO NOT take reservations. So maybe a visit prior to main eating times could be a good idea."
3902,12-04-2014 ,5.0,Every dish is delicious. You must eat it once arriving in Barcelona
3903,10-04-2014 ,4.0,I really liked the food here. Tried a fair few things and everything was delicious. I did find the staff a bit snooty though. They weren't horrible but they just seemed pretty cold. The cava based sangria is highly recommended. It's much nicer than your usual sangria (which we also had). Their Iberico jamon is awesome.
3904,9-04-2014 ,4.0,"Great food, the only thing is that it takes time to understand their portions. For some items the price was ok for the portion but for example I ordered the hamburger and it was a bite size for almost 4 euros waaay to small, then the paella tapas plate was enough for one person and it was 5 euros, therefore it is tricky. But overall the food is excellent quality, you see it always crowded with locals. just like two small blocks for casa milla (gaudi)"
3905,7-04-2014 ,4.0,"5 of us decided to stop here for Sunday lunch/brunch. When we arrived the place was very busy and we were told it would be about a 40 minute wait, but much to our surprise and good luck, we were seated in about 5 minutes. The tapas and service was excellent. We enjoyed the meal with a bottle of cava. While we paid a little more for tapas here than elsewhere, the quality and atmosphere made it worthwhile. Can definitely recommend."
3906,6-04-2014 ,4.0,"We had dinner here yesterday (a Saturday). As expected it was full and crowded. Your name is put on a list and we heard we had to wait 40-45 minutes. So we took a stroll around the block, had a drink at a bar and came back after 35 minutes. Indeed there was a table for us after almost 45 minutes. We tried several tapas and a very nice Cabernet Rosado. The tapas were good, fresh and we'll prepared. Very tasty and nice looking too. All in all we had a great dinner. If you decide to go, note that after around 20:00 you're likely to have e to wait a bit but it's worth it! "
3907,5-04-2014 ,4.0,Had our dinner here on our first night in Barcelona. It was suggested by our local tour guide when we asked for a place where the locals go. Place was packed but certainly worth the wait.
3908,5-04-2014 ,5.0,"Forget the doubters, this place is great, provided that is you like olive oil, garlic and lemon. The throughput of food is frantic so everything is freshly procured and freshly prepared. They keep it simple so the quality of the produce is emphasised. We must have had seven or eight dishes, every one a winner. Also the prices are extraordinarily reasonable with the best glass of house wine I have had anywhere, any time for €2.5. The atmosphere is party like with an equal mix of locals and tourists all shouting to be heard above the din. The only drawback is the length of queue for most of the evening (>1hour) but just get a drink and wait your turn, it is well worth it and great fun."
3909,4-04-2014 ,5.0,"You should always wait for a table but it's worth it, or you can eat at the bar choosing whatever you prefer from the hundreds of different tapas they offer, if you get a table order slowly, plate by plate because they have a system that your order arrives to the table in less than 5 minutes."
3910,4-04-2014 ,5.0,"Great tapas, friendly staff, very friendly prices. A lot of people and sometimes people have to wait for a table, however this only shows how popular the restaurant actually is."
3911,4-04-2014 ,4.0,Go here and enjoy the tapas and the people watching. The variety of tapas was great and very tasty. They stay open nice and late and you should go there with a group of friends and sample a wide variety of what they offer. It is usually very crowded so be prepared for a wait but it is worth it. Enjoy
3912,3-04-2014 ,5.0,We heard there would be a long wait and almost didn't go- so happy we did! Busy upbeat atmosphere. We sat at the bar where the service was great. Lots of fish and creative dishes. Try the grilled artichoke.
3913,31-03-2014 ,4.0,"Great Tapas barFollowing were great:Serliom, Patas barabas, Pan con tomat & SangariaGood value for moneyServise is only goodCome befor rush hours (14:00 & 20:00)"
3914,30-03-2014 ,5.0,"Food was insanely good- look around for ideas on what to order or just ask your server which is the most popular dishes and go with those- those are the ones we liked the most! No line up for lunch, but a 1.5 hour wait for dinner- still, it was so good, we went there for two meals (and we never do this as we want to try as much cuisine when travelling as possible). Both locals and tourists go here- proving that it is indeed the place to be!"
3915,30-03-2014 ,5.0,"Goods quality, good prices , we where there with my wife and enjoyed the assorted tapas from the menu, with few more additions. With a bottle of wine it sets back 50 euro, considerable goods price compared to the other tourist places. You can also see that most customers are locals. The draw back is the don't accept reservations so we had to sit on the bar. With no waiting time it was ok, but with the crowed behind you, I can not say it was the most enjoyable atmosphere."
3916,28-03-2014 ,5.0,"Busy centre of City restaurant, serving great variety of delicious tapas. Sit down (reservation advised) or stand at the bar and order dishes individually."
3917,25-03-2014 ,5.0,Outdoor or indoor seating available. Tapas were great and a wide variety. Good quality. Would return.
3918,25-03-2014 ,5.0,"If you are in Barcelona you need to visit this place. There might be a wait at times, as place is very popular amongst locals, but it is definitely worth it! This is the one place that I'll visit repeatedly whenever I visit Barcelona. You wont be disappointed by the food, and the service has always been very good during our meals. Excellent place to grab a drink and taps with friends or your significant other. There are a few tables set outside. If the weather is nice, I would recommend asking for an outside table. Less crowded. If there's one restaurant you have time to visit while in Barcelona this should be it."
3919,24-03-2014 ,5.0,"This place was recommended to us by our cab driver on our way to our hotel from the train station. We were really hungry because we hadn't had lunch, so we went at 6pm. This is a strange dinner time in Spain but we needed to find something available right away. We went there and were thrilled to be shown to a table right away. Based on everything we read on tripadvisor, we were afraid we would have to wait a long time. All I can say is that the food was delicious, everything we tried was great. We saw some tapas at other tables that we would have gotten if we had had any room left because they looked amazing. They had a variety of beers available from around the world, which was a refreshing change from many places we had visited previously in Spain. So, along with that cab driver, I would recommend this place very highly and we will go back when in Barcelona again."
3920,23-03-2014 ,4.0,"on our first night in the city, we were still getting used to the fact that people eat so much later than in the US. we happen to stumble upon this place around 7:30pm and it was hopping. the food was delicious and very reasonable. service was good and pretty quick. i would totally recommend it! plus, we spent 20 euros for light snacks and drinks for 2 of us"
3921,23-03-2014 ,4.0,"Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious, fresh and tasty. Service is ok, since they really are fast and efficient.Arrive before 13h for lunch otherwise you'll face the lines."
3922,23-03-2014 ,5.0,"I went to the Cerveceria Catalana following the suggestion of the waiter of my hotel and with some doubts, because I normally don't like the crowd places. We waited 45 minutes, but it was really worth. We had very good food and wine, the waiter was really friendly, the price was good.And consequently we returned the night after !"
3923,22-03-2014 ,5.0,"This was our first stop after settling into our hotel. Cerveceria Catalana was recommended by our hotel but we checked them out on TA adviser before going. The great reviews confirmed the concierges' recommendation. We arrived a bit late and had to stand in line but it was worth the wait. The restaurant seats many and there are two tapas bars and outdoor seating. The restaurant seemed to be full of locals which we took as a good sign. Because of the wait, we were able to admire many of the tapas choices at the bar. Once seated, our waiter was excellent in helping us with our selections. We returned a few days later for breakfast and it's obvious that the locals like it, too. Treat yourself to a few meals here."
3924,22-03-2014 ,5.0,Had an absolutely delicious lunch here.Service was fast but friendly.Very extensive and interesting menu of both tapas and pintxos. Excellent quality food but at an affordable price. Only discovered this place on our last day and we were really sorry that we didn't have the time to go back for more. It will be my first port of call next time I visit Barcelona!
3925,20-03-2014 ,4.0,"Fast paced restaurant, quick meal delivery and great sangria....Tapas was great and delicious, a bit more flavouring then other tapas restaurants(super fresh food) we been to, food was quick, good value for money too. A famous tapas place to visit while you are in town....Question is, do you have the time to wait in line to be seated?? there were other tapas restaurants around that were equally good....... but you know with this place, you know you are getting good tapas...."
3926,20-03-2014 ,4.0,"Loved the salteado del dia: mushroom ham and asparagus, huevos cabreaos, calçots with romanescu sauce, and small white anchovies fritos. Super-fast service: we ordered five plates and they were all brought instantly - if you want a slower pace, I guess you have to ask."
3927,19-03-2014 ,5.0,"Sought out this place because of the great reviews here. Not too far off the Passeig de Gracia. Had a short wait of about 10 minutes and at lunch time, the place was very busy.our first time ever happing tapas together and we had so much sea food the night before that we didn't want much this time, but there was a lot of choice. In the end we had-mini burgers, cheesey potato croquettes, patatas bravas, cod skewer, prawn skewer, canneloni and veal.The veal was literally one bite so but apart from that, everything was just delicious and I'd definitely go again. We ordered a full size bottle of cava and the bill was just 45 euros. Amazing!"
3928,18-03-2014 ,4.0,"Wonderful tapas bar with great service, atmosphere but most of all great food! Compliments to Danni and his team behind the tapas bar!!! Reserve in advance or be prepared to lounge at the cosy tapas bar amongst locals. Order a cocktail or sangria whilst Enjoying true Spanish tapas.The four from Holland!"
3929,18-03-2014 ,4.0,"This is a great tapas bar, everything is super fresh and tastes good, fun vibe, decent prices,quite the Barcelona experience. We had the camembert crudite, asparagus and mushrooms, bravas, everything was quite good. We waited about half an hour on a Tuesday night and about 8, and sat at a table with another couple but with empty chairs between us. The place is packed so the service is very quick and to the point, the food is very good but not special, and for a meal out you really can't go wrong here. If you are looking for exceptional food or romance this is not the place, if you are looking for a tasty, fresh, fun meal, definitely come here."
3930,18-03-2014 ,5.0,"You should definetely go there.there will be long queue but never mind, wait for it. Best tapas, really good desert and wine."
3931,17-03-2014 ,5.0,"Not much to say as a great place with delicious tapas and only tapas. Thus its a good place, there are many people and so its bit crowdy. But i will go there again and again."
3932,16-03-2014 ,5.0,"With no booking, be prepared to wait (just over an hour for us - so we went to a near by bar after we had registered our names) it is however well worth the wait - superb & imaginative Tapas - the biggest risk is ordering too many things because there is so much you'd like to try "
3933,16-03-2014 ,5.0,"The most difficult thing you will experience is to come to a decision what nót to choose from the menu. Otherwise: sit outside, have a lemonbeer, pick a couple of things you've never had before, or oldtime favourites and just enjoy. This is what tapas where meant to be like. Fresh (which means they will have run out on certain dishes), simple, delicious. Great service. Personal favourite: fried little fish and pimientos de padron, with a Damm lemonbeer! Highly recommended :-)"
3934,15-03-2014 ,5.0,"We were here in the afternoon, around 5. The place was busy but we could find a table outside. The service was quick. They have a great variety of tapas and everything is fresh. Our favourite were the chicken croquettes, grilled mushroom and the mini squids. The creme brulee was nice as well, although the sugar a bit burnt on the top. Even so, I would recommend it without a doubt."
3935,13-03-2014 ,4.0,Our hotel receptionist told us to go there and it was very good. Very friendly service. Mixed tapas was nice and the prices are okay. We will go there again this week. 
3936,13-03-2014 ,5.0,"Everything was great at this restaurant especially veal on bread, bravas potatoes and variaties of good beer! The waiter was very helpfull with the selection and they taste good as well. "
3937,11-03-2014 ,5.0,"This was the best restaurant we went to in Barcelona! Out of 4 days there, we went to this restaurant 4 times! The tapas were great and always fresh. I would definitely recommend this reastaurant to anyone. I especially loved their croquets!"
3938,11-03-2014 ,5.0,"No bookings. Full of locals mainly because it's very central, good value for money and fast serviced. Don't expect a fancy restaurant, but good food, quality and variety of freshly made tapas."
3939,11-03-2014 ,4.0,"This is one of my favourite restaurants for ""Tapas"",I enjoy going there when I am in that partof town.The ""montaditos"" de cangrejo are really good,If you go at lunch time, you may have to wait for a table , but usually you don't have to wait too long . Week-ends is a different matter, as a lot of locals like to go there for lunch and dinner, so try and get there early."
3940,11-03-2014 ,4.0,Local Catalans are deprived of going more frequently to this place. It is crowded with foreigners. It is almost a must to visit it while in Barcelona...and that is the problem. Tapas are excellent. Service is very good and superfast (they want you out as soon as possible to serve other people). Try as many tapas as possible and skipe regular dishes that you can eat somewhere else. I cant give five starts because of the waiting time. If this is too crowded for your patience try Ciutad Comtal. Same owners. Same menus.
3941,11-03-2014 ,3.0,"Again all the possetive feedback we rejoiced and eat tapas here. But unfortunately we were very disappointed. It must be said that the quality of the food was of a very high class, however. The service was below average and the place was extremely noisy. We were very uncertain about some Spaniards would choose this place. With family or as a romantic place for dinner, we selected a completely different place. Are you a band out on the town, it would be very nice here."
3942,11-03-2014 ,5.0,"One of the best tapas places I´ve been to in the city! It was a tad crowded, so aim for going during the off hours during lunch time (before 2 and after 5) or dinner time (before 8). Reasonably priced and great quality of food! The staff also speaks English well for those who are not Spanish-speaking travelers."
3943,11-03-2014 ,5.0,"Aside frm wonderful food all day long, this place is very lively for breakfast. Huge array of delicious thin baguette sandwiches, helpful and speedy staff and good coffee. Start off your morning with a quick bite here."
3944,11-03-2014 ,5.0,You cannot go to Barcelona without trying the fantastic beer and food this restaurant presents. I have not been over in Catalonia in a while and that is one of the things I miss the most.
3945,11-03-2014 ,3.0,"It shouldn't have that name being not representative of Catalan cuisine at all. May look good to tourist, but the quality is above average and very expensive."
3946,11-03-2014 ,5.0,"The Cervesaria Catalana is as popular with locals as it is with tourists. For good reason, the food is excellent, the service is excellent; its popularity is well deserved. There is hardly an hour of the day that there is no waiting line, but waiting can be fun as you can order tapas and drinks in the reception/bar area while you wait. Can't beat this place for good food. Only negative is that the dining, sit-down area was expanded a few years ago and that area is lacking in charm.If you are lucky enough to get a table on the street you have had the best experience you can have here."
3947,10-03-2014 ,5.0,"We went here following a recommendation from our hotel, and to our surprise it turned out to have the same menu as the place we'd been to the previous evening, the Ciutat Comtal. Not a problem, since we'd really enjoyed eating there.We were told 20 minutes wait for a table, but in fact our name was called in less than 5 minutes. We had tomato bread, a few tapas, all nice, a couple of glasses of wine, a Guinness and an ice cream, and the bill was just under €40. No wonder there's a crowd waiting to get in!"
3948,6-03-2014 ,5.0,"Oh my gosh, this place was delicious!!! The food here was GREAT, wow, worth the wait which you will definitely have for dinner and even for lunch.If you don't eat at the tapas bar area, make sure you ask what you are looking at because the items at the bar are not on the menu, and trust me, you will want them! Most notably the ""Montaditos"" which change regularly.Service at dinner time was EXCELLENT probably because they want to get people in and out relatively quickly because of the wait. (But, we did not feel rushed, just well attended to!) Lunch time they were much less attentive but the food was still awesome!"
3949,28-02-2014 ,5.0,This restaurant just serves tapa but is not the usual bar but modern finishing. Excellent food and good service 
3950,27-02-2014 ,5.0,Simply one of the best tapas in Barcelona. Reasonably priced quality wine as well.But don't show up at the last minute expecting to get a table without waiting.
3951,26-02-2014 ,5.0,"To go before, between or after meals. Good appetizers and drinks. A famous place in town, always full.of.happy people."
3952,26-02-2014 ,5.0,"The food is fresh vibrant and service is friendly, not over priced we had 8 plates of tapas and two glasses of wine and the total was €38 which is great value for money considering the quality of the food, busy restaurant so don't except to walk straight in and get seated straight away but thats a sign of a great restaurant will be back next time we visit Barca"
3953,25-02-2014 ,4.0,"Great tapas, good wine, stylish people, a good mix of locals and tourists, a very friendly atmosphere,"
3954,22-02-2014 ,5.0,"We arrived at about 7pm and had a 20 minute wait for a table of 2. Just as we were getting seated, another couple arrived and the wait had gone up to 50minutes, so get here early, it's really popular; always a good sign!The service was very attentive, we had drinks orders taken quickly and were given as much time as we wanted to look at the menu. We had a drink each, plus water, and several different tapas dishes for a reasonable 30€. The prawn skewers are incredible, and we enjoyed the local calçots. The cured ham plate was great as well! For dessert, we tried the pumpkin cake which was lovely. Well worth the wait, I'll definitely be coming back!"
3955,22-02-2014 ,5.0,Mixed tapas plate is cheap and amazing prawns! Great little front opens into massive restaurant. Love this place visited twice in two visits! Non nom
3956,20-02-2014 ,5.0,"We went on a recommendation from our hotel porter. The restaurant is popular with locals as well as tourists and can get very busy - go early. Helpful waiting staff who took the time to explain how tapas work to us. we had a lovely mix of dishes - a pile of small peppers, stuffed red pepper, squid, achovies and then we had paella, all washed down with a delicious local beer. Prices seemed reasonable and we ate an evening meal there, with wine and coffee for a little over 50 euros. We will definitely return there when in Barcelona. Great tapas bar/restaurant in a great location and a good atmosphere."
3957,19-02-2014 ,4.0,"This place is extremely popular but once you're lucky enough to get a table you find out why - the tapas are delicious. The prices aren't ridiculous and I found the drink prices to be extremely reasonable and the pours were definitely generous. Between my co-worker and I, we ordered about 10 different tapas and each one was perfectly prepared and fresh and delicious."
3958,19-02-2014 ,4.0,"Very crowded place. But its definitely worth the wait! The best tapas in Barcelona, we loved the Huevos Rotos more than in any other place. We had buñuelos with crema catalana for dessert, don't miss it! "
3959,19-02-2014 ,4.0,"The first time I came here, I was disappointed by the food. It was a Saturday night in February and we waited an hour for a table for 4 at 9:30 pm. I thought the patatas bravas were just a little too plain (drizzled in what tasted like mayo with only a small thing of marinara sauce at the side). The octopus was tough. The sangria tasted too much like vodka.The second time, Cerveceria Catalana redeemed itself. The line was much more manageable on a Monday night at 8:30 pm (i.e. nonexistent), and since my friend and I were early we seated ourselves at the bar where we got some delicious pimientos padron and a mushroom plate. I stuck to the house wine, a deal at 2.10 euros, and had the veal and prawn skewers and razor clams. They were all amazing. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back again!The service was eh both times. I would say as a single traveler or a couple, eat at the bar instead. You get the same food with much quicker service, plus it's so much more lively."
3960,19-02-2014 ,5.0,i found this restaurant on tripadvisor then we decided to try. this is really popular restaurant. i went there at 23:00 still tables were busy. we sat at bar. we ordered 4 tapas and 1 bottle red wine.. they are delicious and staffs are so kind. totaly we paid 35€ .. this is normal for barcelona. i really loved to be there. you need to try too..
3961,19-02-2014 ,5.0,"I went with a friend, arriving rather late at about 11 pm. But the place was jam packed with diners and overflowing with customers waiting on tables. There were only two of us, but it still took over an hour to get a table.We sat inside (the outside bit closes by 12:30 or so due to local rules/regs about noise disturbing locals in apartments nearby). We ordered a pitcher of cava sangria (cava being the Spanish version of champagne). I didn't know this drink existed, but it went down very smoothly.Then we proceeded to order tapas. Their selection is ample and absolutely delicious. Even their french fries come with a heavenly sauce."
3962,18-02-2014 ,5.0,we passed this place on Saturday night 10 o'clock and people were queuing outside to get a table. the next night it had a wait of 20 minutes which was doable and well worth it once you taste their tapas 
3963,17-02-2014 ,3.0,"It is kind of very busy place, after 7pm you will be placed to waiting list only. It means a lot of people visit this place and I think it is because of the quality of food which is really OK. Not excellent but OK. But service was poor without any effort to help us translate daily offer of tapas :-("
3964,16-02-2014 ,5.0,"We waited 30 min. at queue to enter. With the advice of a local customer we ordered 8 different plates. Tapas with ham, shrimps, vegetable salad, meat, tomatoes and patatas bravas(fried), mushroom plate, fresh onions and a bottle of merlot and paid 75€. Try patatas bravas, tapas with meat and shrimps. "
3965,13-02-2014 ,4.0,"Great place to have tapas in Barcelona. If you are not in a hurry and can wait to sit at the bar it worth the wait. You sit in front of gorgeous assortment of tasty tapas. We've had better ""patatas bravas"" but The other choices did not disappoint. Do visit the restaurant if you are in Barcelona, it is worth it!"
3966,12-02-2014 ,5.0,Really hard to decide what to eat... everything is good. I think is an excellent chance to try spanish tapas. Try it!!
3967,11-02-2014 ,5.0,"Fresh,delicious food. Friendly and helpful service. Menu had great diversity, wine list was reasonable, with a number of choices. Lively atmosphere, but not rushed."
3968,11-02-2014 ,5.0,"If you are visiting Barcelona make the effort to go a little bit out of your way to find this place. You might have to wait for either a bar stool or a table but it really is the best food and the prices for the drinks are very, very good too. The quality of the food is fantastic and you can just go up to the food on show to explain what you would like. The service if really quick. We booked our hotel to be near this place as we have been here before and on the latest trip we went three times as we tried others and there was no comparison."
3969,10-02-2014 ,5.0,"Hi, This is the best Tapas I have ever had, and trust me I am particular when it comes to food. The food was fantastic and I would highly recommend this place if you live in or visit Barelona!"
3970,9-02-2014 ,5.0,"I haven't been in Catalana for several years but I found it all the same. Open early, NO reservations !!, wonderful tapas and nice atmosphere. You sit at the bar while waiting for a table and taste of the dishes presented there. Waiting for the next visit"
3971,7-02-2014 ,5.0,"The receptionist at the Alma Hotel recommended this tapas restaurant, so we went lo and behold at 8.00pm on a week day it was busy, always a good sign, we put our names down for a table and were asked to come back around 9.30pm, I really really do not do waiting, but as the food going past us looked fabulous I surprised myself in taking a relaxed attitude.All staff members spoke good English that we came into contact with, food was superb, bill at the end was quite reasonable we were impressed that we came back for 3 nights, shortest wait was 30 minutes."
3972,6-02-2014 ,4.0,"This restaurant is always super busy, it seems to have the tourist that come at 6- 6.30 and the locals that arrive 9pm onwards.They have english menus, but restricted, the staff, speak fairly good english, but as the place is always packed don't expect a great conversation.It's a little like yum-cha in chinese restaurants, you sit-order-eat and go!!But the food is great."
3973,4-02-2014 ,3.0,"Went there with friends for a lunch.The food was really good, worth a try.The service is a big mess/factory kind. The waitress came to get our order, we asked a question, she replied and left immediately. Fortunately, another guy took our order later.Food was really good, but they forgot to bring one beer and sangria had so much ice - tasted like water.You can go there for a good food, but the rest is awful."
3974,3-02-2014 ,5.0,"I had dinner here. 4 times, breakfast once. Dining solo at the Tapas bar was a revelation. Literally hundreds of amazing selections. Great wines by the glass. Always pumping. Loved it to death. Xxx"
3975,25-01-2014 ,4.0,"If you arrive after 8pm, you need to wait min 30, max 90 min. for a table. It is very long time. No reservation. If you arrive in time, or you are lucy you can wait less. The service seems to be caotic, but very fast. This is not the ideal place for a romantic dinner, but the ideal for group of friends. They have not englis menu, and the english of the waitress is not to good, they can not recommend anything. The service was very fast, the dishies are tasty but not specific."
3976,25-01-2014 ,5.0,"Atmosphere of Barcelona, we recommend sitting at the bar. Excellent tapas,service is good and fast.you can not book in advance...."
3977,25-01-2014 ,1.0,"I went to this restaurant yesterday ... I didn't like it at all, food was very oily , very ordinary , waiters press you to command and leave fas, prices however remain reasonable.."
3978,24-01-2014 ,4.0,This place has the best Tapas in Barcelona the choice is amazing and you can't go wrong. The prices are fair we were 8 people we gorged ourselves with Tapas wine and beer +deserts and including tips we paid less than 30€ PPThe only problem with this place is that it's always packed and crowded you can't book in advance and the waiters are running around without too much time to serve...but maybe that's the shick of this placeI will certainly return....
3979,23-01-2014 ,5.0,"This was one of the Tapas bars we enjoyed the most. The prices were reasonable for the area and the selection was very good. Depending on the time of day there could be a long wait, we found that before 3pm and after 7pm were the busiest times so we went around 5pm - 6pm and had either a very short wait or no wait at all.The staff was very friendly and helpful and seemed to all speak English. If you are not sure what an item is just ask. Or ask for your favorite type of food and they may even suggest something that you may not have noticed.If you want a good Tapas experience, this place will not disappoint, you just have to avoid the crowds because I think both locals and tourist are lining up to get a seat. If you want a seat at the bar just grab one that is available, otherwise put your name on the list and wait for a table."
3980,23-01-2014 ,4.0,"For me the whole part of the experience of tapa is sitting by the bar and enjoying people watching and checking out all the foodie delights at the bar. This place doesnt disappoint...what did was being sat at a table in a massive restaurant. We promptly left and returned to wait for a seat at the bar. The ambiance, atmosphere and the flurry was exactly what we were looking for. The tapas was great as was a serve of stirfry veges that were freshly prepared...absolutely delicious! Not the most authentic but delicious nevertheless!"
3981,22-01-2014 ,5.0,Most of the crew know English and we were Explained about the types of dishes.I enjoyed the busy environment and good food. Very clean and modern decoration.
3982,21-01-2014 ,5.0,"We enjoyed our meals here that in 3 days we went back 3 times! Each time we tried a few new tapas and shared a jug of delicious Sangria or a bottle of wine. It was inexpensive and worth it. You must try the grilled veal--around a 2 oz piece of the most tender, delicious filet grilled rare and served a top a piece of grilled baguette with a pepper, it was our favorite tapa by far. You could cut through the meet with the fork! Also try the warm escalivada with goat cheese--your taste buds will be delighted!"
3983,21-01-2014 ,5.0,We go to this tapas restaurant every single time we go to Barcelona. The staff is very nice and the food is amazing. There is is always a wait but it is well worth it.
3984,20-01-2014 ,5.0,"there are a number of reviews which talk about waiting for service, we were hungry and went in at about 7.30 and had a table straight away, it was still buzzing and very busy. Service was quick and our waitress was friendly. When your just looking for something good to eat without fuss it was perfect."
3985,20-01-2014 ,5.0,"Our sons live in Barcelona and so we know this restaurant.It is one of the best for""tapas"". The service is very good and the food excellent. The best is to eat at the bar.It is very popular and a bit touristic so queues are inevitable but worth the wait!"
3986,20-01-2014 ,4.0,"Good fresh traditional tapas and some modern variants. Always full at peak times so also be prepared to wait. Prices have gone up as it is now on the tourist route, sadly."
3987,20-01-2014 ,4.0,"Good place for traditional tapas. Nothing fancy, but decent quality. Quite a touristy place but still visited by locals. I like the mixed sea food salad and the pinxo with the filet is good too.Just a shame the service is not great. But as it is quiete bad in most of the places in Barcelona it´s nothing too disturbing"
3988,20-01-2014 ,4.0,"Very good Tapas, but long waiting time for table... Always very busy, but the food is extraordinary! A wonderful experience!"
3989,19-01-2014 ,4.0,"Recommended by our hotel. Arrived quite late and the inside was full.Took a table on the street under a lovely heater.Service was excellent, food OK and house wine very nice.All for a reasonable price."
3990,19-01-2014 ,3.0,"Due to good reviews we visited this restaurant. Tapas is the best, that is really true. However it is a huge restaurant and it gives you the feel that you are pushed through the production line. Waiters are waiting behind you to take a new order. After 40 minutes we were outside again. Not really the type of evening we were aiming for..."
3991,18-01-2014 ,5.0,Amazing gambas roja....best tapas in that strip - no other compared in my week stay in Barcelona. CROWDED but worth the wait. Servers are efficient - thanks to the Pinoy servers there! I went back multiple times....wish I can take the food w/ me! hahahaha Unbelievably reasonable priced too considering quality of food...
3992,16-01-2014 ,5.0,"Stayed in Barcelona early Jan 2014, found this bar on arrival, and what a find, excellent food and service, very popular, so queues enevitable, but well worth the wait, used it most days for lunch."
3993,16-01-2014 ,4.0,"Nice place and food. Service is okayish. Long wait, but the montadito de camembert crujiente is fantastic. Worth the wait!"
3994,16-01-2014 ,5.0,"Arrived late(9pm) in Barcelona with a colleague and we asked the hotel for a tip on which tapas bar, she recommended this place and we weren't disappointed. Arriving there was a real buzz about the place both inside and out, populated by locals more than tourists which is always a good thing in my mind. We put our name on the list and were seated within 15mins. From that point on the service was attentive and the food exceptional - we had a mixture of cold and hot, meat and fish, vegetables etc. as you do in a tapas bar... the timing of food was nicely spread out and of course an opportunity to order more if required. We also drank cerveza on arrival and red wine with our meal - both I found to be very reasonably priced for such a quality destination in the centre of town."
3995,15-01-2014 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to me by family and since our hotel was close to it we ended up going there multiple times during our trip! There's always a long wait - expect 30 minutes or more - but it's well worth it!!! Tapas is delicious (get the fried green peppers, the octopus/squid, and any of the ham sandwiches!!) and service is fast, friendly and efficient!"
3996,12-01-2014 ,5.0,"This Tapas restaurant was recommended to us by the staff in our hotel. And what a great tapas place it was. You could either sit at the bar and choose tapas or take a table in the restaurant area. It was really busy when we got there at eight thirty, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The waiter was really efficient and helped us to choose the food, as we had no real experience of how much to order. The bill was pleasantly a lot less than we were expecting."
3997,10-01-2014 ,5.0,"My husband, daughter and I tried five of the tapas from the Tapas del Dia menu: red prawns, tri-colored artichokes, vegetable tempuras, long clams and a small plate of vegetables with mozzarella. We also ate bread with a raspberry/tomato salsa. The presentation was beautiful and the food plentiful, tasty and fresh. We ate outside because, even at 8pm there was a 40 minute wait for an inside table., so get here early! Service is excellent and quick. The three of us ate all this and a bottle of excellent red wine for about 55 Euros. What a deal!"
3998,9-01-2014 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana has great tapas, especially everything from the sea but also cheese dishes and meat. Everything is very fresh and you are always surprised how cheap everything is when you receive the summarization. Dont be afraid to wait a couple of minutes because you will be seated, but beware of that this is a very ""hip"" place recommended by lonely planet which will attract local and far tourists, so it will be crowded. To be certain to not be pushed around come a couple fo hours early around 6pm and enjoy a couple of dishes and when it gets crowded you can sneak away to a more quiet bar enjoying some drinks. ¨No table reservations and sharpen your elbows!"
3999,9-01-2014 ,5.0,"i visited Cerveceria Catalana 4 times during september 2013 and it was excellent. I've visited Barcelona several times and without question this has been the best Tapas bar I've eaten in.The food is delicious, very well priced and the wine is great too. you can eat and drink like a king here and spend less than £40. Cerveceria Catalana typifies tapas, busy, sociable and fresh tasty food.You must eat here!"
4000,6-01-2014 ,5.0,"Excellent food, good prices! The service is ok. Great variety of tapas!. The restaurant is nice and beautiful. I really liked this place, I fell in love with the Jamón Jabugo!You have to come early otherwise it could be crowded."
4001,4-01-2014 ,5.0,"It was recommended by our hotel staff (we stayed nearby). What a great place! Tapas were great, fresh and tasty and promptly served despite busy hour. Modern ambience, tapas are both classical and contemporary. Friendly service.Our tip: come outside of normal lunch/dinner"
4002,4-01-2014 ,5.0,"Although waited for more than 30 mins to get a table, I enjoyed the food there a lot. One tiny tip to eat a good meal in Barcelona is ""Avoid the place where tourists eat, search for the locals' places"". And this place is a a very popular place among the locals.A must try there is the Catalan style creme. Strongly recommend."
4003,3-01-2014 ,5.0,What fun meals here with so many choices of tasty tapas. The atmosphere is a bit crazy and crowded and may require a wait. But the food was excellent and the prices reasonable.
4004,3-01-2014 ,4.0,"Great Tapas, perfect if you new to Barcelona, or returning, safe bet for good food.Love this place, eaten many time here. The Tapas is good. The salads are well made and tasty. Love their fish and beef dishes.Have the steak tapas, Russian salad, deep fired anchovies. Stick to the traditional dishes and you will love it. Not a fan of their deserts and tend to avoid. Yes, they don’t do reservations, yes you may have to wait if you turn up during tourist and/or local dinner time. Go outside these busy hours and it’s easy to get a table. Smile be polite and make sure to catch the hostess eye every now and then, and she will be nice and get you a table as quick as she can. Awesome place if you a bigger group and willing to wait for a table."
4005,3-01-2014 ,5.0,"Having been here before so we knew we would have to wait for a table, about 45 minsThats not so bad as you can have a drink and study the menu whilst you wait.As before there was plenty to choose from and the prices of the Tapas were very reasonable,and tasted lovely, even the bar prices are quite cheap compared with other establishments, are large beer and white wine for €5:20.I don't understand some of the bad revues as we have been here 5 times now and never had a bad experience, we wern't rushed at all and kept ordering more as we went along. Will return the next time we are in Barcelona."
4006,3-01-2014 ,5.0,"From our expirience one of best tapas bars in Barcelona. If you choose right time (before 8pm) there is fair chance you'll get the table quick. I expected higher prices, but the prices are just slightly up from tons of other bars wich really can not compete with food quality here. Highly reccommended !"
4007,3-01-2014 ,4.0,"there's a reason why people wait upwards of an hour to be seated...top-notch tapas served in a lively, energetic setting. as they don't take reservations, and we had heard the wait is often long, we strategically chose a very late lunch (even by Barcelona standards). We were told it would be 30 minutes, but then saw two stools open at the bar. Same menu, same service, with 20 min less to wait. In fact, I could argue the bar experience is far better and more interesting than table service, as you have all the tapas right in front of you and the ability to get advice and recos from the staff. the only drawback was wanting to try everything in front of us! I would highly recommend this restaurant. Last piece of advice - sangria was good, but not great. opt instead for a glass (or bottle) of Cava, or a beer."
4008,2-01-2014 ,2.0,"The tapas are ok, but not more - and not worth waiting in line for 1/2 to over 1 hour. Staff is far from welcoming, looking for the highest possible turnover. In short: overrated."
4009,2-01-2014 ,5.0,It's considered to be one of the best tapas bars in Barcelona and it definitely is. You will have to wait to get a table but it is worth waiting. Tapas taste very good and the price is really ok. Can't understand those saying it's overrated. Dogs are allowed only outside 
4010,2-01-2014 ,5.0,"Found this place by accident after visitng Casa Batilo and tried to get in for lunch but it was crammed and lots of people waiting so we came back in the evening and had such a great time. We just kept ordering - pointing at what other people had, what was displayed on the counter and was being freshly cooked and appearing out the kitchen. Delicious. We had a designated waiter who was really sweet and very attentive - perhaps they are on commission?! We stopped at a few other tapas bars that evening and nothing compared to this.Quite hard to get a seat, it is a bit of a scrum and if you leave your seat for more than a couple of seconds, someone is in it!"
4011,2-01-2014 ,5.0,"I have heard a lot about this restaurant, and I must say once I tried it I went there 3 nights in a row. I had to queue for at least 30 min but its absolutely worth it, the place is magic full of tourists and local trendy people absolutely the place to be seen in Barcelona,I don't know how to explain how great the food is so just WOWdon't miss on this experience especially if like me you love Tapas and real fresh fish"
4012,2-01-2014 ,5.0,"My girlfriend and I went here 1st of Jan. and had the best tapas of our trip to Barcelona. The jamón was very tasty, the manchego was good quality, and the baby squid was amazing. Moreover, we had tempura vegetables with romesco and very delicious fried artichoke which was like artichoke chips. It's quite busy so book in advance or be prepared to wait a bit. It seemed there was a good mix of locals and tourists which was nice as the staff knew English but it still had a local feel. Our top choice for tapas!"
4013,2-01-2014 ,5.0,"I'm not usually a fan of tapas what with being a vegetarian but this place pleasantly surprised me. The Spanish do like to eat later than us Brits so expect a hefty queue if you visit any time after 830. We got in no problem at 730 but it was a Wednesday evening. Didn't think much to the décor but never mind. We were on business so my Spanish (well Catalonian) colleague ordered for us a selection of vegetarian and meat tapas. I particularly enjoyed the Patas Bravas which came with a tomatey sauce and a bit of aioli drizzled on top. I also ordered deep fried camembert dish which arrived on a skewer, coated in nuts and breadcrumbs with a berry dip - delicious! Dessert was also lovely, I had the crème brulee. seemed to be popular with tourists, everyone was British or American."
4014,2-01-2014 ,5.0,"The great choice of beers attracted me to this place, but the Tapas was also tasty with so much choice it was mouth-watering.. We would have waited 40 minutes to be seated inside, but grabbed a couple of seats at the bar in the meantime. As the waiting system seemed to very chaotic.They have about 20 different bottles of beer, one of which was from Catalunya which I was drinking called Almogaver Classica, a amber ale."
4015,2-01-2014 ,5.0,Went to Cerveceria Catalan on the recommendation of the concierge at the W. Only negative thing to be aware of is that you cannot make reservation and the wait is about an hour. Howevere once you get a table or in our case the counter it is a lot of fun. Good service and great food.
4016,30-12-2013 ,5.0,"Yes, you have to wait. And yes, it is well worth it. Our mouths were watering as we stood at the entrance and watched the tapas being served at the bar (no queue at the bar; just nab a seat if you can). The presentation, variety, creativity and freshness are enough to blow you away. The service was friendly and attentive. The food is outstanding and the price is very reasonable. An absolute must for those visiting Barcelona."
4017,30-12-2013 ,5.0,"Wonderful. No pre booking possible. Need to show up in advance for reservation 30 min to 1 h later but it worth waiting. This is always full. Good tapas, efficient service and cheap. Can eat 5 tapas for less than 10 ?.To avoid waiting this is possible to eat at the bar. Just take a seat when someone is leaving. ;)"
4018,29-12-2013 ,5.0,This was the first restaurant I have tried in Spain. I sat outside with two friends and we had amazing tapas and beer at a very reasonable price. Everything was delicious and they were really nice.
4019,28-12-2013 ,4.0,"Provided you re ready to wait for an hour before you get a table, really good place for tapasWill return now i understood you can grab any sit at the counter when available"
4020,27-12-2013 ,5.0,"My wife and I traveled to Barcelona on a whim a couple days ago. As with every occasion that is unplanned, we have had great times and found extraordinary places. Our son in law recommended this place and we went there today. What am amazing time!!! We sat a the bar, engaged I'm lively repartee with the locals, ate mostly from the day menu and had a most wonderful experience. The long wait notwithstanding, it was well worth it. If you want to sample real Catalonian food and enjoy a festive atmosphere, this is one of the places to visit in Barcelona."
4021,26-12-2013 ,4.0,"This place was so highly recommended, that we headed there our first night in Barcelona. It was busy, a little noisy and a great place to feel you were indeed finally back in Barcelona. We went early, as suggested, and were quickly seated. The service was excellent. Some of the tapas choices were excellent as well. A shrimp risotto was delicious. Large, grilled shrimp - excellent as well. For one of our party, who was not very adventurous this first night in Spain, the small Iberian ham and cheese on a mini-baguette was a perfect choice. The disappointment was that the selection of fried fish - and a separate tapas of a different fried fish - all tasted the same, little flavor, mostly just the sensation of something fried. I have been looking for a repeat of baby squid sauteed in hot oil and garlic that I had my first trip to Barcelona, so the waitress recommended the cuttlefish. Never again. But not her fault. Cuttlefish will remain on my list of dishes that resemble chewing a rubber band. Cerveceria Catalana is worth a visit if you're in the area, but there are many excellent restaurants and tapas bars in Barcelona."
4022,26-12-2013 ,2.0,"A Chinese inspired Catalan cuisine. Nothing special. I ordered the potatoes brava and the garlic sauce was too much. The wallpaper in my hotel room is peeling.I also ordered these mini burgers which came last, after one bite I took a look inside and they were not cooked, at all. I gave them back. When the billed came, I knew they were trying to pull a fast one, but once I made the notion to take the burgers off the bill, the manager proceeded without debate. Overall you feel like you are in an assembly line when you eat there. Their only goal os turnover. Within 30 seconds of leaving the table, it is already set for new patrons. "
4023,24-12-2013 ,4.0,Our friend recommended this to us so we tried it and we are glad we did! We had to wait 30 minutes or so for a table but it was worth it. The tapas were great. Seafood was fresh. Waiters were friendly. Would definitely go back. 
4024,23-12-2013 ,4.0,You have to stop by at the cerveceria Catalana. The concierge at the hotel where I was staying recommended it to me as one of the 2-3 best tapas places in Bcn. It was a great experience: the place was packed and the selection of tapas dizzying. I found a seat at the counter and started to order randomly some of the food that was in front of me in the window. I was a bit lost with all the options available and Looked at what my neighbors were eating to find ideas. Food came instantaneously and everything was delicious. I had 5 tapas but wish I could have tried many more. Will come back
4025,22-12-2013 ,5.0,"Very good service, impressivly fast. Great place for tapas ranging from 3.8€ to 9€. The beer is cheap. The quality of food is good but the mostr impressive pat is service. Cakes not ok."
4026,19-12-2013 ,5.0,My wife and I ate lunch here twice during our trip to Barcelona this past December and we loved it. Both times it was very crowded and many of them were locals. Always a good sign! The first time we ate at the bar. That was fun because you could just point at the different choices to order. The second time we ate outdoors.Inside or out the place is noisy but that is part of what makes it fun. This place will probably be our first stop on our next trip to Barcelona.
4027,19-12-2013 ,5.0,"I ate here 2 times during my stay in Barcelona, and it would have been more if it wasn't so backed all the time..that a wait can range from 30min -1:30...I found the food to be excellent, especially the seafood while some dishes were better then others everything was at least good while some items were exceptional...I especially enjoyed the octopus with black rice and the burgers were yummy.. and I was pleasantly surprised by the cost, felt it was great value for money..in my 5 days in Barcelona this was my favorite place."
4028,18-12-2013 ,5.0,"During my first visit to Barcelona I was in the company of several business associates who had been there previously. As the group huddled over where our first night's dinner was to be had, the Cerveceria Catalana was the only place anyone had heard of. It had been highly recommended by another associate not with us on this trip. I arrived earlier than the rest, so I promptly took my place at the bar and ordered Jamon, Padron peppers and the house Sangria. Amazing. The jamon was perfect, with just the right amount of fat to meat ratio. The peppers were fried to perfection, and salted just right. The half pitcher of Sangria was loaded with fresh fruit, and tasted like wine rather than fruit juice. One of life's great pleasures must be to sit at a bar in Spain with a plate of jamon and a good pitcher of Sangria. No question. As the other in the party arrived, we were promptly seated and began to order plate after plate. Everything was served quickly, and everything was amazing. I ended up eating at Cerveceria Catalana two more times during my week in Barcelona, and will eat there often if I have the pleasure of visiting Barcelona again."
4029,17-12-2013 ,5.0,"We had our last meal in barcelona there and it was the best one!Amazing tapas! Fresh sea food great meat!We ordered shrimps, fish and shrimp, steak tapas, calamari, and another type of steak tapas, small hotdog, payee which were all amazing and a cheese tapas and red pepper with fish which were medium.This place is a must! You can't stope eating!"
4030,15-12-2013 ,5.0,"I'd been recomended this place by my sister and it was well worth going. It was pretty hectic when we turned up at 9pm on a friday night, as you can't book. You have to put your name on a list and push your way to the bar to get drinks. However it was definitely worth the wait. We asked the waiter for recommendations and they were definitely spot on. The tomato bread with ham was exceptional, as was the egg, potatoes and tomato which was mixed up at your table for you. It shouldn't work but so does! Well worh trying this place. "
4031,14-12-2013 ,4.0,"Been in the restaurant twice already and always a pleasure.Worth the waiting in line, I recommend sitting on the bar."
4032,13-12-2013 ,5.0,"Delicious and delightful we had veal sirloin, prawns and cod fish. I would recommend these dishes. A must try for anyone visiting Barcelona "
4033,13-12-2013 ,5.0,"Great food good prices (80 Euro for 2, including 1 bottle of wine). Can't book but worth the queue. The seafood is super fresh. Nice ambience, good energy. If I had such a place at home I'd be there every week."
4034,13-12-2013 ,4.0,"Very good, fresh food, good atmosphere.we enjoyed it very much.good tapas and great service. recommended!"
4035,12-12-2013 ,5.0,Amazing! Excellent Snacks and beer (Stella Artois) with a beautiful place. Prices are good! A must see place in Barcelona!
4036,12-12-2013 ,5.0,"This was one of the first new style tapas places in Barcelona. It is still as good and as popular as ever despite having doubled in size. The staff is mainly foreign, filipino, and efficient ( despite a small error in our multi item bill).As in all tapas bars, it is worth looking at the food laid out in the bar and ordering from the list of recommended tapas. The food is of good quality and fresh tasting. I suppose that because of this and the good value for money, I often drop in for a light lunch when in town.There are sometimes more foreign customers than Spaniards now, (perhaps the fault of Tripadvisor!,) but the place is still popular with locals.I look forward to my next visit."
4037,10-12-2013 ,5.0,"After getting well and truly ripped of in Barcelona with over priced rubbish we came here on a reccommendation of someone who had lived in Barcelona and it is lovely. Good food, nice atmoshpere and thankfully reasonably priced. We went at lunchtime so got a seat easily but you will wait on an evening. As usual food comes out quickly served by professional staff. If we had been in that area on the evening we would have gone back"
4038,8-12-2013 ,5.0,After a year we decided to go there again. Nothing went wrong. Restaurant was again packed but it went fast to get a table. This years highlight for me was duck breast with foie and crema catalana. Will come back again.
4039,7-12-2013 ,4.0,This restaurant is just a block away from where are staying. Every time I pass by this place I feel like at least stopping for a cup of coffee it is so nice.We had breakfast couple of days and it is truly delicious and made the right way. The staff is quite pleasant and serve well.Though it is little expensive than others in surrounding but it is worth the spend.
4040,5-12-2013 ,4.0,I highly recommend having a meal here. The staff was very helpful. I suggest sitting at the counter/bar. You might get some specialty items that people ordering in the main restaurant don't have access to. This is a no brainer. Go eat here and enjoy. One word of advice... it was a very crowded spot so go with patience.
4041,1-12-2013 ,4.0,"Having discovered many other great places in Barcelona, I would recommend this only of you go outside the rush hours and don't queue for more than 15 mins for it (otherwise, just go somewhere else).The food remains spectacular, service is great, atmosphere is buzzing.9/10."
4042,30-11-2013 ,4.0,"We planned to have lunch here but only to find thay we were actually walking the opposite direction of Mallorca street, we ended up visiting La Sagrada Familia first. After a good exercise walking down from the Torre, we are more than ready for dinner.Tip1 : ask the security officer at the exits for direction - which happily pointed us to the right directionTip2 : make sure that u r on Mallorca street and the numbers on the shops are decreasing as you walk (i remember starting from 370) towards 236.Tip3 : Good walking shoes are a +, Took us about a good 25mins walk and we are there around 5pm on a saturday eveningTip4 : This place is pack!, call in for reservation or show them your best hungry face. Tip5 : try the seats at their tapas bar or proper table if you are on a diet - the tapas looks amazing and the staffs here are helpful and fast.Tip6 : its ok if you dont speak Catalan - we told the nice waiter that we like shrimps, ham & house pour Rose ... and they did not dissapoint.Tip7 : Sangria like drink served in a pitcher seems popular Overall : Worth the long walk and the que, we might just go back tomorrow... on a cab perhaps :p"
4043,28-11-2013 ,3.0,"This place is aesthetically pleasing to the eye but not to the pocket. The husband and I went there for a late night snack as we have just moved around the corner. It is definitely a place for tourists as 6 montaditos, two beers and two glasses of wine set us back 50€. We love the atmosphere of the place. It's not beautiful but relaxed (we were there at 10pm). As we live two minutes away I guess we would go back but hopefully our food will be locally priced as the Spanish often give regulars the normal prices and not what the tourist pay. "
4044,28-11-2013 ,5.0,"Highly recommend by my apartment owner as this is right below my rented apartment. ;)Nice and Friendly Servers who knows how to speak English, even some don't they still try. Must try their Tapas of the Day.. Been there twice in a week and tried most Tapas and Motaditos... Delicious!!! Bad of this place is You Need to Queue to get your seats... Minimum waiting time around 30min - 45min for non peak BUT it Worth Waiting!!!! Worth Waiting and Quality and Delicious Food! Great place for dinner and Chill. "
4045,27-11-2013 ,3.0,"Based on so many positive reviews, the boyfriend and I decided to try it out. The server spoke little English, and made little attempts in trying to explain the dishes to us. He wasn't very patient, in fact, he never came by after he took our orders until we asked for the bill.I don't think the food was horrible, but it certainly was not anything special or out of the ordinary. We had better tasting food for a lot less money at other restaurants. I do not think this is a ""must visit"" when in Barcelona, and we personally would not return.It is very busy, and mostly filled with tourists. So I'm surprised our server was so unfriendly."
4046,27-11-2013 ,5.0,"Went to Barcelona about a month ago and this place was recommended to us by more than one person. Have to say that it lived up to the hype; was one of the best meals we had on our Spain trip. Had the calamari (probably the best calamari I've had in my life), the iberico bocadillos, veal loin tapas and the fires with poached egg on top. Must get the fries with egg, unbelievable dish and very unique. Waited about 45 min for a table but well worth the wait. Make sure to get the calamari and fries with egg"
4047,26-11-2013 ,4.0,"We had heard good reports about this place and swung by optimistically after the barca football game on a Saturday evening hoping to get food. Not a chance, the wait list was longer than the football results table. We returned on Sunday about 3pm surely this place should be quiet sometime? Busy but efficiently handled the wait list and finally got a table. Result!! Tapas was great. Ordered a vast selection and with drinks the bill was less than £90 for 4 of us. Was excellent quality and had a lively atmosphere. My favourite tapas is still Barrafina in London but this comes in a close second. Wonderful."
4048,26-11-2013 ,5.0,Visited on a Tuesday night. Every time we went past it was very busy so we were lucky to get a table. Great authentic tapas and friendly service. The bravas were amazing and the chocolate brownie is a must!
4049,25-11-2013 ,5.0,"I overheard a few locals talking about this spot & I decided to swing give it a try- on my first attempt at 1015pm on a Tuesday, the long 45minute-1 hour wait kept me away. I made my second attempt for lunch around 230pm the following afternoon, and was able to snag a table. My server was fantastic- explained the dishes and some recos- I ordered several tapas- first I tried a veal medallion- that was fabulous! Second I ordered a half portion of Fideua Marinera- which was basically like a paella with noodles instead of rice- it was terrific. Finally I had to try their take on a croquette, and it was one of my faves. Everything that I ate was delicious- and everything that I saw made me wish I had room to eat more- plus the best part was that it was an amazing deal! I would definitely make sure to stop by here again!"
4050,25-11-2013 ,5.0,"Heard good comments about this place from American Exchange students & tripadvisor. Went on a Saturday night. Had to wait 1 1/2 hours, but we all felt it was worth every minute of it. Every dish we had was OUTSTANDING (and I'm pretty finicky). Very reasonably priced. All we could eat including dessert & wine for 3 persons was 55 Euros. BTE excellent desserts too."
4051,25-11-2013 ,5.0,"Found this restaurant on various websites and it lived up to our expectations after reading all of them. Food was great, lots of interesting choices....only problem was everything went by on waiters trays too fast to see what other people were eating but neighbouring tables were glad to offer opinions. Everything we had was delicious. Got there at 7 pm and it was already busy. Service was good, just the right pace. Would love to go here again."
4052,24-11-2013 ,5.0,"3rd time back here. Food is excellent, service is attentive and value for money is excellent. Highly recommended Tapas venue in Barcelona for VERY good reasons. Be back next time!"
4053,23-11-2013 ,5.0,"This was the very place we went to eat after getting to our hotel on the first day. When we got there the place was packed and people were waiting. You can have your name added on a waiting list or you can grab a seat at the bar when one becomes available. We found 2 free seats away from each other so asked a couple if they minded moving up a little bit and within 2 minutes of arriving we were sitting and looking at the menu. The food is fresh, delicious, cheap and served mega fast (always a big bonus in my book) . The draught beer (their home brew) a perfect accompaniment to the food. We ate so much and had a beer each and the whole bill came to 25 euro. "
4054,22-11-2013 ,4.0,Brilliant montaditos and a great selection of hot and cold tapas. Odd selection of beers with only one local beer to select. Always packed!
4055,22-11-2013 ,4.0,We went to this tapas restaurant the first time at 9pm and the place was fully booked and packed with many people. We decided to go back the next day at 7pm to avoid the crowds. We took the last outdoor table. It is important to go early if you do not want to wait for over an hour. We tried the mixed tapas and it was delicious and ingredients were fresh. We added 3 more tapas to share and they are all authentic and nicely prepared. I would go back to this place when we visit Barcelona next time since there are a few more tapas (ex: steak & foie gras) that I want to try.
4056,21-11-2013 ,4.0,"This spot is always packed, early and late. The variety of tapas is very good and by my standards, tasty as well. Over a 5 day visit, I had tapas 10 times, and these were the best. The location is good, close to excellent shopping. It may be easiest for visitors to hit this spot for a lunch break."
4057,21-11-2013 ,5.0,"I rate this restaurant “Excellent” based on the food for the price. We were first taken here by our local friends for whom the place is a favorite and went on our own a second night. The restaurant is large and very crowded; chances are that you will have to wait as they do not take reservations. Best to go unfashionably early. The diners were both locals (a good thing) and tourists.The tapas from a large list of possibilities that I enjoyed most were the langoustines, anchovies, a mouth-watering veal dish and a to-die-for dessert which was combined crème caramel, yellow cake and whiskey. I asked for a salada verde which was not on the menu and they accommodated our request. (This did not happen elsewhere.) All plates were very reasonably priced for the quality of food. While this is not haute cuisine, it is a very satisfying experience. Both nights we ordered sangria which I know is a tourist thing to do, but we both enjoyed it as they served it with lots of fruit. The service in such a large place was okay with little English spoken. The décor was pleasant and modern. This place has a big positive reputation which seems to be merited based on our experiences. Another piece of advice: if you can, do a little research of what exactly each of the various tapas are because there are some that may appeal more to the locals than to American tourists."
4058,21-11-2013 ,4.0,"Recommended by our hotel, we went on a Wednesday evening, and it was packed, which I took to be a good sign. We sat outside on the pavement, which wasn't a problem at all, apart from the fact that I'd forgotten that you can smoke outside, and our neighbours did. That, however, was the only problem. We ordered several rounds of beer & tapas - a variety of montados and other things - with the help of the waiter's recommendations, and they were fabulous. The langostinos were superb: fresh, sweet & juicy. The cured ham (I forget which one we had) was wonderfully sweet and aromatic. The whitebait portion was enormous. Service was quick and efficient. I'd go back there without hesitation, but I'd probably try and get a table inside."
4059,18-11-2013 ,4.0,"This is a very popular place! We were here on a sunday evening with lots of rain outside. Had to wait 30 min for a table, but no problem. Service is very quick and effecient. Don't expect waiters to explain anything as they're far too busy trying to organise your food, which arrives extremely quickly and is tasty. We would come back."
4060,16-11-2013 ,4.0,"Went there on a Friday night 9.30pm it was absolutely jam packed, you just couldn't move and people just were mostly locals. We managed to get seats at the bar and the waiters behind the bar were terrificIt was spoilt by being jammed in and constantly pushed and shoved, would go again but probably later at night"
4061,16-11-2013 ,3.0,"We came here after recommendations from our friends. The expectation was very high and therefore we were disappointed so much. The place is very large and the food verity is very big and promising. However, the service and the atmosphere is like in a railway station. The tables are very close one other so you hardly can have privacy. The staff is rushing you to order and is giving you the feeling to rush and finish your meal and leave. The food was very oily!!! And the taste was like it was prepared in mass production line. We had much better restaurant experience in Barcelona that with this one."
4062,15-11-2013 ,4.0,"-Food: 5/5. Very good tasting tapas; mixture of classic and with a gourmet twist. Recommend the fried artichoke and coconut pudding.-Service: 3/5. Servers are rushed and probably used to serving tourists; they get the job done though.-Ambiance: 4/5. Was full of locals and tourists alike coming in and out all afternoon; definitely lively. Fancy enough for a nice date. Lastly, there are lots of tables in the back that you don't need to stand around elbowing people for space."
4063,15-11-2013 ,2.0,"As I knew the place is very busy, I called them to make a reservation.. but they don't take it. The man told me there could be a waiting time of 15-30 minutes. So I went there about 20 minutes before I appointed with my friends, so I could put us on the waiting list. The girl who takes the reservations told me it would take 45 minutes.. well.. so I waited for my name to be called through the speaker. The waiters were not really smiley nor attentive, they were in a hurry all the time and because it's so crowdy you're pushed aside all the time. After more than a hour my name was finally called and we sat down. We wanted to choose the tapas at the bar but we could only order at the table so the waiter listed like everything they had and we chose some random things. We did not order any salads, since just the look said enough.. We ordered mainly montaditos which were indeed very good. :) The ones with beef and with shrimps are my favorites, but they cost about 3,90 each.. I also took a whisky-crema catalana-cake, which was not really my taste, but well, maybe someone else likes it. So, the food is good, but not that amazing that I would go back there. There are so many places in Barcelona with good or even better food.. and there you probably don't have to wait so long, and receive a more smiley, more attentive service."
4064,14-11-2013 ,5.0,"Super tapas, fish food excellent in a cool atmosphere. In the evening need to book is always packed by locals!!!Friendly staff in the heart of the city"
4065,13-11-2013 ,5.0,"We came here after recommendations from our friends and they gave us a list of ""To order"".The choices were all perfect and we had the following for a party of 4:-- Bacalao- Camebert- Huevos cabreads- solomillo- langosti- sepionas plancha- champinones- pimentos de padronOk do not worry, they do have english menu. To sum up, we had the shrimp, the veal, potatoes with egg, mushroom, peppers, cod, potatoes..then we also had white sangria...it was yummy...when you go in a group, you get to order a variety and just pinch and try the different tapas! I loved it! It was mainly hot tapas and the food was really really good! If you are in the area, you must visit this place! It was already crowded when we arrived at 3 ish!!!! But we were lucky to be seated in less than 1 minute...oh and do save some space for the dessert...the pumpkin cake is something not to be missed! Salut & Buen Provecho! -"
4066,13-11-2013 ,2.0,"We were looking forward to a great experience based on a friend who lives in Barcelona. We were in the neighborhood during the day, so stopped in for lunch. The good thing, no line as other commented, but the tapas we had were not exciting, nor was the help. We did enjoy the hot fried peppers though."
4067,13-11-2013 ,4.0,"Too crowded, we had to sit outside. Not a problem, because the weather was nice and there were heaters on the terrace. Good tapas, especially the escalivada with goat cheese! Yummie! Very friendly staff as well. Price was very much OK!"
4068,11-11-2013 ,5.0,"We was recommended this place from people who has lived in Barcelona for many years. They told us to be there early, so we didn´t have to vait more than 20 minutes. We asked the staff to serve us what they would recommend. The food was excellent the service was also excellent. And the price was also affordable. 5 persons with lots of different Tapas, Cava, white vine and red wine for 240 Euro. If you are going to one Tapas restaurant in Barcelona, this is it."
4069,9-11-2013 ,2.0,"This is a classic example of group think, of the herd mentality gone wrong. You will see people lined up for blocks to get a decent meal with bad service. You will wonder why. Has everyone lost their minds? Or is it like no one has the taste or backbone to stand up and say, ""What the heck!""I have no idea who our wait staff was. We were served, or more often not served, by various different inattentive individuals, who intermittently brought us bad sardines, good shrimp, good fried artichokes, bad clams, bland calamari.There is a very interesting crowd here, very well scrubbed and high end. The atmosphere is nice. But it is toothache of a restaurant, from the wait, to the bad service to the mediocre food."
4070,9-11-2013 ,3.0,"A friend from Barcelona recommended this place, and it was packed, but we must has ordered incorrectly. Some of our dishes, gambas with garlic and oil, razor clams, grilled asparagus and mushrooms came out really well. Others such as the calamari and anchovies, were prepared competently but were boring. The waiters took a long time to respond to requests, serval times forgetting or getting the wrong order. We fortunately arrived early since we had read the tripadvisor reviews (we came before 7), so at least there was no wait. However, I think we will head back to Cal Pep and eat there again instead of coming back. Cost was 60 euros for two people before tip"
4071,9-11-2013 ,5.0,"Catalana restaurant is one of the best tapas place that I met.Till 18:00 19:00 (~) this restaurant is look like all of restaurants in Barcelona, no queue, but from this time and further you need to wait for about an Hour and the fresh & quality tapas worth it! The staff is very efficient, kind and well-mannered. My advice is if you can come earlier do it."
4072,8-11-2013 ,5.0,"A friend of us who lives in madrid told us about the place . At first we waited for 5 minutes due to the ""rash hour"" but it was worth visiting restsurant. Nice atmosphere and good quality food. Especially seafood was fresh and tasty.that was the tapas bar i was looking for!!!!"
4073,8-11-2013 ,5.0,"The Catalana is and was everything we had hoped for in a tapas place.Firstly it is a very busy place (and rightly so after you've been). Once you manage to shoe horn yourself onto a bar seat, the evening is a mix of a variety of fresh quality tapas, humourus staff and a good mix of tourists and locals.Dear world - this is the way fast food should be. It will remain long in my memory as my favourite tapas place after 4 years of living in Spain."
4074,7-11-2013 ,5.0,"We stumbled in this popular restaurant 3 years ago while visiting Barcelona, and enjoyed it very much. Therefore this time when we had a port of call in Barcelona we decided to eat there again. We got there about 1:00 and was seated quickly. The fried artichoke was off season but we ordered the prawn, the fried cuttlefish, the potato, red pepper stuffed with cod purée, mushroom and asparagus, tomato bread. everything was delicious. We had 1/2 cantos of vino too. All together 35 euros. Definitely one of the best tapas restaurant we've eaten. By the time we were leaving there was a line waiting."
4075,6-11-2013 ,5.0,"A frined of my recommended me this restaurant. I was little bit sceptical when I first so the loooong tourist line outside. We were in line for about 45 mintues and it was worth it. Was lucky to get a table out side and spend a couple of hours eating one of my best tapas meal. I went for a second lunch there a couple of days later, still excellent food. I will go back next time I am in Barcelona"
4076,4-11-2013 ,5.0,"This spot was recommended to us by our concierge at our hotel. He warned us that it would be busy and the wait would be at least half an hour. Well, he was right but the experience was worth the wait.There were so many people and if you love ""people watching"" this atmosphere is for you. Now the food, so many tapas selections to choose from. We had five selections which two of us shared. They included cod stuffed in a roasted pepper, sardines on a tomato and olive spread on crispy bread, Spanish omelette, potato croquet, and a sliver of pork on a melted Brie on crispy bread. All great to the point we will be going tonight as I write this review. With a half bottle of Rioja and an espresso it was only €38 Euros. I wish I could have a meal like this on a Friday night for this price back homeSource out this place you won't be disappointed"
4077,3-11-2013 ,5.0,We were a party of 6 and waited 20 minutes for a seat on a bustling Sunday afternoon and would gladly do so again. The dining area was full of families sharing their Sunday meal together. There didn't appear to be another tourist in the place. We ordered about 20 dishes and each was delicious. The price seemed less than the tapas bars we visited in the El Gothica. We would definitely go back.
4078,2-11-2013 ,5.0,"Absolutely perfect. Great food and service, perfect atmosphere and all for a good price. A must to visit."
4079,2-11-2013 ,4.0,"waiter chose tapas selection for us and it was a very nice selection. quick service, very tasty food and wine, good price. quite noisy place, but that´s the way it is everywhere in spain :)"
4080,1-11-2013 ,5.0,"My wife and I stayed at the south tip of Las Ramblas when we arrive Barcelona. But this restaurant is located in north (Eixample) even it's highly recommended. We ended up trying to find it after visiting ""casa Mila"" in the same area. And it turned out to be THE BEST meal we had in Barcelona! We were lucky enough to be seated right in front of the bar (and the lovely boss is right there to help us!) --- that's the best seat you could wished for! As we don't speak in Spanish nor Catalan, we just pointed at the tapas/dishes we wanted to try, and he would instruct one of the chefs to do it, with a proudly smile. All the dishes are so lovely and delicious that we sat there for almost 2 hours, just kept trying one tapa after another until we couldn't take it anymore. We moved to a nearby hotel the next day so we could visit this great restaurant by walk! We actually took a 5 minutes walk to go there for our brunch everyday since, until the day we left Barcelona. I strongly recommend you to sit at the bar (left hand side where the chubby boss is usually standing in). The experience is impeccable! And go there before 11:30 so you don't have to wait in line for 30 minutes."
4081,31-10-2013 ,5.0,This is the quintessential tapas place . . ..raucous and festive and great food. You cant go wrong anywhere in Spain actually. We would come here again. There is seating outside as well as at tables inside or at bar.. . we sat at bar and enjoyed our food; it was really crowded and busy though so be ready to wait a while.It is one of the few places that will stay open through siesta time and on Sunday (a lot of good places are closed during certain hours and on sunday as well)
4082,31-10-2013 ,5.0,"This restaurant was suggested to us by the Hostel we stayed at. They told us we might have to wait, but said it would be worth it. We ended up going there 3 times during our stay in Barcelona! The tapas were lovely, and our waiter tried to ensure we got things we would like. We got the same waiter for the first two times and he remembered us and everything we had eaten. Although it was very busy, it was still really lovely and the vibe was great. You have to ignore the people standing out the front and walk in to put your name down. Most of the people are just waiting for their name to be called. We took a walk around the block which has some lovely shops to look at while we waited and the first two times our name was called as soon as we got back. The third time we went we waited a little longer out the front and had to explain to nearly everyone that came to just walk in and put their name down.Anyway - apart from the service which was great and friendly and I would recommend asking the waiter for recommendations because everything he recommended was fantastic! The food is great - and you can order quite a few things. We had about 4-6 tapas, one glass of wine, coffee and desert for around 45 Euro which was great value for what we got. We spent more in other places that were nowhere near as good! The biggest recommendation I have is to try the Lemon Cream cake... it was divine!! The Homemade cake was also very good... but that Lemon cake kept us going back - especially for my daughters birthday! (our third trip). This feels like a genuine restaurant and not just a tourist trap - do yourself a favour and don't miss it!!"
4083,31-10-2013 ,5.0,"I've been hearing about this place right from beginning of my arrival to Barcelona. And I am not surprised, the food was wonderful (even for a vegetarian).However we did have to wait about 40 min. to get a seat, but that was just a prove of the popularity of this place. It was a little bit stressful inside, because of all the people and employees constantly moving around our table. But we were still served quickly and the food was amazing."
4084,30-10-2013 ,4.0,"Went on recommendation from colleague. Saturday night at 9pm. Told table for four would be hour and 15 wait so we gave name and went elsewhere for a drink. Went back 50 minutes later and were seated immediately. Delicious tapas - had green peppers because of TripAdvisor review - gorgeous. Prawns, camembert, mini hamburgers all good! Good value for money too. Would go again."
4085,29-10-2013 ,5.0,"My wife is not very bold when it comes to trying new food. However, after talking with two other couples at the tapas bar, she tried some of the things that they said she would really like. She is ready to go back. Unfortunately, it is not right around the corner from where we live.If you go, it must be early. That is, by 7:30 or earlier, to have a chance to get a seat. We were on the list for a table, but happened to luck out and got a seat at the tapas bar. The picture at the start of this page is that of the tapas bar. When our name was called, we decided to stay at the bar.The staff was great, the food outstanding, and the people at the bar were a lot of fun. We happened to sit next to a couple who were on our flight to Philadelphia the next day, and they were on the corner of the bar next to a couple from Tampa by way of Cuba and France.Back to the food. It is on display (behind glass) right in front of you. All you need to do is ask, ""what is in this dish"" and all will be explained if you feel the need to know. We had things that we tried, and then asked. But, it was great! I did not find anything that I did not like. My wife only passed on one thing on a combination skewer. She just could not get passed eels. For her to have enjoyed this place this much was truly eye opening. She can not wait to go back.This place is great!"
4086,29-10-2013 ,5.0,"This is the best Tapas I have ever eaten! Seriously! My wife and I shared 7 different tapas and finished a 1/2 liter sangaria and a half bottle of white wine between. Of the veal we asked for a second portion.The atmosphere is great, mostly local people who know good food, and the queues for lunch and dinner are long! We came at 7pm and waited 10 minutes to be seated. Highly recommend the Creme Catalan as desert."
4087,28-10-2013 ,5.0,We were recommended this restaurant by staff at the The Mirror Hotel and they were spot on. Expect a half hour wait they said. Because there was four of us we lucked into a table straight away. Seafood dishes were high quality and we also tasted some pork tapas. Very attentive service in a busy place. Recommended.
4088,27-10-2013 ,5.0,We arrived there on Sunday but quite early at 12am before it is crowded. The food was very goof and also the service. It is a great place and I will get back there in my next visit
4089,27-10-2013 ,5.0,"My wife and I were been there around 6PM and got a table immediately. Great service, delicious Spanish food and reasonable price. Strongly recommend!"
4090,26-10-2013 ,5.0,We went to cerveceria catalana last week at lunch time and were shocked by the people waiting outside waiting to have have lunch. Unfortunately you cannot make a reservation in advance but it is so worth the wait! The food is amazing and the prices were pretty good as well (considering that we ate so many tapas that the waiter thought we were waiting for a 3rd person to arrive)! A must go place! Don't be put off by the crowd (unless they tell you to wait for more than one hour - that is too long)!
4091,24-10-2013 ,5.0,A large variety and lots of fresh food! It is interesting to sit at the counter so you can look at the food before you decide.
4092,24-10-2013 ,4.0,"My girlfriend and I have gone here several times over the past couple months and it's always a great time. The tapas are really good- Favorites of mine are the cabreaos eggs, asparagus with mushrooms (and I hate mushrooms), the fried hot green peppers (not sure what the ""hot"" adjective is intended to mean, but they are temperature hot, and not spicy), the iberic ham flautas, and the california salad. Our go-to time to go is usually 10:30... They end up telling us that it's a 45 min- 1 hour wait, and it is almost always less, though I can't speak to this being the case on Friday or Saturday nights... In any case, if you have to wait, it's not a big deal because the food comes out lightning fast. As far as ambience goes, it's almost always super crowded and loud. Some people might hate this, but I really like it for both dates and outings with friends. There's an aura of excitement :)Other helpful notes: The sangria is average, and the desserts in my experience have been pretty subpar given the price. But don't let this stop you because the tapas are great!"
4093,24-10-2013 ,4.0,"Nothing extraordinary, but a good place to eat tapas with family, on a table. And open at 12 h! A little bit expensive but good quality and choice. "
4094,24-10-2013 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalan was recommended by a friend who warned me about the crowds. Fortunately the restaurant was a few blocks from our hotel. The first evening we went by, the crowd was so large we passed. We went back for lunch the next day and arrived just before the crowd started (around 1:30 or 2:00) The service was great and the food was absolutely delicious. We enjoyed a terrific meal and when we left the place was once again packed. The restaurant was clean, but the bathroom was a mess 10/15/13. (Which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars)"
4095,23-10-2013 ,4.0,"We went on our first night in Barcelona and would definitely go again! Didn't realise most shops were closed on a Sunday we ended up in Passige de Grazia wIth nothing to do so we wanted to have an ""early"" dinner at 18.30. We walked up and down that street for ages finding only the touristy tapas restaurants alfresco. So we decided to go off the street and thank god we did. Since we arrived early we didn't have to wait long for a table and could admire the mouth watering food display at the bar near the entrance. When we left at 20.00 there was a queue outside! We love seafood also we ordered the razor clams (on specials menu in Spanish) they were divine with garlic and herbs. The veal tapas on flat bread was nice but 3euros for one small thing. The omelette and tomato bread were traditional. Finished with a Manchego Cheese Plate. We had half a bottle of Torres vino and that's just enough for the 2 of us. It was a great intro to tapas compare to other places around the area which could be overpriced."
4096,22-10-2013 ,5.0,"At Cerveceria Catalana you can get on the 'list' and wait and wait and wait for a table or you can squeeze in at the bar and start ordering. I went twice on my trip and both times I had a fantastic time at the bar ordering primarily from their tapas of the day specials menu. My experience was so good the first visit I didn't hesitate to return. Both times I had great conversations with other travelers at the bar from the US, Norway, and Japan. I am looking forward to returning to Barcelona and more-so the Catalana!"
4097,22-10-2013 ,5.0,"Sat at the bar at this crowded and bustling restaurant after waiting 45 minutes to get into this place. Bartender was rude and disinterested at first, but eventually came around and had some decent wine suggestions for us. We were on the waiting list for a table for two and were finally seated around 9:30 pm. The restaurant was lively!!! The food (tapas) was very tasty and the portions were ample. Wine was inexpensive (especially compared to restaurants in the US) Loved the patatas brava and the peppers! The bill for the two of us (with 3 glasses of wine each) was something like $50 euro. Wow! Great value, terrific food, hip place. "
4098,22-10-2013 ,4.0,"Fantastic late lunch of calamari, prawns, patatas bravas, padron peppers and believe it or not the best mini cheeseburgers! Great atmosphere, very busy, hard to get a table but we got lucky. Be patient, it's worth it."
4099,22-10-2013 ,5.0,"Yes you might have to wait up to half an hour for a table, but this is the one restautrant that if I am in Barcelona I have to go vist. The food is by far the best tapas I have ever had, atmosphere inside is great. I recomend this place to everyone I know who is going to barcelona!!! 5*"
4100,21-10-2013 ,4.0,"The problem with Tapas restaurants is the more you visit them the more you build up a range of 'favourites' which not all restaurants live up to - and that's the only criticism of this Barcelona hotspot, that some of our favourites were missing!But let's start with the positives, this is a very smart and popular restaurant with charming front of house staff and a good stock of tapas basics. Particularly excellent is the cured ham, which I could have eaten all night! Hot dishes include some to please the kids - mini hotdogs and mini burgers - although ours were more impressed by the ham and the prawn skewers. Garlic prawns weren't on the menu but they were offered - which added a 'favourite' tick to the box. And although the food came out promptly as expected we weren't rushed. All this in spite of the fact that we waited 45 minutes for a table. I heard the chief waiter tell one family to come at 7pm to avoid the wait.The vast majority of the clientele were tourists - which may be a reflection on the impact of Trip Advisor which places this as one of the best restaurants in the Eixample district.The food was reasonably priced and we'd definitely go back again. A safe bet for a good night out."
4101,21-10-2013 ,5.0,"This was my first time in Barcelona. I was not familiar with Tapas bars and the food/eating style. After leaving this place I think I was absolutely spoiled as this was the best food I have had in some time....yes better than USA Steakhouses. The food prep and flavors were incredible. The atmosphere was great in the restaurant...it was loud but I think it was all from our table. The beef, shrimp, squid, peppers, omelets, and potatoes. This place is a must to visit regardless of the wait you will have for a table."
4102,21-10-2013 ,4.0,"Classic Barcelona, or at least what I imagine it has looked like for decades. The wait was a bit long, but we ordered a jar of sangria to pass the time. The food was exemplary classic Catalan dishes, a perfect way to be introduced to Barcelona."
4103,21-10-2013 ,5.0,took an hour and a half to get a table. but was well worth it. Great atmosphere and very good location.
4104,20-10-2013 ,4.0,"this is a great Tapas bar with amazing seafood treats, it is very popular so try and get there early (around 9pm)."
4105,20-10-2013 ,5.0,"Fab atmosphere, long wait for a table is def worth it! Great food, good service, could spend hours in this place. Don't visit Barcelona without eating here."
4106,19-10-2013 ,4.0,"I have eaten here more than 30 times in the last years and always sitting at the bar. I love sitting at the bar watching trays with new tapas and montaditos being delivered from the kitchen. It is not cheap, but not expensive either. All the dishes I have tried have been excellent. Usully good service, but when the place is crowded you have to be patient for a few minutes to make a new order."
4107,18-10-2013 ,4.0,"Stumbled upon this restaurant one evening, wandering through the neighborhood my friends and I were staying in. There was a group of people waiting around outside for tables. I think it was about 9pm so early by Barcelona standards, I guess. We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table and then went to town ordering food and wine.Sample of what we ordered (and devoured): razor clams, pan con tomate, langostinos, octopus skewers, patatas bravas, bocadillo, and jamon. Note to all: if you're not into pork, find another spot! Great food and it was actually really quick. I think we were in and out within an hour and 15 minutes."
4108,18-10-2013 ,5.0,"You should expect to wait but don't let that put you off, sign your name up and help yourself to some sangria from the bar while waiting outside. Try to sit at the bar as you would be up close and personal to the selection of Tapas, always easier to visually choose rather than choose from the menu. the ambiance is really nice, very busy, food is delicious. worth a visit!"
4109,17-10-2013 ,5.0,This is one place you must to visit in Barcelona. Be ready to wait in line to be seated because always in full of people willing to wait patiently . It's worth
4110,17-10-2013 ,5.0,Had a great time here. Despite the big crowd and no reservations the hostess quickly found a table for 4. We had excellent wine and tapas. Fried peppers were awesome and my wife loved the pumpkin pastry dessert. Very good meal at a decent price. Would highly recommend. 
4111,16-10-2013 ,4.0,"Taxi dropped us in Plaça de Catalunya as requested and I clicked restaurants near me in TA. We shopped our way along a kilometer walk and signed ourselves in for a 60 minute wait. We got wine from, Juan, and enjoyed the sidewalk international atmosphere. (Note: 3 glasses of wonderful house red for €6.50 - wine in the USA is just flat over priced.)The tapas were wonderful. Just go with the many descriptions offered up by other TA reviewers. There is a reason why this restaurant has the wait. It's damn good. €133 for five people including three bottles of wine. I don't remember when I've eaten as well for so little money."
4112,16-10-2013 ,5.0,"well I must say.. first time arrived in Barcelona, we went here.. and it was awesome!! tried all the ""no pork"" dishes.. Try these one:1. Roasted small peppers (we ordered 2 portion first and added 2 more after we tried it)2. ""Cabreaos"" Eggs Style (yummy yummy yummy yummy)3. Fried Cuttlefish (taste so good in your mouth)4. Steak Tapas (the meat taste like heaven)I must say.. you won't regret going here although it's a little bit pricey.."
4113,16-10-2013 ,4.0,"When we lived in Barcelona we were only a 15 minute walk from Cervesaria Catalana, which I consider pure luck. It is one of my favourite little spots in Barcelona. Whether sitting at the tables outside, the bars just inside (my favourite spot) or one of the tables, you can't really go wrong. I love sitting at the bar so I can see the fresh seafood and choose from the selection (pescadito frito fresh from the ice pack!). Waiters dress in seafaring outfits (think little captains of a boat or something similar) and the service is always good. Good selection of food and drinks. It's just a great place to eat, drink and spend time with friends!"
4114,15-10-2013 ,5.0,"I'm an expat living in Barcelona, and after many, many forays into various establishments, I've realized that some places people go to because they are ""must do"" experiences in Barcelona, not because they are really good places to eat. This is NOT the case at Cerveceria Catalana. I came at 14:00, so it was PACKED. There is a line. Wait in it. put your name in at the hostess (located inside a bit) and get a table. I took a seat the bar. They understand here that time is money, so the service is AWESOME. Within seconds of sitting down, Juan, the guy behind the bar, had my drink order. As soon as that was in front of me, he was asking my food order. I told him that he knew better than I did, but that I liked seafood. What I got was more art than food, really, and it was amazing. Shrimps roasted on a skewer, laid on a toast point with light home made mayonnaise (that should not need explanation) and sea salt, and a rendition of bacalao that truly sent me for a loop. Based on a toasted baguette, then a layer of tomato puree, the massive lump of cod was cooked PERFECTLY, and capped with a layer of caramelized olive oil and honey. Unbelievable. Even writing this is painful. I'm going back tomorrow. I hope to God they still have it. After that it was toast with a MOUNTAIN of paté, upon which rested a date, a sauted onion, and a small piece of blue cheese. Awesome. But Juan was not done. A different version of the bacalao came, this time in a pastry shell with an incredible savory tomato sauce. Finally, a delicate cut of beef, as tender as chocolate cake, with caper and olive. Amazing. Summary- this place is a massive tourist destination for very good reason- it is amazing. Super nice service, incredible food, great drinks, and a beautiful setting. If you have only a couple of days in Barcelona, make this place a ""must do"". As a resident, I will be coming here at LEAST once a week. If I can commit to that, I might get through the entire menu in a year. I am up for the challenge!!!"
4115,15-10-2013 ,4.0,"This is the best Tapas place in Barcelona!As soon as you walk into this restaurant you feel the warm spanish ambience all around!The smell soon convinces you to actually wait in that long line!First come first serve is their concept, no reservations possible! On the spot reservations only!The service is fast yet very friendly and attentive, the food is great, many many different varieties, ranging from very very typical Tapas to something you have probably not tried before....and of course you can't forget your pitcher of Sangria!Good price,delicious food, great atmosphere! A must visit in Barcelona"
4116,15-10-2013 ,5.0,"I tried this place after arriving in Barcelona based on TA reviews. Great tapas and bar atmosphere. Warning, you must be polite, but nudge your way in to the tapas bar and pick away. The selections were very fresh the day we were there. Mostly standard tapas. If you want more dynamic fare, there are many more places to chose from, but quite a bit more expensive."
4117,14-10-2013 ,5.0,Recommended by the concierge in our hotel who said it was the best tapas restaurant in the area and one repeatedly praised by other guests. We had to wait about 20 minutes during which time we had a drink and an appetiser. We were then seated and the fun really began. After a somewhat hesitant attempt at ordering we eventually decided on what we wanted and it all came through in a steady stream. it was all fresh and beautifully prepared. The staff were tolerant and friendly and the 'business' of the place made it vibrant and exciting. The wine and sangria were both reasonably priced and of good quality. The chocolate fondant was to die for! This was our fist meal in Barcelona and had we had more time we would certainly have made a return visit. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.
4118,14-10-2013 ,4.0,"We were recommended to Cerveseria Catalana by some people we met at Brunch y Cake's communal table - a mix of Americans and other Europeans. What a great find! It's in Eixample near the Passeig de Gracia, near the Universitat metro stop. We had a great mix of tapas - tomato bread, pulpitas (baby octopus in butter and garlic) anchovies in vinegar, and a lovely piece of cod on a skewer. We had 2 splits of rosata wine with our lunch, and the service was great - attentive and helpful, but not obtrusive. They were happy to let us sit and chat as long as we needed (in the early part of the lunch hour - around 1:30pm), but the table next to us arrived, ordered, and left within 30-45m and seemed to enjoy themselves just as much. Definitely recommend for fresh and interesting tapas. We ate on the sidewalk, but walked inside to find the restrooms afterwards - it is HUGE on the inside, so the fact that there is generally a bit of a wait should let you know how great the food is."
4119,14-10-2013 ,5.0,"Now this is a really good place, the waiters are professional and friendly and the food is fantastic and not too expensive. Great atmosphere too. The only disturbing thing is that word has spread and you might need to queue for quite some time especially if you are a bigger company. But once you are seated, everything runs smoothly. So go there, pe prepared to queue, eat their tapas and drink their wine, you won't leave disappointed! Our waiter was really professional, even though there were people waiting for our table, he didn't drive us away but let us eat and drink without stress.Rule of thumb: the earlier you are there, the less crowdy it is.. There are seperate queues for sitting inside/outside."
4120,13-10-2013 ,5.0,"Very popular spot right off Rambla Catalunya. Worth the wait, good service, great selection of tapas, huge variety. Ten o'clock is early!"
4121,13-10-2013 ,5.0,"Catalana Cerveceria came recommended to us from a travel guide in our apartment and it was well worth the wait. All of the tapas we had were delicious, including the obligatory patatas bravas which (very generous in portion), and the baby octopus which we had grilled on our waitor's recommendation. We were also recommended huevos cabreaos (we're told translates to ""crazy eggs"") by an Israeli couple we met here, which was shredded and crispy fried patatas with romesco sauce and two fried eggs on top which the waiter smashes together at the table. Devine, a highlight. The sangria was also good as expected. Recommend reserving a table. "
4122,12-10-2013 ,5.0,"Can't recommend this restaurant enough. Absolutely brilliant. Service was great, prices very reasonable. The veal and the manchego cheese in particular are not to be missed. Tip is to get there early as you can not book a table, but can have a drink and wait. Worth waiting for an outside table. We got there about 6.30pm (had been told to get there early) and waited about 10-15 for a table. Great options for meat eaters and vegetarians."
4123,11-10-2013 ,4.0,"Me and my wife had there one of best dinners during ours 7 days in Barcelona. We enter restaurant after 22.00 and was super busy - total chaos tough. Waiter didn't tell us where we should stand in the line, everyone was running around. After 15 minutes we decided to leave, but than my wife saw an empty table outside where nobody wanted to sit (it was all wet from the rain) We've sited there, and waiter wiped out whole place. And that after all i was great choice! We had really good meal with amazing atmosphere! Waiters where super friendly, next to us were siting Spanish couple whose recommend us some dishes, and from other side we met a lovely German couple. We ordered several tapas: overeasy egg on potatoes (recommended by waiter, was something i haven't ate before, delicious), 2x prawns, 2x Camembert, anchois, a pitcher of sangria and we paid for everything with tip around 35eur. Be careful of your belongings, while siting outside !! a lot of weird guys pass the street, and the wallet steal is pretty common there!"
4124,10-10-2013 ,4.0,"The restaurant was recommended by our friends and we didin't know what to expect when we went there the first time. As warned, it was super busy there! My husband and i went there on a Friday night, people were lining out the door. When we went in, there were two ppl leaving at the bar side and we slipped right in (lucky us).Food were amazing there...Love the modern atmostphere.We like it so much, we had to go back the day after again."
4125,10-10-2013 ,5.0,Fabulous modern tapas restaurant very close to Passeig de Gracia. They have outside seating as well as by the bar and in the main restaurant. Excellent service and superb choice of freshly made food.Would definitely go back!
4126,9-10-2013 ,4.0,Went at 11am. Was full of locals who looked like they were (late) on the way to work Ham Omlette and Coffee was only €3.30 and tasted great. Recommended. 
4127,9-10-2013 ,5.0,Seriously... Delicious ... If your quaming over tapas at 1.45 euro as its too expensive try eating in Sydney ... This was a perfect start to our Spanish journey... May go back for dinner
4128,9-10-2013 ,5.0,"We visited this restaurant upon the recommendations of the concierge in the hotel where we were staying and WOW,! The food was absolutely delicious, the service prompt, the decor was modern, the place was spotless and prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and freshness of the food. The place is crowded and hectic but be patient. You won't be sorry you waited. It's well worth the wait. This one is well worth a 10!!!!"
4129,8-10-2013 ,3.0,"If it is possible to go elsewhere, I would do so. The food is average but overpriced, the service staff is rude and the atmosphere in the restaurant is hectic. There are better places to eat in Barcelona! I would not go back here again."
4130,8-10-2013 ,5.0,"As others have said. It is very busy and even though my husband and i visited on a Monday night we still had over an hour to wait but we were prepared for this. We dropped in left our name then went for a drink and when we came back we just chilled at the bar and soaked up the atmosphere which was electric! When we were seated outside the service was quick and friendly, the house red wine was to die for and very reasonable. We ordered a wide range of tapas and all were fabulous! Special mention to crayfish tostado and cod roe filled peppers! U can order of menu or just point and try new things and the waiters are also happy to make recommendations! It is our first day in Barcelona but we will be back with my family in few days and would definitely be back here! Fabulous food, drinks , service and ambience what more do u need?"
4131,7-10-2013 ,5.0,It exceeded our expectations. There was enough food for all the palates and the prices were very reasonable. Make sure to go there early for dinner as it can be quite a wait. I will certainly be back next time I'm in Barcelona and will recommend to all my friends.
4132,7-10-2013 ,4.0,Had to wait an hour to get a table but was rewarded with friendly service and tasty food. Huevos cabaneros are a can't miss. Dessert was very nice as well. Only reason for not giving five stars is the long wait. 
4133,5-10-2013 ,5.0,"Food is amazing. The wait is long, and if you sit outside you will catch cancer from the sheer amount of smoking that goes on around you. Yet, it is worth it."
4134,4-10-2013 ,3.0,"We went to this restaurant based on the Trip Advisor reviews. We knew there would be a wait, which there was (approximately an hour). The bar-area was packed so we waited outside on the sidewalk but were able to bring our drinks out there, which was quite fun with the people-watching. The menu is huge and everything we tried was good (after reading other reviews before going, I was expecting outstanding food so I probably went in with too high of expectations). The only negative thing I can say about my experience here was our primary server who was not at all friendly or helpful with the overwhelming menu (the other employees we encountered, however, were wonderful). If I was in the area again, I'm not sure I would return (with so many other restaurants around) but I also don't think you can go too wrong eating here either."
4135,4-10-2013 ,5.0,"This was our best tapas meal during our two weeks stay in Barcelona! A very popular spot with the locals, so plan on waiting if you go between 8-11pm. Though... IT IS WORTH IT! The seafood selection is the highlight of their menu. From razor clams to octopus to shrimp... everything they had was well prepared and delicious. The pork belly on a stick was a great balance because of the richness it brought to the meal. Overall, it was a lovely experience and would definitely recommend this place and will definitely visit again when back in town!"
4136,3-10-2013 ,4.0,"Very good food and very good presentation. The service was very fast, but we had to wait approximately 45 minutes for a table at lunch. Its possible to eat and drink during we wait for a table"
4137,2-10-2013 ,4.0,"Paella was overcooked. Menu del dia was quite dull.Mediocre quality and taste food. Flawlesly effective, kind and helpfull service!"
4138,1-10-2013 ,4.0,"We had to wait an hour for a table as you can't book but as we had been warned this wasn't a problem, we put our names down & went around the corner for a drink whilst we waited. Enormous choice of lovely dishes & just seeing what other people had inspired us! Lovely food & good value for money, my only criticism would be it's so busy you feel a bit rushed. Would go back however."
4139,30-09-2013 ,5.0,"went there twice, at about 20:30-21:00. the place is packed!!! they don't take reservations, you have to come and wait for your turn or get a place at the bar which we found even better because you always see more things you want:). if you want to try as many thing as you can (recommended) you can ask them to take half portions of the bigger ones (not tapas). everything was excellent. 2 people- with sangria, beer, 2 desserts- 50 euro. worth it!!!"
4140,30-09-2013 ,5.0,"Our hotel staff recommended this restaurant to us and we are so glad they did. Although the menu wasn't in English, we had no trouble ordering our tapas with a little help from the nice waitress. The food was wonderful. It will be crowded and there will be a wait, but it's worth it. And our wait wasn't nearly as long as they said it would be. We went back the next day for drinks while waiting for friends."
4141,28-09-2013 ,5.0,"It was the first time for us and the anticipation was killing us. We had tried twice before but never found a place where we could enjoy the pleasures we have been reading about. Finally tonight was the night (or should I say afternoon, as we had to show up at 615pm to find a table?) the experience was worth the wait and every tapas e tried was outstanding, the waitress made some very good recommendations and sangria kept the evening well lubed. A must!"
4142,27-09-2013 ,5.0,"Very busy joint recommended by a number of friends when visiting Barcelona. Comprehensive tapas menu and varied sangria selections. Attentive wait staff and fun atmosphere. We had a great time! Must try the goat cheese/almond logs, delicious!"
4143,27-09-2013 ,4.0,"Catalana came recommended by so many friends, that we just had to try it! I was told it was best to go at night (which is true!), we waited almost an hour to be seated, but it was worth it! The food was not the best but it was good. They have the best sangria I have had!Catalana is so packed at night and if you want to be seated outside, you have lines of people standing in front of your table waiting to be seated."
4144,26-09-2013 ,4.0,"We went without a reservation in the evening, and the place was very busy. We had to wait an hour for a table. Suggest you book if you have any time constraints. The food was great - good and varied menu, well prepared, the atmosphere in the bar was good. My only complaint is that it was so busy that the staff were very rushed and a little indifferent to the customers at times. It is more of an upmarket tapas bar. Interestingly we stopped at Ciudad Condal in Rambla de Catalunya the next day, and the menu was identical - another branch of a chain?"
4145,25-09-2013 ,5.0,"Another great recommendation from hotel, went for lunch, will do dinner next time, good prices also. Sometimes it can be too busy,so pick your times to go"
4146,25-09-2013 ,3.0,Great tapas and a huge choice but go early in the day to avoid the rush later. Service not the most friendly in Barcelona but Ok for a snack before seeing the sights. Good location for all the open top bus tours and airport transport.
4147,25-09-2013 ,5.0,"first is very recommended to reserve a table as the waiting list is quite long (we wait about an hour+).the place is very busy, the atmosphere is great and the service was bery good.we ask fromthe waiter to give us the most recommended Tapas based on sea food and meat.everythings looks and taste excellent the Sangeria ws also good.the price for such meal was quite fair.in overall for Tapas lovers this is a must place in barcelona"
4148,25-09-2013 ,5.0,"The best tapas we had all weekend. Good service. We let the waiter choose the tapas for us, and got very good food. And try the white sangria made of cava. Only minus, the hot chocolate cake we had for dessert was not very hot or good. "
4149,24-09-2013 ,4.0,We were recommended this tapas restaurant and it was great! Friendly staff who were prepared to explain the tapas of the day in English. The food was excellent in a very busy and obviously popular place. The prices were good and the Sangria fab!
4150,23-09-2013 ,3.0,"Twice visited here during recent visit. First time was great service, second time was below average; both times were equally busy. Across the board the food was very good. Easily accommodate groups and a good value. Be prepared to wait, first come seating at the bar."
4151,23-09-2013 ,3.0,"Food quality: good Seating: chaoticService: averageI think waiting for 90 minutes may not worth it, but otherwise the food quality is very good with Cerveseria catalana. Just that 90 minute queue... That's something I cannot forget easily. "
4152,23-09-2013 ,4.0,"We sat at the bar for a late night meal and drink and were well impressed. The place was electric with activity. We had several tapas with our wine, all were quite good and fairly priced. Nothing spectacular though. The bar environment was quite chatty and we got to talk to a number of locals which was fun."
4153,22-09-2013 ,3.0,"An ok atmosphere but surly service and overpriced, average tapas. Left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed."
4154,22-09-2013 ,3.0,"Not sure what all the hubbub is about. I went online looking at reviews for a restaurant whilst in Barcelona and this popped up. It was too crowded the first time we showed up so we went elsewhere. The next day we tried again and it was again very crowded, but we weren't as hungry so we waited. Simple food, price was good, service was decent, but not worth the wait or the hype. They sit strangers together to get people in faster. Do yourself a favor and go to Ciudad Condal just down the road a minute if you are willing to wait."
4155,21-09-2013 ,5.0,"I was a regular at the Cerveceria Catalana for in the past but this was my first visit to Barcelona for 8 years. It did not disappoint. The restaurant has been extended which helps with the queues but I would still advise to get there early by Barcelona standards (7 - 7.30) if you want to avoid a wait. Having said this - it is always worth waiting for - there is no-where else that serves this range of excellent tapas. - you name it they have it in tapas portion! Waiting staff were , as ever, friendly and helpful. I wouldn't go to Barcelona without a visit here!"
4156,21-09-2013 ,2.0,"I am not sure why it is such a popular opinion that this is the best tapas in the city; the pricing is good and it is authentic parish food, but the bread from the tapas was stale both times I went, and the service is a bit slow (but this may be because it is always so busy). There are several places to get better tapas for the same price in barcelona"
4157,20-09-2013 ,5.0,Really nice crowded place with nice service and the best tapas in the city. We were lucky to be with a local friend who suggested us as well the tapas to choose. The calamari were super tasteful!
4158,19-09-2013 ,4.0,"Friends who lived in Barcelona for some time have advised us to visit the The Cerveceria Catalana - and what a great advice it was! The Cerveceria was packed on both days we visited it, but both times we were lucky to get a place at the bar. The food was really good, some tapas were excellent (such as the one with melted goat cheese, the marinated beef or gambas), some were rather boring (salted peppers, fried potatoes with eggs), but all in all they were really good! Also the wines were good as well. Surprisingly the prices were quite reasonable for the quality offered. Especially compared to other Tapas places in Barcelona. We would definitely recommend the restaurant to our friends!"
4159,19-09-2013 ,5.0,The best tapas in Barcelona. The restaurant is crowded at the lunch and dinner hour. No reservations but fast turnover. The servers are great and the assortment of tapas is vast
4160,18-09-2013 ,4.0,"Went there with some girlfriends, the place is big and has also tables outside. It is usually quite busy around 3pm, so we went a bit later. The food was alright and was also reasonably priced. It was possible to try several smaller dishes of different kind, which was nice. Sangria with Cava was also good, no complains."
4161,18-09-2013 ,4.0,"Excellent tapas and sangria (even though it is a cerveceria). We thought the prices were pretty affordable. Try the potatoes (with garlic aioli & ketchup), grilled calamari, fried hot peppers, and Spanish frittata. The waiter was surly but service was efficient. Great people watching out on the street !!!"
4162,18-09-2013 ,4.0,This place came recommended by a coworker who raved about it. Went by hoping to get a table for dinner and there was a 1.5 hour wait! We decided to try another option but made an attempt again the next day for lunch. It was about a 20 minute wait but well worth it. We ordered sangria and tapas. Great options on the menu. Everything was delish and the service was also good considering the restaurant seemed at full capacity. Good choice of a restaurant if you can snag a table!
4163,17-09-2013 ,5.0,"Great prices, excellent food and wine. Make sure you ask for the bite sized tapas which you have to point to order - not on the menu. The house Rioja is very nice as well - by the glass or the bottle...."
4164,17-09-2013 ,4.0,"We really enjoyed the food and the fast service. We were a party of four and we were seated pretty quick. Much faster thatn a few parties of two. Maybe you should enjoy your meal with some new friends if there is a line. Any we took the waiters recommendations and we were very pleased with the prices, the quality of food and the service."
4165,17-09-2013 ,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! All the tapas were delicious! I love the pulpo (squid) and the bacalao the best! We were in Spain for 8 days and this was the best restaurant we've been to! We loved it so much and we went there twice! My daughter was already tired of tapas and was not too eager to go here. But when she tasted it on our first visit, she was excited to go back again. The wait was about 45 mins but it is worth the wait! Perhaps go there early before 7pm to beat the crowd. The waiters are excellent too! Don't miss this place when you are in Barcelona! "
4166,17-09-2013 ,4.0,"I went now for the 4th or 5th time to Cervezeria Catalana and I am still impressed with the hype that exists around this restaurant. The food is off course good, but there are many places in Barcelona that offer a similar qualitybat a lower price.We were a group of 6 and (as usual at this place) had to wait for an hour before we could get seated. Not so much of a problem for us as a group, but waiting that long if you re two or with the family seems a bit long ..."
4167,16-09-2013 ,4.0,"Very crowded, not possible to make reservations. Instead, queue up. But it is worth the waiting - The food is delicious!"
4168,16-09-2013 ,4.0,Long wait to get seated by a hostess that was a little on the snobby side but once seated we were served quickly by a lovely waiter and had some really great food. A lively spot. Highly recommended.
4169,15-09-2013 ,1.0,This is for tourist people Dont go there Food is horrible service is bad and price is expensive Forget about this place They are soo rude even to spanish standarts !!! 
4170,14-09-2013 ,4.0,People who travel to BCN cannot miss this fun place . The food is very good and service very friendly . One good tip : go far in advance to grab a table if you want to sit down because the place is always packed .
4171,13-09-2013 ,4.0,"Had a very nice meal there this week. The tapas, though not exceptional, were clearly above average. Service was good and efficient. The only problem is that it is so popular among both locals and tourists, that you get two problems: waiting for a table and being permanently aware of the other people waiting for your table. Altogether, it is worth checking out, but perhaps the popularity is slightly exaggerated."
4172,11-09-2013 ,4.0,We had a nice dinner there. It was pretty crowded but we managed to find a table right away (got luck!). The service was excellent and all the tapas we tried were very tasty.
4173,11-09-2013 ,5.0,"We went there because our friend totally recommended us to try this restaurant. We had our luck that there were not so many people. The service is good, the food is awesome. Totally recommended."
4174,10-09-2013 ,5.0,"We were told there would be a wait, so we went early and left our name with the ""booking supervisor"" on the footpath, who said to be back in an hour. We could have joined others at the bar waiting for their tables, but preferred to have a quiet chat so we had a drink nearby, and returned after the hour, waited 5min and were seated. There was a huge display of tapas on a shelf in the bar area all of which looked great. We ordered a range of dishes, and they arrived quickly, along with our drinks. The tapas here is seriously good, all four of us enjoyed every plate. The total price for drinks and tapas we thought really good value for the quality. Highly recommended."
4175,9-09-2013 ,5.0,"This place offers tapas of a very high quality. The tapas assortment is quite standard, but everything we had was very delicious. The chocolate cake dessert was extremely yummy.The place is very busy, so we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Later arriving guests mentioned 40 min waits. The waiters are busy but effective, so the food is delivered quickly, but the experience is not very personal.If you are looking for good tapas rather than a relaxing and cosy atmosphere, then this is a good place to go."
4176,6-09-2013 ,5.0,"My husband and I found this tapas bar on our first night and it was so good, we returned every night for the rest of our stay! Simply fabulous. Be prepared to wait to sit at the tapas bar, but it is well, well worth the wait. From your bar stool, you choose which tapas you want from the display cabinet and you can stay there for as long as you like. Tapas is fresh and varied. Superb. Try a half bottle of Anna Cordoniou with the tapas - delicious. Cost for a lovely tapas experience for 2 with drinks is around 25 Euros. Really worth a visit."
4177,6-09-2013 ,5.0,Best tapas we were able to find in Barcelona. Nice clean restaurant with great staff. Always managed to get a seat quickly. Stayed in Barcelona 5 days and went back twice for lunch. Well priced and excellent food quality.
4178,5-09-2013 ,3.0,"Our expectations were high - top recommendations on Tripadvisor, beatifull looking place and crowded. Well the food were just average, worst waitor ever. A reel disappoitment when you wait 1h and 15 min."
4179,4-09-2013 ,4.0,"There is a long line, so you have time to go aroud whilewaiting, but when you're there - the food, the service & the atmosphere are great! So enjoied it, that came back day after day :-)"
4180,4-09-2013 ,5.0,A friend of us recommended this Tapas Bar and it was 100% worth the visit. Besides the Tapas on the menue there are also daily special Tapas at the counter which you should not miss out. The guest were predominantely locals. We had about 15 different plates with four people and were charged roughly 30€ per person incl. drinks. Absolut worth to go there.Enjoy it.
4181,4-09-2013 ,5.0,"We were invited by one of our friends for Tapas at this restaurant. The place takes no reservations and one has to put the name on the list after arriving at the restaurant and wait for the table. Once you get the table, you would just need few minutes to realize, why this place is all crowded up. The first tapas arrive on table within 5mins of the order, amazing management. They had lot of options for veggie lovers and we just loved it, with crispy camembert and “pissed off“ eggs being the favs.And that is not all , you cannot resist the desserts.Will definetly go here again and again :)"
4182,3-09-2013 ,4.0,Lively tapas bar that fills quickly with a mixed crowd. Bar area is full of people waiting for their seats and reservations a must although we reserved a table and moved to a quieter bar nearby and luckily came back just as our name was called for our table. Good selection of dishes and good value for money for Barcelona
4183,3-09-2013 ,5.0,"popular tapas bar in Barcelona, so popular that you need to register your name with the hostess and hope you are able to dine in a reasonable amount of time, but at peak hours the wait could be a hour long. Yet you will definitely enjoy all it has to offer. Don't go back home without enjoying this place!"
4184,2-09-2013 ,5.0,"I had my lunch at cerveceria catalana, following the suggestion of a friend of mine. I will never stop thanking her! I went for lunch, it was already 3pm and the place was still packed with customers. I did not take a table to skip the (still) long queue. I recommend: - 'sepionas a la plancha'- 'navajas'The first one is a dish with 5-6 small grilled squids, really tender! and the second dish are the typical Spanish razor shells, also grilled, and really really delicious!!!! You can also taste many other delicious tapas, among them I mention 'pescadillo frito' - was missing that day! - and 'jamon' and 'pimentios'. I was too full to try the fig filled with creamy cheese and topped with ham, but it looked really appealing! I hope to taste it soon in the next visit of Barcelona! I had other tapas, tortilla, and one ""copa de cerveza"". I paid 32 EUR, a bit expensive but given the quality of the food, it was really valuable for the price!"
4185,2-09-2013 ,5.0,"Barcelona is the Mecca, ground zero, for tapas and this is it....the best place, that we experienced anyway, for tapas and to while away time with great food and drinks.It is busy...like really busy and especially at lunchtime 13.00-15.00 so be prepared to wait for a seat. You have mainly indoor seating with a few tables outside. There is a buzz and bustle about this restaurant and when you see the locals queueing then you know you will not be disappointed. Despite the packed restaurant our service was excellent and friendly. I don't know how the kitchen produces such good food under such pressure.You order two ways; off the menu at the table or/and you go to the bar point out the pinchos you would like and they are sent to your table. Magic. We had tapas and pinchos and each and every dish was perfect. I had one of the very best ever omelettes ( always a good test for a chef!) with a crusty outside and a slightly runny middle. Delicious seafood and local dishes. We downed about 5 (generous) tapas and about 8-10 pinchos...all different of course.We were so mesmerised by what was on offer we forgot what we ordered and dish after dish arrived to be devoured and we ended up absolutely stuffed. To heck with our diets which were doing really well until now! Yes....for sure we would go back, outside the busy times."
4186,31-08-2013 ,5.0,Everytime when i came to barcelona we go there ! I like very much cipirones but all the tapas are great !The only thing is that you wait too much for a table and rhey dont make reservations :( !
4187,30-08-2013 ,5.0,"Staying at Room Mate Emma and asked the front desk to recommend a place to eat. We assumed like other countries that they were sending us to someone they are friends/related to. Well, regardless if that was the case or not, we didn't mind one bit. We noticed a huge crowd outside and by the bar, but figured we would ask if there were any seats inside for my wife and 2 year old. We were sat immediately. The service over all was excellent as was the delivery of food once ordered. Prices were very reasonable as well. We had different tapas(Spanish omelet, Russian salad, German salad, mini hot dog, mini hamburger, veal, prawn); all tasting great. Afterwards we figured out why the place was so packed to begin with...definitely recommend stopping here."
4188,30-08-2013 ,4.0,"We really loved this place! They have really cool tapas and a good selection of beer. Also around the corner from passeig de gracia, a major shopping street. I would definitely go back!!!"
4189,30-08-2013 ,4.0,"To be fair, barcelona is swarmed with tourists so it can't be helped that you wuold be rubbing shoulders with them everywhere you go. However, if a more local ambiance is what you seek, like we do, I wouldn't come here. On the other hand, the tapas is nice and very affordable. My gf and I just didn't think the atmosphere was very appealing but we were hungry and the place did look inviting. Good cafe con leche! Location is great too!"
4190,30-08-2013 ,5.0,went there for early diner (or late lunch). the receptionist said we had to wait 30 minutes. came back after 20 and she rememberd our name! after anoter minute we got the table. the place is wonderful and match bigger than it looks from the street. the food tasted grate and the stuff was very kind and helpfull. the price is fair. excellent place for good othentic tapas.
4191,29-08-2013 ,5.0,"We arrived quite early for lunch (1pm ish) and nearly made a huge mistake by attempting to sit outside and order from the menue. One step inside, to view the mouthwatering selection of freshly-prepared tapas, and I just knew that the best place was to sit at the bar.The service is efficient but you can order what you want, when you want it and your tab keeps open until you have had enough. We were pleasantly suprised when the bill came - for 2 people it was 15 euro - and that included 4 beers.It will be on my 'must do' list next time I visit this wonderful city."
4192,29-08-2013 ,5.0,Fantastic decor with very experienced staff that ensured the cerveza's and tapa's dishes kept constantly flowing...Food is of highest quality and very well priced...Will certainly return when in Barcelona again
4193,28-08-2013 ,3.0,"the food is good, but not the best. It is worth going if the queue is not long.We waited for an hour to get a bar seat for dinner. i dont mind waiting for food though.veal sirloin: it is a bit tough. not as tender as it can be.prawn skewer: taste good crispy camembert: taste good smoked salmon: averagegrilled jamon + mushroom + asparagus: taste good grilled baby octopus : averagewe ordered 10 tapas, 3 glasses of wine, bill Euro 65. a bit pricey for its quality.Overall: good food, but not worth the wait.Will i return if there was no queue: may be if i'm in the area"
4194,28-08-2013 ,5.0,"only problem with this happening restaurant is finding a table. always packed although its a very big restaurant. if you are looking for a restaurant in the passia del gracia area, this is it. their tapas are fresh and way better that the tourisitc restaurants."
4195,27-08-2013 ,5.0,Each time we go to Barcelona it is a must for us to come back to this great restaurant that we know since 17 years. It is so fresh and nice. A very good advise is to come early (for lunch before 1 o clock for dinner before 8 if you want to avoid awaiting for one hour!!!!!
4196,27-08-2013 ,4.0,"Ate twice on recent trip... really good food, but could have had more variety. Staff great, good service, reasonable price."
4197,27-08-2013 ,5.0,"I am Spanish and I think this is the best TAPAS place in Barcelona. Do not miss it! WE love it everytime!. Quality, nice staff and good service; all this with amazing flavors and experience of Spanish TApas"
4198,26-08-2013 ,2.0,"Are they kidding? This place gets packed, seriously jammed full with queues of people waiting to get a seat. Our concierge recommended it and even a cab driver mentioned it as the best tapas in Barcelona. For me it was 'plain', nothing special and I didn't like the rudeness of the staff when I'm paying and I am never rude to a server so was upset to be treated like a blonk. You couldn't get a smile out of them. Don't know where to start on the food...Greek salad was diced tomatoes with tiny bits of red capsicum and gherkins. Feta cheese was more a buffalo mozzarella, enjoyable but expensive for nothing special. We could all do better ourselves. My partner got the small octopus, couldn't eat the head parts and was unappreciative of the quality. Mushrooms had soooo much oil on them there was more oil than mushroom. I found most dishes covered in way too much oil to the point I was dabbing everything on the napkin first. Hate doing that.Don't get dessert, all were disappointing.. They throw the 'hot' chocolate cake in the microwave (it's more a muffin) then squirt some supermarket chocolate sauce over it. The coconut cake was bland and this came with a squirt of cream in a can. Hate that stuff too. For the price, this should be fresh, I don't go to these establishments for McDonald's type food. Do yourself a favor, don't wait to be served up Maccas quality food and visit one of he MANY amazing places to eat that will appreciate your business and serve you better quality food. Still can't understand the hype..."
4199,26-08-2013 ,4.0,"Our family of four couldn't get a table at 7:30PM and a row of seats opened up in the bar, so we went for the bar. Service at the bar was efficient. We really don't know much about tapas, so we basically just order whatever that were in front of us at the bar. The variety is great. You can get veggie, meat and seafood dishes. We really like all our dishes. All are fantastically tasty traditional tapas dishes. The ambient is nice since there are just so many people waiting in line and the place is so busy. But remember, come early or try for the bar or wait on the queue for a long long time. This place is really busy."
4200,25-08-2013 ,5.0,"Great, well priced tapas and good wine. This place is popular, so you'll have to wait for a table, but what we did was give our name to the woman and then we got a drink in a different bar and came back 20 minutes later. It was well worth the wait! One of the best meals I've had in Barcelona!"
4201,25-08-2013 ,5.0,The place is popular. We arrived at 10:30 hoping they would still be open and they were on a two hour wait!!!! We squeezed in to the bar and enjoyed the night. People were spilling out onto the sidewalk with cocktails. Great people watching. Friendly servers. They had white and red sangria with a nice wine list too. The cold tapas are pre made and displayed at the bar so it makes it easy to see what you like. They have a huge tapas selection with lots of hot options too. This place was very lively and a fun place to experience. Make reservations far in advance if possible.
4202,24-08-2013 ,5.0,"It is a tapas heaven. The taste is simply amazing. At the end of each tapas we finished I felt seriously disappointed and I wanted to order the same again and again. The only problem is the waiter was not that friendly, maybe due to the crazy crowd he has to serve for! Btw try to go early, after 07:30 pm the queue is unbelievable and occupying the street in front of the restaurant. "
4203,24-08-2013 ,5.0,"The tapas bar is filled with excellent food, and the servers are friendly and helpful. Locals come here too, not just tourists. The servers seem to be able to help, regardless of what language you speak! Although you don't see bread, Pan y Tomato is a common Catalan dish. Bread with olive oil, rubbed with garlic and tomato. You can also get plain crusty bread if you like, but the tomato on the bread is typical in Spain. Anchovies plain and on tapas are common, my husband loves them! Half a liter of Sangria is very reasonable, and the best I had anywhere! We went here 2 evenings, and rebooked the same hotel from 3 years prior when we found this gem! It stayed true to our prior memories, it is a great place for tapas. Go before 730pm or you will not be able to get a seat at the tapas bar."
4204,24-08-2013 ,5.0,"Great food and very friendly, helpful staff. You may have to queue. We put our name down, went for a drink and came back 45 minutes later and our name was called out on the dot. Really fresh and tasty, will definitely go back."
4205,24-08-2013 ,5.0,"Located very close to the Passeig de Gracia, Cerveceria Catalana is the best Tapas in Barcelona. I was there twice when I visited Barcelona, and there is a line during the evenings. Overall it was a great restaurant."
4206,23-08-2013 ,5.0,"Arrived about 8pm - placed was packed. Was told it was a 45 minute wait, but stood behind some couples and was seated at the bar within 15 minutes. Waiter was excellent, gave his selection of favourites. The Rioja was an inspired choice - great wine. Highlights of the selection where bruschetta langoustine and the prawn skewers. The brought the food a little too quick so filled u quickly, less time to enjoy the ambience - but overall a great BCN experience."
4207,23-08-2013 ,5.0,A very popular restaurant that is worth the wait for a table! Tapas are very reasonably priced it is easy for 2 to eat dinner here with drinks for under €40. Service is good considering how busy it is and the front of house staff are lovely! This is not the place to go for a romantic meal or with large groups (you can't reserve tables so a wait on a large table could be a problem) but for great value fantastic tasting tapas it's def worth visiting. It's full of Spanish locals and tourists - our hotel recommended it to us and now I know why!!
4208,23-08-2013 ,5.0,"When we arrived at 10:30pm there were lots of mainly locals milling out the front drinking at the bar while waiting to be seated. Since you can't book we made a reservation for an hour and a half in person, the atmosphere was impressive considering the rest of the street was quiet. They honoured our booking to the minute, and it was well worth it. The restaurant was a hive of activity, supported by confident, competent staff who were very efficient at explaining the menu. The food was fantastic, we ordered several tapas which were great in their own right. The goats cheese with eggplant was particularly good, and I can also highly recommend the Creme Brûlée desert."
4209,22-08-2013 ,5.0,This was our first time to this amazing tapas restaurant. We had read the reviews and this place is fantastic. Great atmosphere and amazing food that is very fresh and well cooked.. Top tip is to arrive at 7 if you do not want to wait too long. You are not rushed once you are seated and guests seem happy to chat with you about the dishes they recommend or have ordered.Extremely good value for money.
4210,22-08-2013 ,5.0,"Our hotel receptionist recommended this place. Was very popular, when we arrived was lots of people waiting for a table, was about 1-1.5hr wait. We managed to get a seat at the bar where you can order tapas and have drinks. Bar staff provided excellent service. Food was great! Would recommend! "
4211,22-08-2013 ,5.0,"Great place for tapas! Not to miss!We arrived at 9, we had to cone back in 1hour to find a place,but it was worth it. Large variety of tapas and delicious sangrias."
4212,21-08-2013 ,4.0,"It is considered a tapas bar but the tapas there are nothing special. However, the seafood is absolutely amazing on fair prices. A bit of a problem is the long wait especially on the touristic season."
4213,21-08-2013 ,5.0,"After reading many reviews about this restaurant, we decided to brave it and try get a table.We arrived at 22h30 and were told that our table was going to take 1h15.We decided to stay.The place was packed,viby and the food looked it insane.Well, it was!This was hands down the best restaurant we ate at in Barcelona.It is truly remarkable how full the place gets and how consistent the food and service is.This place is a goldmine of note!The menu is great and the service is superb!We were literally eating within 15 minutes of sitting at our table.The prices are affordable and the selection is mouth watering.Writing this review, I feel depressed that I'm not eating there as we speak."
4214,21-08-2013 ,4.0,"We joined the crowd outside this popular place, once we got our name on the list we had a jug of sangria on the street to help pass the time during our hour to hour and a half wait! We eventually got a seat inside and ordered our tapas. They arrived promptly and were excellent.I'm sure there are plenty of other tapas places nearby where you wouldn't have to wait so long but we enjoyed people watching and the food was good so was worth it."
4215,20-08-2013 ,5.0,"This is a fantastic place to spend an evening either to eat or just enjoy a drink at the bar. Because this is a very popular venue, one, does sometimes have to wait a while to be seated especially on the outdoor terrace but let me tell you its well worth the wait. "
4216,20-08-2013 ,5.0,"We went here on the recommendatiion of our hotel, and weren't disappointed. We arrived at about 8pm and there was already a 1 hour wait list (you can't book), but we were lucky and some seats became available at the bar quite quickly, so we took those rather than wait for the table. The atmosphere was great, and the tapas superb - everything we tried was really good. Our waiter behind the bar was a little grumpy to say the least, but we still really enjoyed our evening, and this was definitely the best food we had during our stay in Barcelona. We also thought it was excellent value for money.Very highly recommended."
4217,19-08-2013 ,5.0,"Very good located in the center of Barcelona. You should wait a little bit for the table outside but is really worth it. There are so many good looking spanish tapas so we couldn't stop to order, just to try so many tapas possible. Totally recommended."
4218,18-08-2013 ,4.0,"Had to wait an hour for a table but it was worth it. Food was excellent and service was great. Not to be missed in Barcelona. Not all tapas are created equal, this place serves real quality stuff."
4219,17-08-2013 ,5.0,"A very confusing start to the meal in trying to get a table. You must speak to one waiter only who writes your name down and calls you when a table is ready. It is worth the wait. Food was excellent and really well priced. 10 tapas dishes, bottle of Sauvignon blanc and 2 desserts for 47euros. Amazing food"
4220,17-08-2013 ,4.0,"We went here because of all the great reviews we had read online and was a little disappointed. The location was very convenient for us and we had no problem getting a table for lunch (though when we walked by at night the place was packed!!!!) however the service was a little slow and compared to the tapas we had the day before at Paco Meralgo we thought the food was just OK. However, they did have great sangria that you could order by the pitcher or 1/2 pitcher which was a plus."
4221,17-08-2013 ,5.0,"Central location, classic decoration, place itself nothing special. Food, however, is top notch. Extensive menu, not only sowing the usual selection you get in most tapas bars, but going beyond with some interesting signature dishes. All ingredients are very fresh and food is perfectly executed. Take a look at the specials board or ask waiter to run you through them as, at least when I was there was only written in Catalan. Can get busy and crowded, so be prepared to wait, they do not take reservations. Well worth a reasonable wait though. If you are a couple or on your own ask for seating at the bar if main restaurant is too busy."
4222,16-08-2013 ,5.0,"Our first meal in Barcelona was at Cerveceria Catalana, and we were warned to get there early, or the wait could be long (no reservations accepted). We got there at 8pm to find the place packed! The 75 minute long wait was worth it, as the food is excellent! Even with the hectic pace, our server was friendly and recommended some of the most delicious tapas tasted during this trip - you must try the huevos cabreaos, mini hamburguesas, solomillo. My son and I returned for lunch the next day, just to get our tapas ""fix""! Try and sit by the bar, lots of choices, convivial atmosphere."
4223,15-08-2013 ,5.0,"From the food to the atmosphere to the service, we absolutely loved this place!Young, hip, trendy and definitely the place to be in Barcelona. If you show up hungry at 8pm, don't expect to be seated straight away. The wait is looooong but very well organized and oh so worth it.The staff is very kind and helps you pick the perfect tapas. Definitely a must go to place in BCN. Will go back again and again and recommend it 100%"
4224,14-08-2013 ,3.0,"The restaurant works efficiently in a production line like manner. First you check in and wait for your name to be shouted, then a waiter takes you to a table. For us he just threw the menus onto the table and rushed for another customers. Shortly another waiter takes your order and very soon the food is served. It's very efficient and optimized, but where's the individual service? The food is good and fresh, but not very spicy. I got more tasty Spanish omelette during breakfast at my hotel. "
4225,14-08-2013 ,5.0,We got there at 10pm and waited an hour to get a table. Completely worth it. Loved absolutely every bite of every Tapas we ordered.
4226,13-08-2013 ,5.0,"I'm not sure how, but my wife and I walked in at 8:30 on Wednesday night and got a table right away, despite the long lines of people waiting. As we walked to our table, we noticed that everyone has a pitcher of sangria at their table. So, that was an easy choice. It was by far the best sangria we had in Barcelona!Then came the first tapas - olives, calamari, croquetas, chorizo/ham sandwiches, and a few other delicious things I can't even remember. It was all amazing. After we re-upped our beverage with a half-bottle of house cava, we were still hungry for one more tapa. The waitress knew exactly what we were looking for. She came back with a giant plate of shoestring fries, smothered in garlic-tomato sauce and topped with two fried eggs. I can't even tell you what it was called, but it was AMAZING, not to mention a good way to soak up the alcohol!This place is an absolute must, especially if you've spent all day shopping in Passeig de Gracia. Worth every penny and then some - we still got out for just over ?50."
4227,13-08-2013 ,5.0,"First night in Barcelona for 2 families and we took the Concierge's tip as it was a Sunday and many places were closed. Get there early as there were notable queues when we left. Full of locals and a healthy number of tourists. Great, great Tapas served with a genuine friendly service, good English. A good number of square family tables for which suited us well. Kids choices and lots for the adults. A must dine in Barcelona in my view."
4228,13-08-2013 ,4.0,"this place was buzzing when we arrived in the late afternoon but this did not stop the service being attentive and quick. we had the sangria which was delicious, and tried a variety a dishes which were all absolutely delicious and flavoursome. it wasn't exactly cheap but the quality of the food and the freshness of the seafood was worth it, and the waiters were willing to offer suggestions of their favourite dishes which was very helpful. our favourite dishes were the potatoes and the croquettes. a must try for authentic spanish food!"
4229,12-08-2013 ,4.0,"The menu is very ""ecletic"", creative and delicious. The atmosphere and the way they attend you is different and you'll try all types of ""tapas and pintchos"". Depending on the day, there is a long line which isn't easy, but it's worth it."
4230,12-08-2013 ,3.0,"Nice place. Average food. Decent service. Clean. We ordered some tipical fried fish, and beer. A little overpriced. More fame than anithyng else"
4231,12-08-2013 ,4.0,"This place is huge. It's air conditioned and it looks like locals and tourists frequent here. The food is pretty good. We liked all of our tapas, and the price seemed fair. I wish we could have sat at the bar, b/c then we could have seen more of the food and might have made more inspired choices. Instead we were at a table at the back and just had menus. The yumminess of the food does not translate to the menus and so we made a swing through the dining room to spot what looked good. Service was okay. Kind of felt like we were on an assembly line, just get them in and get them out, but nothing was horrible or offensive. Worth a stop. Not the best we had, but by far better than most!"
4232,12-08-2013 ,4.0,"Real authentic tapas. This place was recommended by our very helpful apartment manager and it did not disappoint. We were 10 including 6 children. Ideally we would have sat at bar to get a good view of what was on offer, however a quick glance on the way to our table was enough to wet the appetite. The fig with cheese and fresh tuna with tomato both on skewers were the highlight. Would love to go back without the kids for a long lazy lunch."
4233,12-08-2013 ,5.0,"We eat here 2 times and each time was perfect. The food is excellent, and it is a must if you want to taste traditional tapas. The restaurant has a large variety of tapas and all are good. The price is also good for the quality of the food."
4234,12-08-2013 ,4.0,"Best tapas we had in Barcelona, variety of beers, really good prices!! However, you have to wait a lot..we waited around 1 hr and a half but i guess it depends from the time you go... We went around 9:30 and there was a really big line..unfortunately we didn't have the best service as the staff was very busy running from one table to the other so we never managed to get exactly what we wanted... Although we left a bit disappointed i would recommended it but i believe you should try to go earlier to avoid all the above!"
4235,12-08-2013 ,4.0,Amazing food ! you will miss out big time if you go to Barcelona and dont dine here.. It can get very busy but the waiting time is not longer than 10 minutes. I dream about going back to Barcelona only to dine at this place. !00% recommneded. You will not regret
4236,11-08-2013 ,5.0,"On one of the very fancy streets Mallorca, you cant miss Cerveceria Catalana Restaurant!Firstly it was suggested to us by Eulalia, a guide from Discover Walks. I and 2 of my friends visited that restaurant and Cherry (in brown suits) and Carlos ( man in black ) helped us about choosing our tapas...Staff is stunning! They are totally helpful about every detail, they also warn you about watching your bags or cameras out.It was our first time in tapas restaurant, and it deserved every single coin for meal and atmosphere and staff. Meat was perfectly cooked, not so dry or not so raw. and definetly we purchesed for wine (: yummy!Same day in the afternoon from our group a couple married in Barcelona, as a gift i took them to the same restaurant. And this married couple amazed with everything. (Just one thing to be honest they are not letting you to sit at such a big table for a long time, and that was ok for us... We should understand that is tapas! You should eat drink have some fun, but that is a restaurant, so they need new customers (:Next day in Barcelona... We couldnt stop ourselves... Sorry for th other restaurants but we have been there to taste the other kinds of tapas... and finally at the end of the trip definelty we had such beautiful friends there...Lovely Barcelona, unforgetable Mallorca and priceless Cerveceria Catalana... We will come back there again!"
4237,9-08-2013 ,4.0,"Undoubtedly one of the best places for Tapas in Barcelona. We were taken there by a relative who is a fervent Catalan and it turned out to be a great experience.This restaurant is best enjoyed in a large group. We were seven - a mixture of young and old - and everyone enjoyed it. Once you get the table (we waited about 15 minutes) the service is fast and cheerful. Even the noise is a kind of happy one, not jarring to the nerves. The variety of Tapas is incredible. As we were a large group, we ordered almost everything on the day's special menu and a lot of drinks.Although we consumed a large amount of Tapas in 30-40 minutes, we still ordered about seven or eight deserts and they were eaten up in no time. A happy and sweet ending to a wonderful Barcelona experience! Thank you Xavier - you really know your Barcelona,"
4238,9-08-2013 ,5.0,This place were recommend by our hotel staff and we really enjoy it. We should wait 20 minutes for a table but definitely worth it. So many tapas at reasonable price and good service. Totally recommended!
4239,8-08-2013 ,5.0,We had heard a lot of good things and they exceeded our expectations! Try the cuddlefish.... incredible!
4240,8-08-2013 ,4.0,"Great atmosphere, great tapas & sangria and surprisingly reasonably priced! Overwhelmingly populated by tourists, but it is August. Don't come if you only want local authentic/dive-y tapas, but come if you want great tapas paired with a place where everyone speaks English & they take credit cards."
4241,8-08-2013 ,5.0,"A native friend recommended this tapas restaurant and warned to get there early since they do not take reservations. We went at 7:30. By the time they called our name 20 minutes later, we were already elbow deep in sangria and amazingly delicious tapas at the bar. We had a ball talking to our fellow diners and interacting with the bartender/servers. You could see how fresh the tapas were as they quickly turned over and new platters were brought to the counter. There is an excellent selection of seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes. The razor clams and eggplant, red pepper and goat cheese terrine were our favorites. The turbot was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. We liked it so much, we went back the next day for an afternoon snack!"
4242,7-08-2013 ,4.0,"We came to this restaurant for brunch on a Sunday after trying to get in the night before, but being disappointed by a long wait time. We were so glad we came back. The food was delicious, the service was quick and professional, and it was nice to sit outside and take in the city on our last morning in Barcelona. I was sorry we didn't discover this spot earlier in our trip!"
4243,5-08-2013 ,4.0,Great food selection. Great wines.Pleasant and helpful staff.We ordered a bottle of cava and whiled away an hour or so munching on tasty tapas.Definitely worth a return visit. 
4244,4-08-2013 ,5.0,"Long story short. it's as good as everybody claims.High demand on getting tables, but worth the wait.Just relax outside with a cold beer and enjoy life, suddenly your table is ready :)"
4245,4-08-2013 ,5.0,"This tapas bar was brilliant, we went twice during our 3 day stay in Barcelona. The staff were very friendly and although we ordered in Spanish, were understanding of our need for an English menu.The service was super fast but relaxing and delicious! We were told we could even point out any dishes we liked the look of on display and they would do it. Definitely recommend this bar as the best we tried in Barcelona. "
4246,4-08-2013 ,4.0,"We were recommended this Tapas restaurant by a friend who used to live in Barcelona. You have to put your name down on a list either for inside or outside seating (or both!) and wait your turn. This isn't too obvious when you arrive so make sure you ask one of the waiters. You can grab a drink at the bar while you wait, but try and stay near the guy with the list!!We had to wait about 45mins for our table which we thought was OK. It food was superb and well worth the wait. The only criticism is that the staff do seem quite eager to rush you through, but just take your time and enjoy the moment!! "
4247,3-08-2013 ,5.0,"We stumbled in here, not knowing that there was hype about this place. We were just drawn to the busy energy of the place and the brightly lit tapas bar. My goodness. So delicious. The veal sirloin, prawn skewer, goat cheese escarole... I could go on and on. Fresh delicious. Not too pricey."
4248,2-08-2013 ,5.0,"After several days in Barcelona eating food that always seemed to come up short, my friend and I completely stumbled upon Cerveceria Catalan. We were slowly walking back to our apartment from La Pedrera and noticed a restaurant with a full crowd at the bar and outside. When we got to the door, two seats opened up at the bar and we parked ourselves in front of a beautiful bar full of colorful and mouthwatering tapas. And looks were not deceiving! Everything we ate was delicious! I would especially recommend the veal - I can still taste it - and a yummy dish with sliced zucchini, tomato and goat cheese. The sangria was also delightful. I can completely understand why this restaurant is on one of the Trip Advisor ""best"" lists. I am just so happy that we tripped over it!"
4249,2-08-2013 ,4.0,The atmosphere was fantastic. Hectic but at the same time so relaxing. just suck up the spanish culture.
4250,2-08-2013 ,5.0,"We were recommended to visit this bar by our hotel, but to be sure I check on Tripadvisor, it was also on the recommended list. We walked north after walking the La Rambla to find this place arriving about 1.30, got seats at the bar, within 30 minutes the place was crowded and people were queuing for seats, we had a good time and decided to return that evening, we had a long wait for a table, but well worth the wait, for us the best bar in Barcelona."
4251,31-07-2013 ,5.0,"After disembarking a 12 night cruise and getting used to once again finding restaurants in which to eat dinner, we passed this extremely busy place on Saturday afternoon at 2:30pm. We stepped in and saw beautiful tapas being prepared and displayed with stools set up, almost like a sushi bar. At this time of day, there was already a 1 hour wait. Back at our hotel (a 15 minute walk), we asked the concierge and they suggested we wait until Sunday night. We took his suggestion and went around 7:30 pm on Sunday and although already very busy, we had only a few minute wait. Not exactly knowing what to order, I went back up front to see what others were eating and what looked good. Our best choices were 1 Greek salad, chicken croquettes 2 each, calamari and some other items. The shrimp skewer was just ok, a steak item was good, but small. Don't bother ordering extra bread. Their own beer was reasonable. Dinner was around $35-40 US. We had so much fun, we went back the next night and also shared 1 Spanish omelet along with other tapas."
4252,31-07-2013 ,5.0,"Of the many tapas bars we could have visited, the reviews pointed us here and we weren't disappointed. We ate unusually early for us and Barcelona (6pm) so no queues. The cod filled pepper and the Spanish omelette were stars of the meal, along with the buzzy atmosphere. When we left (still early) there were already queues, but having eaten there we could see why. For a couple or a lone traveller the bar stools facing the food counters would be a great option, lots of wonderful good to admire and in the heart of the action. The bill was a pleasant surprise, 3 people, 5 plates, 2 deserts, 2 coffees plus drinks....around €50"
4253,31-07-2013 ,4.0,The staff here were very helpful to talk you through the specials menu (which was not in English) and were very prompt with the service. The food was delicious and I am still dreaming about the fried squid. The prices were very reasonable and we came back here twice during our stay. I would definitely recommend it.
4254,30-07-2013 ,5.0,"This is a small intimate restaurant with tons of tapas to choose from. Try the cod stuffed red peppers, OMG, so delicious we ordered a second order. The shrimp done several ways does not disappoint. We ordered a few of the tapas of the day as well as the ones on display. Ate outside on a beautiful evening, the service is excellent as is the wine. You gotta try this one!!"
4255,29-07-2013 ,5.0,"This place is more than a restaurant, it's an experience in its self. Don't be scared to queue for a table. Afterall when in Spain you can have dinner at any time. The food is splendid, the service is great even if it looks chaotic, they know what they are doing. We had dinner there 3 nights in a row. I would highly recommend this place"
4256,28-07-2013 ,4.0,"The food is delicious, staff very friendly and helpful, but... The organization is not so good, you have to wait for at least 45 minutes to get the chance to sit down. You can not book a table either."
4257,27-07-2013 ,4.0,"This is a very popular restaurant. We picked up a tip from a review on trip advisor to arrive before 7.30, which was a good idea since we were a party of 7. The service was good, although communication at times in english was difficult so we did not always receive the amount of food we thought we had ordered. However the food is simply delicious and huge variety. The was a good buzz in the restaurant and it was very enjoyable. I would definitely go back."
4258,27-07-2013 ,5.0,"Very good tapas & really nice atmosphere, a meeting point for Barcelona citizens and visitors. Crowded all the times but everybody looked happy! Tip: if you don't want to wait hours and hours try to reserve a table before your visit."
4259,26-07-2013 ,5.0,"This was by far the best food we ate in Barcelona. A big tip is to arrive before 7:30 to reduce the wait. We arrived as a party of 6 at 7:15 and only had to wait 10 mins. Order the authentic Spanish dishes and you will not be disappointed. For us the standout dishes were the manchego cheese, small fried fishes (sardines), pimientos de padron and chorizo. But every dish was excellent including olives, camabert, prawns and patatas bravas. The deserts were a little bit lacklustre. Service was excellent the first night and so-so the second night we went. In summary, arrive at 7:00, order Spanish dishes and skip desert."
4260,25-07-2013 ,1.0,"Food is not up to par, and frankly neither is the service. Calamari was soggy, shrimp weren't cleaned properly (intestine still in), patatas brava drenched in horrid white sauce. Never again."
4261,25-07-2013 ,5.0,We came a bit early so we were lucky to be seated right away. When we left there was a considerable number of people waiting. But even if we had had to wait it would have been worth it. I think this is the best tapasrestaurant in Barcelona and certainly among the best I have seen in Spain. The menu is very creative. Despite the cost it is easy to order way to much. The Tapas come in sizeable portions and we ended up not being able to ingest more than half what was ordered. Every bit however was delicious. In Barcelona there are so many amazing restaurants but this is the place to go more than a few times to experience that whole menu.
4262,25-07-2013 ,3.0,"Long wait as you might expect with the rating it has. Longer than 30 mins go somewhere else. Service was very good, pleasant atmosphere, easy to hold a conversation food was average. Have had better in Barcelona. Lacked flavour. Was looking forward to the stuffed flor de calabaza but not on the menu and what no meatballs. Risotto and chicken salad v good. Well priced, good value and good wines. Might go again but earlier, as entrance too crowded. Worth a visit. "
4263,25-07-2013 ,5.0,"We went there after a Barcelona game which was a stunning experience.we heard that it is one of the few options oped late night. when we arrived the place was full, everybody was feeling great, you could tell by there faces. They serve many kinds of beers and the menu is arrange by production country, very interesting."
4264,25-07-2013 ,5.0,Was lucky enough to have 1night in Barcelona at the end of our holiday and made our way back to visit this tapas bar after our last visit 3 years ago. The restaurant has had a make lover since but thankfully the food is still as good. Went around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty quiet so we sat up at the counter and enjoyed the service and food. Very enjoyable ...
4265,24-07-2013 ,4.0,"This was my 2nd time at this restaurant, with the first one being simply amazing. We arrived here early with some friends who had never been. The wait was about 45 minutes. We ended up getting a table outside which was unknowingly extra chaotic. They seemed to be pushy with taking an order and then some things never came, plus with people streaming around, waiting around it was like a circus a bit. I still find the food fantastic and worth going to, just get a table inside and expect it to be loud."
4266,24-07-2013 ,5.0,"There is no reservation but if you arrive around 7,there's not much of a wait. However long the wait, it's well worth your time. As you enter the restaurant on both sides are the tapas choices. While waiting take a look at all the choices. It might be easier to take photos of things you might be interested in ordering. If you aren't of Spanish speaking and know the name of the Tapas and how it's prepared, it can be very confusing! The waiters are not much help in explaining all items.I saw in the case flowers of the zucchini plant and knew this I wanted to order. And this was not on the menu. It was so wonderful that we order another round of them. The flower is fried and stuffed with a soft cheese and pine nuts.This was the best Tapas!"
4267,24-07-2013 ,5.0,"Amazing tapas, the best I have had in Spain! I do recommend going early, possibly 19:00 or earlier or else you will be waiting 30-45 minutes. They do have an English menu however some items are still hard to understand. If you are new to tapas I recommend their tapas platter I believe it was 15 euros and gave you 5 different tapas, very good!! It is not on the menu, but ask for the flower of zucchini, it is stuffed and fried and is a little piece of heaven. I ate here twice during my time in Barcelona and both times were excellent!"
4268,24-07-2013 ,4.0,"Totally lives up to the hype, and overall very tasty. Come early, or wait a long time.We ordered the assorted tapas (fried peppers, fried small fish, grilled clams, croquettes, grilled prawns), razor clams, pork flautas, potatoes bravas, boiled prawns and the house specialty, fries with runny egg.Look at the pics and drool away =) Super yummy. We ate here and at Ciudad Condal. I thought that the food here overall was better, but the fried seafood here was a bit greasy (the oil wasn't hot enough, since the oil soaked in). Flavorwise, I prefer the tapas here to Ciudad Condal but both are awesome. The service here was much much much better.TIP -- the grilled prawns are much tastier than the boiled prawns. Order grilled! Oh, and get an espresso. Super cheap and very tasty!!"
4269,23-07-2013 ,5.0,Best tapas in Barcelona!Outsmart the locals and catch it on an off time.. All the tapas were well portioned.. Well seasoned.. And just beautiful... Desert was a plus also!! Probably the best tapas I have ever eaten... And it won't break the bank!!! Highly recommend it!!
4270,21-07-2013 ,3.0,"Good Tapas. But very long queues. While restaurants are all about individual preferences, and I can see a lot of reviewers who have given this a 5 star rating, I personally did not think the place was quite worth the wait and went there only once. There are at least 2 other Tapas restaurants in Barcelona that I liked more including one we simply loved (you can see my other reviews for the name) and ended up going 3 times."
4271,19-07-2013 ,5.0,My wife and I ate here twice on a 4 day trip and enjoyed it both times. It is crowded for a reason - it's a great place to have terrific Tapas. The waiters were very helpful and explained the choices we had and made recommendations as to what to try. When we got back to the US we tried in vain to find something even remotely comparable and failed. Looking forward to our next trip to Barcelona to eat here again.
4272,19-07-2013 ,5.0,"Just to give you an idea of how busy and popular this place is, we went for dinner on a Sunday night around 7:20 PM and there was a 20 minute wait for a table. By the time we got our table, customers coming in were being told that the wait was about 45 minutes. We tried different tapas and they were all delicious. Desserts were also very good. Service was friendly and efficient throughout our meal. Finally, we found it was probably the best quality/price ratio we encountered during our stay in Barcelona. Nine tapas, four desserts, three drinks and one bottle of cava for a little over 60 euros, that's hard to beat! For a different experience, try this place. It's totally worth it!"
4273,19-07-2013 ,5.0,"We went there without making a reservation about 8 pm for dinner. It was terribly crowded and the waiters said we would wait minimum 45 minutes for a table. So we left there and got back the day after for lunch. Well, it was totally worth for coming back. The tapas were excellent, they were really the best that we tried in Barcelona. The service was very fast. The prices are very low, considering the quality of the tapas and the service. It is a must visit in Barcelona. But I recommend to go there to have a lunch rather than dinner, due to the crowd."
4274,18-07-2013 ,5.0,"Bustling restaurant, some outside eating space. There was a queue when we arrived but happily as there were 7 of us we were able to be seated straight away! Large restaurant, we were guided through and around to a large square table next to the window onto the street. Great! The waiter was very helpful, guided us though the menu and even told us when we had ordered enough! Always tricky when you don't know the size of the dishes. We ordered a varied mix of dishes - the mixed salads were delicious, tiny hamburgers, deep fried cheeses, everything came bit by bit when it was ready and we all tucked in! Clean plates all round! Great atmosphere, friendly waiters, great food. Just go."
4275,17-07-2013 ,5.0,"Many people says that this is the best tapas restaurant in the Barcelona. They are right. It is.They have so many good portions that you should know what to order. I always do so that I tell waitress to bring me until I say stop. Then tell them fish, meat or vegetables.This restaurant they can make food. You have to wait normally one hour to get the table. Give your name in the list and have a drink next restaurant. Then come back and enjoy.Very good food and good prices!! This restaurant is a must when you visit in Barcelona. Good for lunch and tapas."
4276,17-07-2013 ,4.0,"This is not a well kept secret! You'll probably have to wait for an outside table, but the tapas was superior to virtually any tapas we had in our two week stay. Try the clams Gallacian....they were my favorite."
4277,17-07-2013 ,5.0,"What a place!Cold mid February and there was a queue to get in. On entering finally, we were told there was a 45 min wait. So we came back in that time and were seated by staff. The place was full at 1530 in the afternoon and atmosphere was amazing. We ordered a mix of dishes (on recommendation) from the waitress. But the standout was the mini veal burger - it could have been pulled apart with your fingers it was so tender. We sat and enjoyed the hustle and bustle and of course, the food and red wine! A trip to Barcalona must include this restaurant, it is Spanish tapas and life all in one eatery! "
4278,16-07-2013 ,5.0,"It was so busy, and I was by myself, so I wasn't sure that I'd be welcome. Well, what a surprise -- I felt like I was greeted like an old friend, and given a comfy place at the bar. The people sitting around me were all friendly, so had some chats with them. It was not problem ordering what I wanted -- just point -- and everything was quite fresh and delicious. Didn't feel rushed either -- felt welcome to stay as long as I liked. The wine and food were great -- was much more reasonable than I expected. Ordering without knowing the prices was a little uncomfortable for me, but it was less than half what I'd been expecting. Order the house wine -- perfectly lovely."
4279,15-07-2013 ,5.0,Our favorite restaurant in Barcelona - we have been here 3 times. Tapas are delicious!!! Best tapas which we tried in Barcelona. Staff is very nice and friendly. Just one minus - there is no reservation accepted so you have to wait long queue. It takes from 30min to 1h30min to get a table in the evening. Restaurant is quite big and can accomodate a lot of people
4280,15-07-2013 ,5.0,"Food was everything we could ask for - authenticity, taste, quantity and inexpensive!! Always full and no rsvp, but it's worth the wait!"
4281,15-07-2013 ,5.0,"Take note of the other reviews, they say everything needed!Great tapas, great atmosphere and always busy.This restaurant was busy even on quiet days when other restaurants were empty.Be aware though that you cannot book a table in advance; you turn up and wait for a table. They then normally tell you how long the wait will be. Worth the wait though. Decent portion size for the money charged and cheaper than many of the surrounding tourist restaurants.Try it and enjoy it."
4282,14-07-2013 ,5.0,"We found this by chance after browsing trip adviser for somerhing local to where we were. The place is buzzing: and we had to wait about 20 mins for a table. it was packed with locals and tourists alike, and worth the wait. The Tapas was great and very reasonably priced. I have saved the location as if i returned to Barcelona i would definitely pay another visit."
4283,13-07-2013 ,4.0,"This place is clearly popular with both locals and tourists. We arrived around 8pm on a Wednesday and waited about 45 minutes for a table. My 11 year old son (very picky eater) complained about the fishy smell from the counters at the front where we had to wait for our table. In fact he only ate a couple bites of the various tapas we ordered. We ordered a delicious gazpacho, prawn skewers, tortilla espanola, fried calamari, mini-hamburger, croquettes, bread with tomato, and also a wonderful bottle of wine. The staff were friendly, although is was a bit confusing who was our server because we had 3 different people coming to the table taking our orders during the night. Overall the food was good, but a bit expensive. If your child likes tapas, I think this is a family friendly option. Our picky eater didn't do well with this menu."
4284,13-07-2013 ,5.0,"We were a group of fifteen, with kids. Great food, service and moderately priced. Arrive early if no reservations (5:30). Gers packed with locals at night"
4285,12-07-2013 ,5.0,"We asked the concierge at our hotel if he'd ever heard of this tapas bar. He said no one in Barcelona hasn't heard of it. That's both the good and the bad of this spot. The tapas are delicious, but if you go at 8:00 pm on, it's packed. We went very early, which didn't bother us since we don't like eating later every night as the Spanish do. It was a nice change to eat at 6:45-7:00. The service is good, and the tapas are as good as it gets. There's a good reason it's so busy. It seems to be popular both with locals and with tourists."
4286,12-07-2013 ,4.0,"So I live in Jaen, Andalucia, and I went to Barcelona to visit with some friends. My local bank teller is from Barcelona so I asked her about places to eat and she recommended this place. And what a place! We loved it! Even though we had to wait like 40 minutes it was worth it. We ate amazing tapas, raciones and desserts. Even though it was full the service was great and there were a lot of locals. After all the meals we ate in Barcelona this was definitely our favourite hands down. I will go next time I visit this wonderful city!"
4287,12-07-2013 ,5.0,"Waited about 1 and a half hours for a table. Food came very quickly, was cheaper than most other tapas places of a similar quality and was really very good.Our waitress was quite fairly perfunctory about the whole affair but given our hunger we weren't really looking for being fussed over. Also, since the place is ridiculously busy, the waiting staff's time is at a premium so if you are after a very intimate dinner, this is maybe not the place. Otherwise, it's definitely worth a visit."
4288,12-07-2013 ,5.0,"We came here at lunchtime and saw lots of people milling around outside, waiting for tables. As there were six of us in our party, we expected our wait to be long. Our predictions were incorrect, and we were immediately seated, as most of the tables were set for 2s and 4s, and there were big tables open in the back. We walked past tables that had gorgeous food on them and couldn't wait to try everything we saw. Our waiter helped us order a sampler plate that had pimientos de padrón, sardines, clams, and shrimp. The kids ordered fried calamari, which they devoured. One of our favorite dishes had a fried egg on top of fried matchstick potatoes--the server mixed the egg in with the potatoes and we were rewarded with a delicious treat! The youngest in our group wasn't feeling adventurous and only wanted a bacon and cheese sandwich. She, too, was rewarded with a mouth-watering delight!"
4289,11-07-2013 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant as it was recommended by the hotel we were staying at, the first thing we noticed was that it was the only establishment that was (a) full of locals and (b) the only restaurant that was full and had a waiting line from early in the evening. There was a good reason for both if these, excellant range of beers available and the tapas was both extensive, delicious and reasonably priced. We ate a range of food served promptly, effectively and graciously by a very knowlegable waiter who advised on a selection of tapas. If I return to barcelona I will certainly be returning to this place and cannot recommend it highly enough. "
4290,11-07-2013 ,5.0,"We were told that there was a hour wait, but were sat down as we needed to get to a club. The food was amazing. This was the best selection of food. the tastes were amazing. Def would reccomend this resturant hands down. Would always visit this establishment when were in Barca."
4291,10-07-2013 ,4.0,"We were recommended this place by a friend who used to live in Barcelona. We got there just before 9pm and were told we would have a 45-60 minute wait for the table. We were actually seated in 25-30 mins. The tapas is nice, not amazing but still nice. The atmosphere is great and its reasonably priced, we had 5 tapas dishes between two (a good amount and my husband eats a lot!), two glasses of wine and a pudding to share for €39. "
4292,10-07-2013 ,4.0,"Although the place was crowded and we had to wait some time before the waiter arrived to take our order, it was well worth it. It helped that we had locals at our table. Sangria was excellent, fruity and very tasty (sometimes sangria can be watery and taste-free -- not this one). For tapas, we had pimientos stuffed with tuna, thin fries with eggs and red picante sauce (my favorite), calamari, croquettes, ensaladilla, among others. All fresh and delicious."
4293,10-07-2013 ,4.0,We had a recommendation so had to try it... Although we went quite early (7.30) the place was already packed but we were greeted warmly and seated in good time. The food was great and really reasonably priced. Would definitely go back! 
4294,10-07-2013 ,4.0,"First visited Cerveceria Catalan about eight years. It was my first encounter with tapas. Went there again last month for lunch. Welcomed with open arms by the manager when got through the entrance and led to a table just nicely located across the tapas bar. English menu was provided and the Filipina who waited on us was polite and quick. As for food, all the items which we ordered were skillfully prepared. Particularly impressed by the pan fried sea prawns. They were fried to perfect timing so that they were still tender and tasty. What was even more surprising was that you could still savour their freshness through the taste of sea water that they still retained in their meat! Deep fried small squids were devoured by us in an instance. Grilled cuttlefish was also tender mad fresh. Grilled razor clams were excellent and cooked to perfection - the meat was slightly chewy but still tender. One more point. The Sangria recommended by the waitress was also well liked by my party. It has a strong and refreshing taste of fresh fruits which was especially good for a hot afternoon. The other good point about the wine that it was quite smooth and mild, unlike those rough spirit which restaurants tended to use for inexpensive cocktails like this. Desserts were also nicely prepared. We loved the cream brulee Catalana best. Smooth and sweet egg custard with strong vanilla flavour. On the whole, I would say the service had definitely improved since my last visit - when patrons had to wait behind the back of eating guests to get a table. Food was quickly prepared and delivered to the table. But they did not rush you afterwards. Food quality had at least been maintained if not even better. One more thing, in term of price, it was no more expensive than the much touted about cooked food stall inside the fresh food market along Ramblas. It also easily outscored the cooked food stall in terms of comfort (you have to sit on tall stools with no air-con in the market) and quality of food (we all agreed that the food at the market was too salty). But, of course, you can try them both and make your own judgement afterwards."
4295,9-07-2013 ,5.0,"You need to wait to get a table but it's just outstanding. The prawn skewers are incredible, the waiters are very available and they always give good advice."
4296,9-07-2013 ,5.0,"We were recommended this place and really enjoyed our meal there ... we had some of best tapas we ate in Barcelona! We loved it so much, that we returned for our last night. Be prepared for a wait in the evening though. Great value."
4297,9-07-2013 ,4.0,"We walked to the Cerveseria Catalana after visiting the Casa Batlo` (c/Mallorca crosses Passeig de Gracia where the Casa is situated) and we remained quite satisfied. There was a large variety of tapas and of desserts as well. Although the cerveseria is a popullar place to eat, we didn't have to wait for a table. Prices were reasonable but portions weren't very big (patatas bravas). Maria, the woman who was arranging the tables wasn't very helpful, but I guess too many customers could make someone negligent"
4298,9-07-2013 ,5.0,"We stopped in for late lunch on recommendations of a friend. Every dish the 4 of us ordered was exceptional except for one. Staff was terrific, friendly, helpful. Ordered drinks that came in 15 seconds. Wait staff advised us to keep valuables safe while in Barcelona. Another staff warned us not to put the camera on the table or someone could walk by and steal it. Sat outside by the street which is a little noisy. Fantastic food. Will definitely come back again. Affordable."
4299,7-07-2013 ,4.0,"some of the tapas were terrific, some were just blah, like the overcooked octopus. this place is super crowded and we waited about 45 min for a table on a weekend, not sure I would wait that long again to eat here. tapas were not so much better than others we tried (like tapas 24 at lunch)"
4300,6-07-2013 ,5.0,"Unlike other places located along Rambla boulevard this one is reasonably priced Excellent tapas served with a good selection of wines and beers Nice friendly atmosphere, good serviceThis place is quite popular, so in the evenings there migt be more than an hour of wating to get a table"
4301,5-07-2013 ,5.0,"Upon recommendation of our hotel, we ate here for dinner. We then ate there 2 more times. The food is amazing. The prices are also unbelievably cheap. I would definitely go back! "
4302,4-07-2013 ,4.0,"I satdown in the bar so I did not wait for the service. But the guy who suppose to serve had the worst attitude. Made very rude remarks, I am a customer and it was my first time here. It has wonderful food but they need to change those people."
4303,4-07-2013 ,5.0,"If you haven't visit here, you cannot say that you have tasted tapas. For example, patatas bravas is the best of all barcelona. Staff is kindly. Place is very nice. Tapas are delicious. Only thing that you should know is, you have to wait for the table at least half an hour, if you go there after 20:00"
4304,3-07-2013 ,4.0,"After being told so many times by friends to try this place we finally did! We found a table straight away outside, no one was waiting and the place wasn't packed at all. My first impression of the waiter was that he wasn't in a very good mood but throughout the meal he became over friendly (good but strange). Both drinks and food were very tasty and definitely worth the value we paid (which was quite cheap to be honest). One thing I didn't like was the location - it is located on a busy road so the scenery isn't that amazing plus the Cerveceria looks average, the decor, furniture just don't match the place and the good reviews."
4305,3-07-2013 ,4.0,"This was my third trip to Cerveceria Catalana. It is always, always busy, no matter what time of day or night you go, but the queueing system is efficient and it's worth the wait. The fact that its very popular with locals as well as tourists speaks volumes. We went around 2pm on a Monday and had a 20min wait for a table. No problem. Once seated, our orders were taken efficiently, and drinks brought immediately. The great thing with the tapas is to order a few dishes, then order a few more if you are that way inclined, and we were. Pimentos de Padron, Iberica Ham, Catalan Sausage, potatoes in spicy tomato sauce, to name but a few that we sampled, all washed down by Estrella Damm. We weren't rushed at all, despite the busyness. The service is swift and efficient, without being over friendly, and it's a great place to people watch. There are also 2 bars at the front to sit and graze at, but we wanted the comfort of a table. Ill he back next year. Hopefully."
4306,2-07-2013 ,4.0,Good selection of tapas and drinks. Went here on our first night in Barcelona as it was recommended by the hotel concierge as his favourite eating hot spot. We ordered 6 tapas between 2 and it was more than enough. Seems like the place is always busy and very popular among the locals and tourists alike.
4307,2-07-2013 ,5.0,"We were so impressed with the food at the Cerveceria Catalina that we did something we have never done before, we went for lunch and dinner. We couldn't wait to get back and it was all we talked about the rest of our afternoon.We were surprised at the reasonable pricing on the menu. Our tapas were superb! We tried as many different things on the menu as we could and all were amazing and served at the perfect temperature. The only draw back is the wait. We would have loved to sit outside or at the bar where they highlight all of their food on the menu but it was impossible to get seating there."
4308,1-07-2013 ,5.0,"Great food, excellent server, wonderful location on the sidewalk on a beautiful June day. Come eat here but there may be lines."
4309,1-07-2013 ,3.0,"Nice place, typical spanish tapas. Very crowded after 1pm for lunch and 8pm for dinner.Good choices of tapas, better the ham and meat ones to the seafruits"
4310,30-06-2013 ,5.0,"The tapas were great. The choices were plenty. Prices were inexpensive. The place was busy, hectic, and energizing. But the waiting could be long especially for a bigger dining party.My wife and I deliberately went early at 6pm and chose the counter instead to avoid the long line-up. We met some friendly diners sitting next to us and enjoyed the camaraderie spirits. We had a good time and totally enjoyed the variety of foods and the good atmosphere. We liked it so much that we went back the next evening for an encore.Do try their montaditos or little open sandwiches with all kinds of different toppings for as little as 1.40 Euros each. The veal sandwich costed slightly more and was very tender. Local beers were 2.35 Euros each. At the seafood counter one could choose from variety of squids, clams, anchovy, and skewers. My bottle of Enate cabernet sauvignon was 14.35 Euros. I enjoyed the fried Camembert cheese on a stick for 2.95 Euros.We left Barcelona with fond memories of Cerveceria Catalana, and will come back some day soon."
4311,30-06-2013 ,3.0,"The best tapa was the grilled veal, it was incredible. But other than that, the other tapas seemed pretty standard and similar to what we had at other Tapas bars in Barcelona. The location is very convenienent for those staying in Eixample. The interior is nice and we had a great table on the sidewalk with a nice little fence seperating us from the traffic. I recommend this place, but there are so many other great tapas bars in Barcelona that this one didn't stand head and shoulders above the others."
4312,29-06-2013 ,4.0,"Yes, tapas are great, the choice is broad and the service, once you're finally seated (!), is quick and professional! No matter what you get, the tapas are all good: my favourites are the grilled octopus and the calamari! Ask for the list of the tapas of day! What i really hate is the waiting: you cannot book so you have to show up there and check in... Then the waiting starts and on weekends can, litteraly, take hours! Unbearable! So, is it really worth the waiting?"
4313,27-06-2013 ,4.0,Service is a little brusque in this extremely popular spot but the food was of a very good standard. Bookings are not possible so either go early or be prepared to put your name on the wait-list. 
4314,26-06-2013 ,5.0,"When you pass through the place, can easily realize is a place to eat we had to wait 30 minutes to sit as it was too crowded. The food was nice and at very reasonable price for the food you get. Haven't visited many tapas restaurants in Barcelona, but so far its the best."
4315,26-06-2013 ,5.0,"This place is amazing, if there is one restaurant to go this is it, this place was recommended to my friends and I by two different people, do not be put off by how busy this place is, the service is quick and friendly, 6 of us turned up at 10:30pm without a booking, we were told the wait would be 45 mins which we were happy with, there is a lovely bar to have a drink at and you can watch all the tapas whizzing by, we then got our table after 20 mins. The food is amazing and the best I have eaten in Spain, every dish was delicious! we thought the bill was going to be more than previous restaurants, we had wine, 2 jugs of sangria, loads of food and it worked out 20 euro each we could, such great value for money, I think this place would be great for lunch if there are a couple of you as you can sit at the tapas bar and pick your food."
4316,25-06-2013 ,5.0,"We have been recommended this place from our B&B and eventually, despite several tentatives to get a table in the evening, we managed to have lunch here on our last day in Barcelona (just 20m waiting compared to the evening 1h 30m).The service is fast and food is very good although I did not really get the Spanish feeling as it's more a trendy tapas place (especially in the evening) than an ""old style"" one - definitely worth a visit. Portions are quite reasonable so do not order too much in the beginning as you'll be always able to order more and get it quickly later"
4317,25-06-2013 ,5.0,"My husband and I decided to try this place out after looking at reviews on Trip Advisor. It ended up being only 3 blocks from where we were staying. We arrived around 8 and there was about a 30 minute wait, but we were able to find a seat at the bar and order a drink. We could have ordered food, but chose to wait until a table, but the bars have the tapas right there and you can order either while you're sitting or choose to eat the entire meal at the bar. Our name was called quickly and we got a quaint table and ended up ordering the grilled pork loin, Mallorca sausage with cheese, croquettas, manchego plate, a prawn and mushroom skewer, calamari, octopus, pan con tomato, a bottle of of the house wine, and a hot chocolate cake. The food came quickly, fresh, and was absolutely delicious. The service was pretty good. Both my husband and I having been fine dining servers in the US, the service out there is different than here and all the servers are going to your table to clear the plates or give you another menu and it's not like you're connecting with just one person. But it was nothing to complain about, just a different experience. We did not feel rushed, even though the food came quick and we ended up wanting to order more tapas than our original order because they were so good. Overall, including the two beers we had while waiting, our entire bill was 50 euros, which is very affordable for a higher, fresher, better quality taste than you could ever find on Las Ramblas. I definitely recommend trying it out."
4318,25-06-2013 ,5.0,"There was a very long queue when we arrived as expected. We put our name down and waited in the bustling bar at the front with a glass of Spanish wine and a couple of cold tapas in hand - although it's a squeeze to get in to the bar to order! There's an English menu and the waiter was extremely helpful, suggesting delicious choices we may not otherwise have made. The Rioja wine was cheap at €12 a bottle but really good. The food was simply amazing and cannot be accurately described in words. All I can say is have the warm Camembert, the foie gras and the prawn skewer... And you won't be disappointed. At €51 for a bottle of wine, 8 tapas and a large shared cheese plate, food of this quality and in such a bustling, lively environment is cheap. Highly recommended. "
4319,24-06-2013 ,5.0,Both time we visited this place we were highly impressed with the quality of food. It is super crowded if you go around dinner time (which for Spaniards is around 930 pm). The smoked Salmon and the Cod with honey are delicious!!
4320,23-06-2013 ,5.0,"Barcelona has a thousand good restaurants to choose from. In Cerveceria Catalana you will see many local people eating there and for a good reason: plenty of different options to choose from, at a reasonable price and if you seat at the high chairs in the entrance you will have all the tapas in front of you just waiting to be served on your plate.Be there early or you will have to wait.Ordering the Jabugo is a must! with the pantomato of course. The pimientos padrón are very nice.Having breakfast at the tables outside is very pleasant. You can ask the Huevos Cabreaos (eggs+potatos+smoked ham)."
4321,23-06-2013 ,4.0,I went to this cerveceria with my family and two friends in our holidays in Barcelona. It was very nice. The food is fantastic. A place to came back.
4322,23-06-2013 ,5.0,"We came here following the recommendation of some good friends who had lived in Barcelona for 10 plus years and they told us this was the best place for tapas. I can understand if you are unfamiliar with spanish food and not too adventurous, then this is not the place to go. This is more for the traveler that enjoys different tastes and wants to eat what the locals eat. The place gets packed and there is a waiting list to seat you. Our wait was 30 minutes, but we had beers at the bar and people watched, so the time went by fast. The tourist arrive for lunch around 12:30 to 2pm and the locals get there after 2pm. The waiters translate the menu and they offer daily specials, which I highly recommend. The plates are good to share and be careful not to over order. Enjoy!"
4323,23-06-2013 ,5.0,"It's crowded. It's noisy. But the food is superb, done exactly how it should be. No standouts to mention...everything is great. I've been four or five times and everyone who's been there on my recommendation has absolutely loved it. Really well done."
4324,20-06-2013 ,4.0,"This is a great Catalan tapas resturant. There are a lot of people and unfortunately, you can not reserve a table. You get to sit at the bar and drink one or two pitchers of sangria while waiting on the table. At first it feels like a real tourist trap, but the later you get there the more genuine and Catalan becomes.The tapas are wonderful and there are lots to choose from, we were pleased with the food and the service. It's crowded and hot, but it is the same on all tapas restaurants in Barcelona. Cerveceria Catalana is well worth a visit."
4325,19-06-2013 ,2.0,"We had our first meal here in Spain, and I would like to say we are kind of disappointed in this place. We had high expectations of Spanish food before we went there, but what we had there are only just cold dishes of Tapas and terrible service. The atmosphere is good but the price is not reasonable for the food and service. Actually, we found some other restaurants which serve better and cheaper food than this one in the following days of our trip in Barcelona. I think this restaurant is for tourist rather than local people."
4326,18-06-2013 ,2.0,"We went to this restaurant based on the TA reviews. All I can say about this place is just OKAY. Very average Spanish food. We were unlucky to get this waiter who seems to be very careless, kind of spoiled our mood. The food was just nothing special and we later had the same tapas elsewhere, which had way better taste and at a lower price. Maybe we were just not so lucky, since we saw the table next to us got a nice and friendly waitress who apparently cares about the costumers more than our waiter does. But it doesn't worth going all the way to search for this restaurant, any bistros or tapas place on the street side can be better or at least serve equal quality food with nicer service. I do not recommend."
4327,17-06-2013 ,5.0,"Even though it is very crowded, the food still come pretty quickly; and delicious. We were there twice, and prices are reasonable."
4328,17-06-2013 ,3.0,"Okay the food here is great but the wait is terrible, hence the average rating....It is good to know what it has a sister restaurant called Ciudad Condal. See my TA link for the food review between these two places: http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1059712-r163825947-Ciudad_Condal-Barcelona_Catalonia.htmlOnly other tip I can point out is to watch out for bar seats. Do fight for those seats as hunger can drive you crazy at such fine establishment."
4329,16-06-2013 ,1.0,"We just live a bad experience with the bill. We receive a bill for 2 persons of 64€. Was ok, except that they charge us for the soured cream added on the ice cream (9,8€) , 2€ more. The concept was not soured cream but ""tapas del dia"" or tapas of the day. We said that we are not ok to pay this but the waiter said that we have to pay what he notes. No way, we discuss, come another one with the same argument and finally we pay. But really take care, the waiter charge the supplement they want with concept which are not in the menu."
4330,16-06-2013 ,5.0,"We ate here twice for dinner. We were staying at the Hotel Regente so a very short walk! We particularly enjoyed the hot tapas - veal sirloin, chicken and ham croquettes, mini burgers. The crema catalana (Spanish creme brulee) was too large to finish, but very tasty!"
4331,14-06-2013 ,4.0,"A very busy restaurant although for lunch. Variety of food for choosing, worth to try! I am sure u will enjoy the atmosphere and the service. There is a bar that u can sit beside to look at the attractive seafood and order ore easily."
4332,13-06-2013 ,5.0,"This place is sooo unbelievably delicious and good value we went back for round two the next day for lunch. We sat at the bar the first night and it was fantastic, it all the action and we saw all the plates come out so we were able to choose not only what sounded great on the menu but what looked delicious too! The next day we sat in the restaurant part and that was good but we preferred the bar.The whole place buzzed with such a fun vibe, I have a feeling we will go back many more times to come!"
4333,13-06-2013 ,5.0,"Very efficient service. They are very fast. The food is very good although the ""bravas"" were a little bit raw. The rest was perfect. Lovely tapas!"
4334,11-06-2013 ,5.0,We first visited here 14 years ago and thoroughly enjoyed the tapas. We went back the next day the food was so good. Imagine our delight when we went back to find it years later now twice the size and remodeled two years ago but still serving outstanding tapas. At prime time in the evening it may be hard to find a table. Go there for lunch when seating is far more accessible but the food every bit as good.. For the real tapas experience in Barcelona this place is hard to beat and well located a block and a half off Passeig de Gracia on Calle Majorca.
4335,10-06-2013 ,2.0,"Based on the stellar Trip Advisor reviews, as well as a glowing recommendation from a friend who had recently visited Barcelona, we looked forward to Ceveceria Catalana as a potential high-point of our trip. Unfortunately, it was a dud. The place was bustling with diners around lunch time on a weekday afternoon, but we were able to snag a table inside with no problem. The service once seated, however, was slow, inattentive, and unwelcoming (even by Barcelona standards). The food wasn't much better. We ordered a bottle of cava, and a mix of largely disappointing items off of the standard menu (we avoided the daily specials, as that menu was only in Spanish) . We ordered an assortment of six montaditos, only half of which were particularly enjoyable (though forgettable at best). The patatas bravas were shockingly poor, slathered with a wholly unnecessary amount alioli, which was only accentuated by the bland, marinara-tasting red sauce and the soggy texture of the not-at-all-crispy potatoes. Our lunch was partly redeemed, however, by a well-balanced plate of superbly-cooked veal loin with jalapeno, as well as a fairly decent crema catalana, though neither was good enough to offset the earlier disappointments. Hopefully we just caught them on a bad day."
4336,9-06-2013 ,5.0,Ate there a couple of times.Best tapas we ever had!More fish then meat tapas but for a no fish eater like me it was still perfect.Come early to be sure for a table.
4337,8-06-2013 ,4.0,"Do not let the hefty line up of tourists fool you. This place is worth the wait. It is definitely organized chaos, but once you pass the line up, the food and service fully deliver. Great, reasonably priced tapas. Food quality is great - this is basic, delicious tapas, nothing too outrageous or inventive. Seafood was fresh and the sirloin was fantastic. Service is efficient and friendly. Fun place to grab a quick lunch and a drink!"
4338,8-06-2013 ,4.0,"My first impressions of the Cerverceria Catalana were not good as my host & I struggled to catch anyones attention to get a table and order a beer as we waited to be seated. The place seemed to be teeming with hopeful diners, many of whom were tourists and prepared for a long wait. Somehow, however, the chaos at the front of the place seemed normal and everyone was good humoured. The real fun started when we were finally seated. This really is a great place for tapas and we pushed the boat out with all the typical favourites which did not disappoint. Can't remember what local deep red wine we ordered but it was recommended by the house and was delicious. Here you don't need to be a wine expert - just let the guys give you a recommendation. Having a local host was a clear bonus as he joked and negotiated with the friendly waiters about the best tapas available that day. In fact what I love is going to a place where you don't really need to read the menu - just rely on the staff to bring you the best without any fear of being ripped off.We finally, reluctantly gave up our precious seats to the next lucky diners having experienced a truly wonderful, traditional tapas evening. What I liked was the whole informality of the place whilst having the satisfaction that you have chosen something really very special."
4339,7-06-2013 ,5.0,Was there on recommendation of a friend...and got not disappointed. Is it crowded and chaotic? Yes! Do you need to wait for a while? Certainly. Is it worth the trouble? For sure!!!Arrived there at around 7pm and got told that we (2 persons) can get a table in 45-60min. Around the area you'll find some street cafes so we just sat down there and had a couple of drinks before proceeding to the dinner. It was truly awesome! All of the tapas seem to be vere fresh and I recommend ordering from the daily menu (although it is only in Catalan and we didn't really had a clue what to expect). Be adventurous and enjoy the great food!
4340,5-06-2013 ,4.0,"This was the first restaurant for dinner we went to (and also the last place for lunch because it was that good!). The restaurant has a real buzz about it in the evenings, on a friday night we waited nearly 2 hours for a table, but happily sipped away at the sangria in the meantime. Yes the wait is long, but that's because its so popular, waiting customers spilled out onto the street and even the locals go here.Grabbing a few seats at the tapas bar is difficult in the evenings, but we managed fine at lunchtime. The tapas selection is wide and varied. A tip is to try sit at the tapas bar if your not quite sure what to order, you can just point to most of the dishes. The food is also great value for money, dinner set us back roughly 35euros. The staff are also helpful despite it being very crowded in the evenings. We highly recommend this restaurant if your in the area, do drop by to soak up the atmosphere."
4341,4-06-2013 ,5.0,"This was the first tapas place me and my friends visited in Barcelona. It was very nice, the service was very good. The interior was quite nice, could sit outside if you want to. When we were there, it was quite a busy afternoon so the place was a bit crowded. I was surprised at the reasonable price of the dishes. Recommend this place and will revisit next time in the city. The food was absolutely brilliant, atmosphere was great. Everyone had a good time here."
4342,3-06-2013 ,4.0,Great Restaurant in a great location - don't be put off has a very large restaurant upstairs as well as smaller downstairs. Staff are fantastic and always friendly willing to chat - On a visit in 2005 owner even called cava to arrange a visit for my wife and family! My kids 14 and 17 also loved it.Food is also very good my wife and I returned in May 2013 staff were equally as friendly!Very reasonably priced even for just a coffee.
4343,3-06-2013 ,5.0,"Many other reviewers have already been down this road, but I can't say enough good things about the quality of the tapas, the friendliness of the staff and the speed and efficiency of the service -- at a place where a 45-minute wait is the norm!I'm told (and believe) waiting is part of the tapas experience, but this place is definitely worth the wait with a wide array of Catalonian specialties, as well as typical tapas fare and fresh, delectable seafood. Though it's a cerveceria, we didn't drink any beer -- the vino tinto was too enticing. It's the one restaurant we went to twice during our stay in Barcelona, if that helps.Get there early, grab a glass of wine from the harried though excellent bar staff, step outside, light up a cigarillo (Barcelona really needs to step up its cigar game -- my only complaint about that fine city) and relax, drinking in the cheery hubbub of the Eixample until you're retrieved and taken to your table. You'll be tucking into your patatas bravas in no time at all."
4344,3-06-2013 ,4.0,"If you want to have fun while eating this place fits to you.really good food, quite crowded place, but, unfortunaltely there is a BUT: quite noisy and expensive (av. price per person 40€ for tapas...)"
4345,3-06-2013 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant browsing TripAdvisor for where to go... it's always confusing when there's so much choice.This restaurant is incredible value for money and the food is delicious. The service is great - they bring your food as and when so it's not too overwhelming. We must have visited at just the right time - we didn't need to queue though when we left, the line was running onto the street.Please go. You won't regret it. I want to go back already....!!"
4346,1-06-2013 ,5.0,"Be there early, cause the wait for a table for two around 9 was an hour. But it was worth it. Order their patatas bravas, delicious! Great service which is really unusual in Barcelona! "
4347,1-06-2013 ,5.0,"Recommended by my discover walks tour guide, arrived at 3 forgetting this was local lunch time. Waited for a while in what I thought was a queue, asked a waiter who took me straight to the front of the queue to have my name written down and was told I'd need to wait 25 minutes for a table, most people left to come back later, I decided to stay and managed to get a table in ten minutes. Ordered a set plate of tapas, which meant that I didn't need to eat dinner that night, well worth the money and it wasn't expensive. Would highly recommend."
4348,29-05-2013 ,5.0,"If you had only 1 night in Barcelona, this is the place to go. Recommended by a friend who lives locally and it's popular with locals and tourists. No reservations, so go early. If you can, get a seat at the bar and enjoy."
4349,29-05-2013 ,4.0,"This is the third time I came here and as always very busy, even at 3 in the afternoon. We had to wait 25 minutes for a table, but this give us enough time to have a quick drink somewhere else. The tapas selection is very big and apart from the typical tapas and montaditos they also have specials of the day and more unusual tapas like artichoke tortilla,girgolas mushrooms with ham etc. The tapas as always were well made and the portions generous. Service and is efficient and the food arrives quickly."
4350,29-05-2013 ,4.0,"We went to this place twice during our 4 day stay in Barcelona. Both times for late lunch/snacks. The first time we sat at a table and I wouldn't recommend it unless you speak and read Spanish well. The tapas menu wasn't at all descriptive and the waiters didn't all speak English well. It was much more fun to sit at the bar, point and eat and drink like we did on our second visit. Also makes it easy to mingle with other patrons for other recommendations in Barca. Great ambience and great value. Good food! "
4351,29-05-2013 ,5.0,"The food is absolutely amazing, all the tapas are worth tasting, but you need to have quiet a budget to eat there! There are others,cheaper but very good tapas bars in Barcelona, but Cerveceria Catalana is worth trying at least once, for the food and for the atmosphere! "
4352,29-05-2013 ,5.0,"Well, maybe yes!! Reservations are not possible. You go there and ""check in"". You'll then get an approx. time for when your table is ready.But the food is excellent - the service too. If you're into really good Tapas and fast serving, this is it. Enjoy..."
4353,28-05-2013 ,4.0,"Staying in Barcelona for a few days, asked the comcierge where to go locally for tapas and this was recommended. Besides being 5-10 minutes walk from our hotel, we found the service good, fast and pleasant. Our waiter spoke English well, but not all did. we were still jet lagged so ordered and ate quickly: prest selection of tapas (peppers, prawns, peepees, calamari, ), spanish omelette, mini hot dogs for the kids and all was excellent. Being lazy he next day, we went again for a more leisurely lunch, and ordered differently and this time with selections from the front counter ( point and cook). Bothnoccasions about €50 for 2 adults 2 children with 1 round juices and draft beer."
4354,28-05-2013 ,5.0,"I spent my first night in Barcelona with a group of 10 people, This restaurant (tapas bar) came highly recommended by some friends of mine who work in barcelona. It was only a few minutes walk from our apartment near the Ramblas and wow we were not disappointed. The bar was very busy and we waited approx 30 mins which was not a problem, the bar atmosphere and tapas were great while we waited for a table. The food in the bar and at the table was fantastic and very reasonably priced. I would recommend thi venue to all."
4355,27-05-2013 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is an excellent Tapas restaurant and a very busy one! We walked from our hotel and arrived a little after 7:30 and were seated immediately. Within 20 minutes of our arrival the crowd and the wait time for a table grew!! All of the staff spoke english and were helpful in explaining the different dishes. We started with a sampler and 2 additional tapas dishes per person. Everything was delicious! Dishes are simply prepared with fresh ingredients and all were so tasty. We ordered a variety of seafood and meat dishes with a couple bottles of red wine. We then ordered 3 desserts which were really good as well! The food comes out quickly, but you do not feel rushed to leave the table. It was a great night, with delicious food and wine!"
4356,27-05-2013 ,5.0,"Recommended by a colleague, we went here on a Friday night. Worst of it first...at 9:30pm we waited for an indoor table 1.25 hours. Nice and inexpensive house wine by the glass while we waited outside on the busy sidewalk eating area. Inside bar area very crowded. Upon being seated we ordered a reasonably priced 1/2 bottle of wine and the best contemporary tapas. I was in heaven. The waiter seemed to think we were ordering too much for two, but we finished every last bite. So delicious! We also went the following night at 7pm and had seating immediately, more delicious tapas and even dessert this time. Highly recommend."
4357,26-05-2013 ,4.0,"Good food, very crowded for me, I prefer quiet places. Everything was very fresh, prices average, friendly service, little porcions but flavoured."
4358,25-05-2013 ,4.0,"You can not pre-book, so you arrive and wait. This is the only downside. Otherwise, the atmosphere is busy and efficient. We chose the Mixed Tapas which came quickly and were tasty. The cost was reasonable. Tapas for 2, a bottle of Rosé and a pudding to share all for under €35.Other restaurants you can book so there is no waiting. If this is not an issue fo you, nn you will not be disappointed."
4359,25-05-2013 ,5.0,This place was recommended by a local and we were thrilled with the quality and variety of tapas. The place was packed yet we easily found seating and enjoyed the helpful service. The best place to sit is inside at the bar to pick your pleasures. Order a little at a time - they come out quickly.
4360,24-05-2013 ,5.0,"So being in Barcelona, I expected to get the best tapas, this was brilliant though. We had to wait a while for a table and it seemed very unorganised. So busy with queues in every direction. We got a table very close to these queues which wasn't great but we were there for the food. Which was brilliant. Very simple menu which was explained by the waiter in full. Overall great restaurant and a must visit in Barcelona, if you're not instantly put off by the biggest queue in the city."
4361,23-05-2013 ,5.0,We pottered down there a bit earlier than the usual late lunch to try and avoid the lines. It was worth it we were seated straight away and enjoyed the view of amazing tapas on display. The bar stools just inside offered a great view of inside and out plus a lot of the tapas can be seen. Our waiter explained anything we weren't sure about on the menu and happily made some recommendations which were all delightful. The food was really good and such a great variety and we didn't wait long even though the place had started filling up to the point of hectic. I would recommend a stop here if you are in Barcelona it is well worth it.
4362,21-05-2013 ,5.0,"Had to queue about 30-40 min at 4 in the afternoon! to get a table but it was well worth it.Service is prompt, polite and helpful although they are very busy.The tapas are amazing, we had patatas bravas, foie gras, mini burger, hot dog, manchego, croquetas...and more. I recommend all of them. Everything on the menu is excellent.Just be prepared to queue or go at noon on the dot.Best tapas place in barcelona"
4363,21-05-2013 ,5.0,"I've been there the second time and it was amazing. We arrived at nine, but had to wait more then one hour. But that's normal for Barcelona for the really good places. We ate a lot of tapas with four persons, drunk a lot and paid around 100-120€. Absolutely recommendable!"
4364,21-05-2013 ,4.0,"Nice place to go with some friends the place is always packed so expect a little bit of waiting time or call ahead, prices are not high and the tapas are awesome."
4365,20-05-2013 ,5.0,"We walked straight in and got a table on a Sunday lunchtime, but a queue soon formed in the doorway. Despite clearly being a guidebook staple, it didn't feel overly touristy and the food was great. We feasted on pimientos de padron, excellent pan con tomate, garlic-heavy mushrooms, manchego cheese, croquetas, tender grilled veal, and a delicious one-bite mini-hamburguesa. The seafood dishes going out looked great too. With a couple of Cokes, a carafe of wine, and a shared Crema Catalana, the bill was about 40 euros - a total bargain for the quality in such a buzzy place. Service was on-the-ball and polite. Highly recommended."
4366,19-05-2013 ,4.0,"I ate tapas everyday when I was in Barcelona. I tried 5 different tapas restaurants, but found Cerveceria Catalans the best. I went there three times within 6 days, but the second time, it was over-packed, so I did not eat there. Overall, good atmosphere, average service, reasonable price, good location and the most is, very good tapas. I missed the curled ham, tomato bread and green little peppers there, really yummy. Definitely will go back if I go to Barcelona."
4367,17-05-2013 ,4.0,"Enjoyed the tapas. Good selection of seafood tapas, moderately priced. It's a busy restaurant, very popular, so there's usually a wait for a table and a lot of hustle and bostle. But authentic and service is polite."
4368,17-05-2013 ,5.0,"All the tapas are amazing. you might have to wait for a table cause they dont take reservations, but if you are with 2 or 4 people you will be seated faster than with 3.try, camembert crujiete and also de croquetas de jamon y queso, mini hamburguesas and the sirlion tapa.and the sangriaaa is greatt!"
4369,14-05-2013 ,5.0,"Waited for an hour and a half for the table but it was definitely worth the wait. Great selection of Tapas, a must when in Barcelona"
4370,13-05-2013 ,5.0,"This was the third time we have eaten at the Cerveceria Catalan, every meal and every tapa we have had has been quality. It is an incredibly popular busy restaurant, full of locals and tourists. The range of tapas is lengthy and the specials of the day can hold some real treasures. From the specials of the day we picked razor clams and clams which were the best we have had. There is always a queue for a table, the shortest wait we have had is 30 minutes, you are advised of the waiting time and you can get a drink while you wait. Once you are seated the service is friendly and efficient and the atmosphere although a bit frenetic is a cheery one. The price comes out at about 35 euros a head for two fairly hungry adults. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone willing to wait half an hour."
4371,12-05-2013 ,4.0,"Fantastic tapas! Great service and the place has a nice buzz around it. Try and get a place at the bar! Try the Gamba a la plancha, or the alcahofas, or the grilled vegetables. Make reservations to avoid to queue, the place is packed with locals."
4372,11-05-2013 ,4.0,"Recommended by a friend of mine who lived in Barclona, this place is great if you want to get away from the tourist trap restaurants along the Passeig de Joan de Borbó (by Barceloneta) and experience real tapas at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is very lively as well and caters to all ages (primarily 20-30s and up) and there is certainly something for everyone. Get there a little early or plan to grab a few drinks before hand."
4373,11-05-2013 ,5.0,"We came here on a Friday night, we were told we'd have to wait 1 hour 15-30 mins for a table (they don't take reservations). We went to a bar for a drink for 45 min then returned. We waited in the bar area and were called after 25 mins. When we sat down we were overwhelmed with choice, we chose 12 plates (4 people) 2 beers and a bottle of cava. The service was fast and pleasant and the atmosphere was lovely. We were all playing a game of guess the bill and were all happy we lost as the lowest guess was €100 and the bill was €82. Great value and amazing food. Plus David Coulthard was there so it must be good if a formula one driver shows up. "
4374,11-05-2013 ,2.0,"Such a shame this restaurant has been refurbished, now with a very contemporary look and feel. The original was much more inviting. The majority of the staff appear to be Chinese or Asian, and not what you might expect in a Spanish tapas restaurant. The tapas menu has been significantly reduced since our last visit, along with a very basic wine list that we assume appeals to tourists. They served a Greek salad, but with mozzarella, not feta! This restaurant has lost it's identity."
4375,10-05-2013 ,5.0,"Excellent dinner with a huge crowd of local and tourist guests. We had to wait for almost 2 hours, signing in at peak hours at 21.30 on a saturday. But, as you can wait while enjoying drinks from the bar or hoover for seats in the bar, the wait can also be an enjoyable relaxing ""peopleviewing"" opportunity. I would recommend it to any friend, any day."
4376,10-05-2013 ,3.0,"The look of a dish is surely as important as the taste, so sitting at the bar gives your eyes participation in putting together your meal; but when with friends, it is antithetic to free flowing conversation, so we opted wait about 20 minutes for a table. The tapas menu contains the standard selection you would find in most barcelona tapas bar, so we picked primarily from the daily specials. We had a really good pasta with chantarelles, a mushroom omelette, and a few seafood dishes from the regular menu (grilled cuttlefish was good). We enjoyed a catalunyan white wine to pair with our meal. Ended with an excellent coconut custard dessert. The service was ok, restrooms were clean, waiters were busy but bored. I think this is an ok place to have a meal if you are not the adventuorus type who would happily walk into a local tapas bar.A few things to watchout for. Check your bill; they could unintentionally forget to remove an item (for us it was the fried artichokes), even when they inform you (only after you follow up) that they had run out of it. Sitting outdoors may look nice but it is on a busy street so could be both noisy and unhealthy. Toilets are upstairs."
4377,9-05-2013 ,5.0,"You can make a reservation and dine at he restaurant --which is great--, but if you're up for some fun, try to get a seat at the bar and you'll have the best tapas ever. Their codfish is the best I've ever had --and I was in Portugal a few months ago and their can cook any fish. go and enjoy not only the tapas, but the wole experience--sitting next to strangers and becoming friends with them over tapas and great wine..."
4378,8-05-2013 ,4.0,"I do enjoy this restaurant...I've been there twice, and food is excellent. BUT, I believe it's overhyped. The service first of all is pretty bad. No personalities are found there in the waiters. It seems nobody wants to be there. I did find a hair underneath our jamon, showed the waitress, she took the plate, brought us back the jamon that was left on the other plate but in a smaller one. LOL. Can't make this stuff up."
4379,8-05-2013 ,5.0,"We had to wait about 1:30 hour to get a table but it worth the wait. I would suggest to book for a table in advance :)The Tapas were perfect, the Sangria was refreshing and the desserts were tasty. I really appreciated the fact that the staff was extremely efficient. We were approached quick and we will served really fast. I would recommend you their ""Jamon Cerano"", the ""Patatas Bravas"" and the ""Calamar a la Romana""!"
4380,7-05-2013 ,5.0,Dinner was great at this restaurant. The overall bill is reasonable for 5 persons. Foods and desserts are good. We have a nice evening.
4381,7-05-2013 ,5.0,"As others have mentioned always expect to wait to get a table. Although, don't worry too much you can have a drink outside and enjoy the multicultural atmosphere. The waiters speak English and seemed used to tourists not knowing what to do although mostly its a Spanish crowd (which is a good sign). You just give them a name and wait until they call. Wait was at least an hour on sat night at 22.00, then 30 mins at 21.00 on Sunday. It's worth it though as the tapas is delicious, the service good (considering how busy they are) and its all reasonably priced. We paid abut 37 euros for 6 plates, 2 beers (at 2.3 euros per beer the cheapest we had in Barca) and a glass of wine."
4382,7-05-2013 ,5.0,"We came here on our last night in Barcelona on a friend's recommendations. I had been expecting a little back street, smoky, dark place with locals reading the papers etc. so i hve to admit i was cautious when i saw the interior and wasn't looking forward to it. Although we had to wait about half an hour, we got a table and started to order. We had a few questions about what things were and the waiter was only happy to assist. We started to order, and OH MY GOD, the food was great! Had a great selection between two of us, but the memorable things were the fried whitebait, prawn skewers and the veal. If i hadn't been feeling a little delicate from the previous night still i could happily have sat there and eaten myself into the breakfast hours! Finished off with a pumpkin cake and sweet wine which were divine.The bill was a pleasant surprise, and we found it very reasonable. I'm returning to Barcelona in July for my mum's 50th birthday and this is the restaurant we are going to for the night. A great lively buzz, fantastic mix of local and expat/tourists plus wonderful service.Highly recommend!"
4383,7-05-2013 ,5.0,"This restaurant apparently offers only tapas and it was the our introduction to it.We got in after an hour wait on the waiting list which we did not regret after allWe got in at 11 pm and the place was still full of people in addition to the ones on the waiting listThe service was very efficient despite this and the waiter was friendly, explained the menu , answered our questions, made recommendations and also noted our diet preferences as my friend was veiled so he noticed we were Muslims and cautioned us on foods that included pork There were a lot of locals too do you sence you are in a good restaurant that offers an authentic food experience "
4384,7-05-2013 ,4.0,"Great tapas and montaditos, busy place but you give your name at the entrance and they call you as soon as a table or a seat at the bar is ready. Great ""Croquetas"" and good Sangria. Try this place before leaving Barcelona"
4385,7-05-2013 ,5.0,"Very busy if you're a standard seating eater (table), just choose the right hour, a bit of patience and a bar seat will be available... Then ready to eat nice an different special ""montaditos"" or small original plates... Alcachofas fritas : divine !!!"
4386,6-05-2013 ,4.0,"Busy with local people and tourists, good tapas selection that we had. This was recommended by spanish people who we met their..great result"
4387,6-05-2013 ,5.0,"We went here the first evening of my holiday getting there at 8pm thinking it was early for Barcelona - boy was we wrong! It was packed and had a huge queue outside. The second evening, we planned to get here early at 6pm (we had a lighter lunch to compensate). There was STILL a queue. We waited though and put ourselves on the list inside (they don't take reservations - it's first come, first served). We probably waited around 20 minutes then saw that someone had left their table outside. Turns out that there is also a separate waiting list for outside so we put ourselves on here as well. I recommend doing the same so you get a better chance of a table, then simply inform either outside or inside that you have a table already, so they can take you off theirs.Luckily we got one outside and that's when the fun began. We ordered a number of tapas of the menu - anchovies, croquettes, manchego cheese etc, and a couple of bottles of wine. We stayed there a good few hours munching and drinking away and everything was good quality. The bill came to 70 Euros between us, which considering how much we had was superbly good value. We gave a 10% tip because it was good service, but the group of people sitting next to us who struck up a conversation in English, said that this was excessive. So it's not a requirement. The second time we went was on our last day on Sunday. We skipped breakfast and turned up at 11.45am. There was still a queue then (because people came in for breakfast/coffee), but only waited 15 minutes or so before a table became available. Once again, we had a multiple number of dishes - all good (although the baby calamari is nicer than the small calamari), and a bottle of wine + the house dessert. The bill came to 44 Euros for 2, because this time we calmed down on the alcohol.Sorry to waffle, but it was such a fun atmosphere. Top tip would be to get there early - skip a previous meal or go lighter on another meal. Once you have a seat you're under no pressure to leave, so take your time and enjoy yourself. You can order a few items at a time, order drink etc. I think it's polite to make sure you're spending money gradually (one women sat for an hour nursing a coffee whilst on the phone, oblivious to the queues forming). but if you don't want to spend 2 hours waiting you need to get there before 12pm for lunch, and before 6pm for dinner."
4388,6-05-2013 ,5.0,I have tried quite a few of tapas and pinchos restaurants in Barcelona and this is the best and tastiest of all of them.
4389,5-05-2013 ,5.0,Cannot recommend this place more. Be prepared for queues as seemed busy at all times and they don't take bookings but the wait is worth it! The price of the tapas was very reasonable and you can see the food on the counters as you come in which makes it difficult to choose. Would recommend the 'flauta' for lunch which is sandwich. Also the goats cheese with red pepper and aubergine tapas was very nice.
4390,5-05-2013 ,5.0,"This is a large Tapas restaurant that is always crowded. Usually, at the busiest time the wait time for a table can be 45 minutes. You can also sit at the bar or eat earlier or later than the main lunch and dinner times (11:30- 2 or 7-9 pm). We had about 9 different dishes including the fried small fish (amazing with lemon juice on them), Spanish omelette, also delicious with onions and potatoes inside, grilled clams with garlic, so goooood!, grilled shrimp. Note: the grilled shrimp come whole with the heads and skins. You must peel them yourself. Too greasy for me; Grilled octopus with potatoes, which were served on a wood platform and were delicate and so tender, veal medalians and hamburger sliders both very tasty. We had the creme brulee and lemon cake, accompanied by cappuccinos, for dessert. The lemon cake was outstanding; so light and it came with a dollop of whip cream. The entire bill, including a liter of delicious sangria and tip was about $100. Service was excellent! This was a great way to share many different Spanish specialty dishes at reasonable prices. The food was fresh and very tasty."
4391,4-05-2013 ,5.0,"I travel to Barcelona once a year to watch football, and every time I take my mates to this fine restaurant. It is positioned in a rather expensive part of Barcelona, but the price range is still average (compered to northern Europe). The service is very good as well. We ask for tapas and drinks for everyone, and are always served a perfect combined menu. This menu contains advanced tapas courses (in spanish), and not only the basics, so if you are a tapas rookie ask the waiter to recommend something for you."
4392,3-05-2013 ,4.0,"A very nice place with amazing tapas! The place is always a busy spot which brings a nice atmosphere. However, be careful if you want to go eat there, you really need a booking!"
4393,3-05-2013 ,5.0,This was a great place to experience tapas - when you arrive go in and get your name down on the booking register - at 1030pm on a thursday we had to wait for about 70 minutes - go early or around 1130 to have less of a wait the whole experience was worth it - they have English menus for those of us who are unable to speak Spanish and the waiters were very good at explaining those items we did not understand - service was good and they were very prompt at getting the plates out We had 11 plates followed by 4 deserts for 65 euros plus 2 half bottles of red for 8.5 each - total bill for 4 was 82 euros plus tip
4394,3-05-2013 ,5.0,From beginning to end the food here is phenomenal. The service is great too. When we're in Barcelona we eat here multiple times.
4395,30-04-2013 ,5.0,"If you want great tapas, brilliant atmosphere, trendy bar setting, great service and fantastic value....look no further. You have to wait 30 or more minutes but get a drink and wait!!! Its worth while. Staff are fantastic. Loads of energy and always smiling. PS 3 visits in as many weeks and consistent every time. Our favourite restaurant in barca!! Thanks to all the staff your brilliant."
4396,30-04-2013 ,4.0,"We splashed out quite a bit, for tapas though it was a fairly good price! We spent £60 for 3 of us and had champagne, 2 puddings and lots of mains. The food was all incredible and full of flavour. The service was very quick- get their early though as it was very very busy! Also some of the staff struggled to understand when I asked for no cheese on my burger, they brought another plate with cheese on it instead- expecting me to pay for it! We soon cleared that up though. For the price I paid though i did expect to be feel a little fuller and I dont usually eat huge portions anyway!"
4397,30-04-2013 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by the hotel staff while I was there in Barcelona. The tapas are excellent, food amazingly good. The prices are super SUPER good, A dinner for two with 1 and 1/2 bottle of wine, 10 tapa dishes sharing, and dissert for 55 euros, you can't bit that anywhere, not even at Taller de Tapas which is great too. The glass of wine 2.5 Euros and is a great wine. The service was fast. The ambiance was great, good music, excellent...I can't wait to go again."
4398,29-04-2013 ,5.0,One word sums it up - EXCELLENT - make sure you try it when in Barcelona !Tapas second to none - so much choice. The staff are very helpful and friendly
4399,28-04-2013 ,4.0,"Lots of options at this Tapas restaurant. Unlike other tapas restaurants, this place is family friendly. I could get my octopus, but they had mini hot dogs and hamburgers for the little ones. a variety of choices. the french fries with egg on top are great (I cant remember what it was called though). the service was friendly and the food was good. seafood, meats, etc. Family friendly!!!"
4400,28-04-2013 ,4.0,Friends have raved about Catalana and we were keen to try it. From when you first see the queues outside you expect something good. The bars is covered with beautiful fresh tapas - truly mouthwatering. We waited for twenty minutes before going to our table- which was basically next door from the entrance. this room had a lot less atmosphere and you did feel like you were eating in a food court. Next time I will wait for a table on the terrace or in the main restaurant
4401,27-04-2013 ,5.0,"We had lunch here, we had to wait 40mins for a table but it was worth it. We had delicious rice dishes with cod & wild mushrooms, followed by perfectly cooked anchovies. The service good. The place was full of local office workers. "
4402,25-04-2013 ,5.0,"There are many places for tapas in Barcelona with different qualities and all of them more or less are fairly good but there is no comparison with the tapas at this place. There are two reasons why there are so good. First of all the turnover is very high. No matter at what time you go it is always full. Second, the quality of the food is top. Even the tortilla de patatas (potato omelette) it is made right for you with goods eggs and excellent potatoes.This simple dish it is so hard to find it so well made it. Don't miss this place if you ever come to Barcelona."
4403,22-04-2013 ,4.0,"If you want to have good tapas this is the place to go, but be aware of the prices. It has a lot of different tapas, some of them to share, some of them need to be ordered single, like the solomillo which is delicious."
4404,22-04-2013 ,4.0,"A great Spanish tapas bar. Well worth a visit, very busy great atmosphere good food. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Restaurant is centrally located. All staff spoked English which made it easier to get description on dishes.Lots of Spanish frequent this great place to eat so it must be good. Highly recommend."
4405,21-04-2013 ,4.0,"Certainly one of the best tapas places in Barcelona, with a good quality-price ratio. Affordable prices and delicous tapas. Don't go there looking for peace, though. It's a very hectic place, the waitresses run around and may be a bit rude. Had a good experience there though, even if the service was quite disappointing. Be prepared to wait 10-30 minutes to get a table."
4406,21-04-2013 ,5.0,We went during lunch 2ish--Still full but we were seated right away. The next day we got there a little earlier and got a seat at the bar. FUN!!
4407,19-04-2013 ,5.0,"When in Barcelona don't miss this place. Be prepared to wait for 30-60 minutes for a table, but just order a glas of wine in the bar and enjoy. The food is to die for, everything is so fresh and well prepared. We have been there three times now and every time it's great, it's crowded but nice and have to say it again, what food. Don't be afraid to ask the waiters and please try new tapas, i still have to find something i dont love. And the best for last, it is so cheap, coming from Sweden it was a hugh surpise that food that good can be priced like this. Go ther and enjoy your self."
4408,17-04-2013 ,5.0,"I heard about this place after it was recommended to me by one of my colleagues and what a recommendation. The restaurant is located in a great part of town and is very clean and upbeat. They don't take reservations but I would highly advise you to get there around 9 PM to not have a wait. But if you're waiting, it won't be more than 30 mins (usually). The ambiance is very nice and the tapas is great. I always try something different but the one thing I always get are the mini pork sandwiches with bacon on baguette; They're outstanding! I've recommended this restaurant to a few friends who have traveled to Barcelona recently and they love it as well. Highly recommended!"
4409,17-04-2013 ,4.0,"Very good tapas. The size of dishes were good. Make sure you get there early though because the line is long. We had to wait for an hour, but it was easy to find a place nearby to have a glass of wine before heading back.My favorite meal in Barcelona thus far!"
4410,16-04-2013 ,5.0,"Delicious tapas, many different choices, the spanish ""tortilla"" it is something you don´t expect and the fried green peppers are a delicatesse. Great place to see and understand what tapas are "
4411,15-04-2013 ,5.0,Excellent food with great prices! A must in Barcelona. The ambiance is very nice lots of locals as well as tourists!
4412,15-04-2013 ,3.0,Good tapas. A table outside is really great. Good variety. Was expecting better based on the reviews. Was good but not worth going out of you way to get there (as we did). 
4413,15-04-2013 ,5.0,"I went there with high expectations after having read all the good reviews and I can say they were all deserved. the food quality is excellent and the place is pretty nice. Lots of variety of food; when we arrived they told us we had to wait 1 hour, but we were lucky and waited just 30 min."
4414,13-04-2013 ,5.0,"We enjoyed the evening in this cool, tasty place. The veriaty of dishes the ambiant atmosphere and the quality of the food. We will Come back on our next trip to barcelona. "
4415,12-04-2013 ,4.0,My stepdaughter and i just finished dinner here. It was really good. We had read reviews and knew it was good. We went at 9:00 pm which is pretty normal in barcelona. The restaurant was packed. We waited about an hour but had some wine. Our server was wonderful. All the tapas were great. The dessert and cappuccino was too. The total bill with 1/2 bottle of champagne was only 30 euros. 
4416,12-04-2013 ,5.0,"We came for dinner, we ordered about 12 plates of Tapas. All of them were fresh and made from quality products. The atmosphere is ok, the place was full and service was ok."
4417,11-04-2013 ,5.0,"The tapas here are excellent- cream cheese, nut and pineapple flautas, sautéed cuttlefish in parsley and garlic, matchstick potatoes with aioli, hot sauce and eggs... I could go on. We sat at the bar, and were treated to a number of off the menu dishes from the genial chef. The place is crowded, even at 11 or 12, so don't go if you aren't prepared to wait. But if you do, it's highly worth it. The price is unreal- we had 15 dishes between 6 people, wine and all for 10 euros a person. Highly recommended. Our best tapas experience of the trip."
4418,10-04-2013 ,5.0,"Very busy restaurant from same owners as Ciudad Condal. A bit less formal inside. Fried fish, fried camembert, hamburgers, and ""special cake"" were highlights"
4419,10-04-2013 ,4.0,"Be aware of the fact that this is a very popular place, so expect it to be crowded, BUT it is all worth the wait (you can not reserve a table!)The tapas is simply great and reasonably priced. If you are to wait, please do yourself the pleasure of asking for their red Sangria, it is the best I have tasted at least, and it will be a perfect start for what to come.So all in all simply great, the last star if the wine list improoves ;o)"
4420,10-04-2013 ,4.0,"Since tapas are a must when in Barcelona, expect that all tourist areas, especially along La Rambla and Rambla de Catalunya, are packed with tapas bar. If you don't know where to go, it can be pretty overwhelming and there's a chance that you'll end up in a mediocre, pricy tapas bar. Here, enters my favorite tapas bar in Barcelona, the Cerveceria Catalana.Cerveceria Catalana is located at Carrer de Mallorca 236. Coming from Placa Catalunya, walk up to Ramblas de Catalunya (not La Ramba, the street directly opposite to it). It is a bit of a walk but Ramblas de Catalunya is a nice street to explore as well. On your left, you will eventually see a MAC store (the make-up brand, not Apple) - that would be Carrer de Mallorca. Cerveceria Catalana is not to be missed! This tapas bar remains to be my favourite among all the tapas bars I’ve tried in Barcelona. The quality of food they have is such a treat to those who travel for the love of food. They don’t take reservations so be warned of long queues during peak hours. I rated this tapas bar with the following:Location (4/5)Food (5/5)Ambiance (3.5/5)Price (4.5/5)Service (4.5/5) My full review on Cerveceria Catalana is found at http://writtenbyicar.wordpress.com/2013/04/10/cerveceria-catalana-my-all-time-favorite/"
4421,10-04-2013 ,5.0,"This is a great Tapas restaurant. Very central and always very busy so as i always say, be early. And be prepared to wait as it is touristic. We prefer to sit at the bar and watch the action. The food is excellent with a huge selection and the deserts a must. A Barcelona experience."
4422,9-04-2013 ,5.0,"This was a very pleasant surprise. Good blend of locals and tourists (at least during Easter). It was quite busy, so unless you are very early (before 9 pm) expect to wait about one hour for a table. The food is worth waiting for and you will not be ruined when it's time to pay..."
4423,9-04-2013 ,1.0,"Please don't go there, your money is much better spent anywhere else.Its busy and ok that we (and anyone else) had to wait, but they call your name on the speaker, the interieur is poor and the food is so greasy, - we ate 5 other places in barcelona and this is the worst experience we had in a long time ( dont trust your hotel if they say its the best tapas). We ordered, looked at the food tasted everything, paid and went to another restaurant. But sometimes you have to try something really bad to know what is good :)"
4424,8-04-2013 ,5.0,"We enjoyed our first meal at this contemporary tapas bar. Place was filled with both locals and tourists. There were so many people in the restaurant there was hardly anyway to stand , luckily we only had to wait for 20 minutes. The tapas were fresh, flavorful and delicious. We ordered the assorted tapas, fried small fish and small squid and of course bread with tomato and a pitcher of sangria . Our bill was 46 euros which was incredibly cheap for the quality of the dishes served. Everything was really great and plan to visit again"
4425,8-04-2013 ,4.0,Wow this place was crazy trying to get a table. Friend recommended and didn't realize what we were walking into. Arrived at 10pm on a Sunday and got seated at 11:30 for 2 people. Pitcher of Cava Sangria made the hour go by quickly. Food was fantastic. Waiter left in the middle of dinner without telling us. Decor reminded me of Olive Garden in the US. All in all it was ok. 
4426,8-04-2013 ,5.0,"Make sure you can wait, it will be busy. Or go a bit early and enjoy the crowd. The Tapas are varied, ask. ??.........if you like Sushi, this is the place to be."
4427,8-04-2013 ,5.0,"This is a fabulous place for a tapas fan. Well located, easy to get to BUT after that it gets a bit complicated- you have to arrive really early, we have learnt. We got there at 8pm on a friday in june and were told that it would be a 90 minute wait. We went back nice and early the next day -got there at 6pm! and the wait was about 20mins only. Remember there are NO reservations, and it is an EXTREMELY BUSY restaurant.Make sure you catch the 'booking' waiter's eye and get them to write your name down. Then you can relax in the bar with a drink or just hang around to be called.Once ensconced in your seat, you will be pleasantly surprised at 3 things- 1- How good the tapas is- 2- How quick the service is, and -3- How relaxed the waiters are about the time you take at your table- they tend not to hassle you to finish up and push off in a hurry. Prices are very reasonable- choice of food is more than adequate- quality of produce is excellent. We have been there twice and will keep going there when in Barcelona. Apart from the queuing up, what's not to like?!"
4428,8-04-2013 ,5.0,"Recommended by our tour guide this place did not disappoint. Very fast service but that is to be expected for tapas. Try the veal loin - stuning and the mini hamburgers. The desert - the almond cake I think called Santiago is a must. Beautiful , moist homemade with a small glass of fortified wine to go with it. Good value too. Busy and buzzy atmosphere. Get there before 1.00pm as it gets very busy!"
4429,8-04-2013 ,5.0,"This restaurant is brilliant. We had 7 kinds of tapas, they were all delicious and fullfilling, we had 5 drinks also, and the bill was about 45 euros, which was very good, considering the area and Barcelona and all. The staff was very helpfull, they immediately led us to a table, brought our menus and served us drinks, while we were checking the menu. Our order came very fast, considering that the restaurant was packed with people, most of them turists. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
4430,7-04-2013 ,4.0,On our first day our tour guide Victor brought us here for lunch. We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 6 because we came just before lunch (1:15). Lunch in Barcelona starts at 2pm.We had various tapas. Most interesting was their squid. The mini burger was a real mini but good. I had a chorizo on bread with cheese. Just okay. Good experience here.
4431,6-04-2013 ,5.0,"This is a very popular restaurant. We arrived at about 7.45pm and had to wait about 15 mins for a table for four. Give your name to the waiter at the desk and they will call you when a table is available - the system does work! Although busy, once seated there was no rush to finish your meal. The food was excellent, the staff helpful and the atmosphere lively. We had a lovely evening here and would recommend it."
4432,5-04-2013 ,5.0,"This place had unbelievable food! It was recommended to me by someone who had lived in Barcelona before. You might need to wait a bit but it is well worth the wait.It a nice place, with amazing tapas (especially the seafood dishes) and great sangria. We loved it so much that we went there twice even though we were only im Barcelona for 3 days and had plenty of other places on our list.Not to be missed!"
4433,5-04-2013 ,4.0,the waiter suggest to me six tapas which i found it tasty. the restaurant was full. the waiters are friendly. The prize normal and the service was fast. 
4434,4-04-2013 ,5.0,"Book, go for a walk and a drink, then come back in time for your table. Great fun and good food. Really worth it, especially the devilled eggs with chips. "
4435,4-04-2013 ,5.0,"Lovely restaurant, great food and brilliant atmosphere. We tried to book but were told they don't make reservations so headed there around 8pm and only had to wait 15 minutes. Service was quick but friendly. Our waitress spoke great English and was very helpful. A must-go for great food in Barcelona. "
4436,4-04-2013 ,3.0,"While highly rated and crowded we found this restaurant lacking for the following items and should not be ordered: Jamon (tasted flat vs others), mini-burger (small for the price,beef lacked flavor. too greasy),pork fluata (again, lacked flavor/over salted), and bread (yes, the charge 2.5E or so for a few slices of bread to enjoy with the jamon.)Many other items, including sea food, coming out of the kitchen looks good.Good luck with your choices"
4437,4-04-2013 ,5.0,"This place is really nice. When you arrive , make sure the staff writes down your name , you will have to wait - but it's really worth it! Food is DELICIOUS, great value for money, Staff friendly , nice location "
4438,4-04-2013 ,5.0,Lovely place to go with real good food. No reservations so go early lunch or early dinner otherwise no table !!! Good relation between quality and price reason why is always full
4439,3-04-2013 ,3.0,"Food was below expectations (after reading all the reviews) but still good nonetheless, just not exceptional. I tried to get a table for 3 a few days ago and was treated horribly by the hostess taking names down for tables etc. Ignored me initially (and several times) when I tried to ask how long it would take to get a table and when she finally decides to acknowledge me she raised her hands in exasperation as if to say I was in her way. This should not be how customers are treated, no matter how busy it is/how good the food is. I returned today because of the excellent reviews and am glad to say my experience with the staff today was much better. On a side note, does anyone know if they share owners with Ciutat Comtal..? which isn't too far from it. The dishes were similar."
4440,3-04-2013 ,5.0,"Tried this restaurant after eating Tapas at La Flauta and it was much better. Waited probably about an hour but get a bottle of the house wine while waiting, it is only 8 Euro. The waiter knew exactly what we needed to order and was very helpful and friendly. My favorite tapas were the fried cheese sticks with jelly on top. It sounds weird but they were amazing! I want to go back for more! The bill came to 22 Euros a person which is pretty reasonable! A must visit when in Barcelona!!"
4441,2-04-2013 ,5.0,"Cerveceria and Tapas are 2 words thrown around and used so liberally when you're in Barcelona. And what comes with pent up tourist demand is a lot of mediocrity. If you're like me you'd avoid the tourist traps of La Ramblas and wont be scared to venture out to Cerveceria Catalana. Spoiled locals agreed that this place was the right choice. It's not far from La Sagrada Familia so maybe take a walk before or after. Also, get in quick as this place gets busy. I'd suggest 7:30 for dinner. We were there on a Saturday for lunch around 1 and had to wait 20 minutes (not bad) considering queues here can be massive. TIP: If you dont speak Spanish, ask for Marc in the restaurant English speaking waiter. Also great guy. "
4442,2-04-2013 ,4.0,"This is my first time in Barcelona, and having been here for 3 days, I have tried out various different tapas restaurants/ bar, seafood etc at the Market. I always wanted to try eating tapas at the bar table being able to look at the different food on display and pick & eat when u feel like it, instead of being at the table looking at the menu and having to order food via the waiter etc. So I went in a group of 3 at around 4 pm for an afternoon tea (had a light lunch), only waited for 3 minutes and got ourselves a comfy corner at the seafood side of the bar tables!! We just ordered dishes batch by batch coz I can never judge whether the portion ll be enuf. The staff was extremely helpful and patient with me, explaining each tapas and how it is prepared, and what sauces etc ll be used. So overall we ordered 10 tapas. The seafood selection was good. Special mention to the razor clams! Very fresh, soft and juicy, clean inside (no sands). The prawns, cod skewer, garlic catfish were average. Non seafood wise, had the duck and apple served with warmed pate which was delicious! I also loved the fried camebert with nuts and jam which melt in ur mouth but at the same time not overly rich. Other dish I liked was the avocado pasta salad with tomato bread, a very light refreshing dish to balance out the other oily grilled tapas! for dessert, had the creme caramel, which is a less creamy version of the creme brûlée, the caramel layer was slightly over burnt, so lil disappointment there.Drink wise had a white wine and their sangria which I personally find slightly better than the other ones i have had because it was less sweet. In terms of price, I find it reasonable compared to the 3 tapas bars I have been to. Turn out to be 20 euros each, including the jug of sangria, bottle of white and 10 tapas~ So for me, I enjoyed it very much, the atmosphere, the experience of seeing the food available and ordering dishes by dishes, watching them prepare! Definitely recommend if u are looking for similar experience!"
4443,2-04-2013 ,4.0,This is a very known and/but touristic place. Always full and no reservations possible. Breakfast are good and not expensive. You normally always get the chance to have a sit at the bar during the morning. Tapas are good and not so overpriced. It's worth the experience although it was better 10 years ago.
4444,31-03-2013 ,3.0,"Maybe I'm just spoiled because I've been living in BCN for more than a year now, but I really don't get the hype about this place. I've just finished eating there, and the food quality is right about the same as in every tapas bar on the outskirts of the city. However, the neighborhood it's in is really nice. And here's where the compliments end.This place has better rating than Maitea (similar concept)!? Not even close. What you get is an oversize restaurants, packed with tourists (which means that at least everything is really, really fresh), with average food, and a little on the pricey side, again, comparing it with similar places like this one. Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, just very very average.However, something I didn't like was that I was told to wait 15 minutes, and waited 25, and after that I was attended in a ""hurry-up-and-eat"" manner by a waitress who forgot her smile home. There are better places to eat, trust me! Also, I found the name funny, as they don't have any Catalan beer."
4445,31-03-2013 ,5.0,"This restaurant is close to La Pedrera (Casa Mila), worth going when visiting Gaudi's attraction. We found out this restaurant through Trip Advisor City Guides (very nice offline app!). The place is beautiful and nice, service was great (patient and attentive), we tried other tapas restaurants but really like this one and came twice during our 5 days stay in BCN. Brava potatoes, octopus, shrimp stick, romana squid were excellent, and the hot camembert cheese DELICIOUS! We arrived at 12:30 to have lunch and lots of tables were available, but there was a line to get a table when we were leaving the restaurant."
4446,31-03-2013 ,5.0,"We arrived, on advice, at 8pm to join the 40 minute queue but added our names and headed round the corner for a drink. When we got our table it was lovely decor and the staff were friendly though we ordered far too much! Wine mark ups were minimal. Food was traditional and tasty. Would highly recommend"
4447,28-03-2013 ,5.0,"This place was suggested by the hotel concierge and backed by reviews on trip advisor. We reached late around 11:40pm but the place was still full. Was asked to wait 45 mins - 1hr but luckily we were called in within 20 mins. The service was quick, food tastes great and prices excellent. We had a total of 7 tapas (including) two desserts for 2 people and the bill was only 32 Euro. The atmosphere was mostly locals with a few tourists in there as well. Servers were fluent in English and there was a separate English menu too. Will definitely come back to this place. "
4448,28-03-2013 ,4.0,"Had supper here tonight and the food was great. We sat at the bar while we waited for our table, but ended up eating our meal at the bar. It was great fun. We talked to the locals and the bartender was fantastic. We will return befor our trip is over. "
4449,28-03-2013 ,5.0,"We went to this tapas bar after arriving in Barcelona in the late evening. The atmosphere was amazing and the everyone was really friendly. We sat at the bar and our server helped us choose different tapas --we had a really good time, the food was delicious and the beer ice cold! Will be sure to go back on our next visit!"
4450,27-03-2013 ,4.0,We had a 40 minute wait so left our names and headed for The Times for a drink.service was efficient if a little rushed and clinical. The food was of good quality and value. If you want good food served quickly and only want to spend about an hour in the restaurant this is your place. If you want personal service try somewhere smaller and quieter
4451,26-03-2013 ,4.0,"This was recommended to us by the staff at our hotel as providing very good tapas at a reasonable price and a place he would frequent as well. It turned out to be a wonderful recommendation with which many others apparently agreed. We went twice so that we could try more dishes. First time, we had to wait about 15 minutes at a little after 8pm. We went close to 9 pm the second time and were told the wait would be 45 minutes - 1 hour. However, some of the guests might have decided to abandon the wait, as we were actually seated in about 25 minutes. Guests were a mix of locals and tourists. They have a regular menu and a daily special menu. There is an English version of regular menu but not the daily specials. The wait staff, however, all spoke excellent English and were helpful in translating the daily specials. All the dishes we tried were delicious. Some we recommend: ham from the delicatessen (also order the bread to go with it), red pepper stuffed with cod mousse, razor clams (navaja on the daily special menu), fried baby squid, fried green pepper, and the mushrooms. The shrimps were tasty but a little sandy. Prices were very reasonable, mostly in the 5-8 euro range for good size plates. The most expensive was 11.95 euro for 5 razor clams. Our bill came to +/- 50 euro both nights, and we were plenty satiated."
4452,26-03-2013 ,4.0,"typical tapas place. you have to reserve it because it is often fully booked, especially during the week end. the location is nice and the quality is outstanding. it is in a good touristic position, I don't go often here but anyway is a place I can suggest."
4453,25-03-2013 ,5.0,"Our family of 4 arrived at 8:10 on a Monday night and despite the 40 minute wait (which my 15 year old daughter didn't like), the meal was well worth it. Superb, inventive tapas and great service. Excellent value. An interesting combination of locals and tourists (but the latter didn't overwhelm the former). We would definitely return."
4454,25-03-2013 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend who had lived in Barcelona, and told us they served the best tapas you would find anywhere. So we had to try it and we were not disappointed. We accepted that as there were no bookings taken that we would have to wait for a table and waited approx 45mins on both our visits. It can get very cramped with people waiting for tables, so we put our names down and found a quieter bar to have a drink while we waited. Once seated the service was very quick and the staff were very helpful. The only problem we had was that we didn't get to try everything on the menu, although we did our best!"
4455,25-03-2013 ,5.0,Excellent selection of tapas. We went late lunchtime and restaurant was packed. Buzzy atmosphere. Had to wait approximately 20 mins but spent the time deciding what to choose from the wide variety of tapas displayed at the front of the restaurant. All looked very fresh. Staff friendly and welcoming and happy to describe the tapas and make recommendations. Not overly expensive and great value for money. Definitely go back.
4456,24-03-2013 ,4.0,We really enjoyed eating at this restaurant. We were in the sit down part of the restaurant. It was very busy but we only had to wait maybe 15 min for a table at around 6:30-7. They have a wide variety of tapas and something for everyone's taste. It is fun walking in and seeing all the options sitting on the counters. I would recommend for a tapas dinner.
4457,24-03-2013 ,5.0,"Fantastic tapas restaurant a short walk from placa de catalunya. We had read trip advisor reviews before going so knew that it gets busy but luckily this restaurant does not close between lunch and dinner like a lot of other Barcelona restaurants so we went early (between 5 and 6) and got a table without having to wait although the restaurant was still crowdedI had never tried tapas before so the first time we went we ordered the assorted tapas which had a good mix of food groups. We were so impressed and saw so many lovely dishes going to other tables that we went back a couple of days later. I thoroughly recommend the fried anchovies! The staff were great, very helpful when asked for recommendations and despite the bustle there was never a long wait.Beautiful food, reasonable prices. "
4458,23-03-2013 ,5.0,"I loved it so much I had to be back the next day. Wonderful tapas. Too crowded, so it is better to go early or at 4pm. Everything is so tasty, you can't go wrong. Really good, hope to be back soon."
4459,23-03-2013 ,4.0,"Tapas at this restaurant are top class. Really busy spot - we arrived at 7pm on a sat - the wait was 1hr for inside or we had the option of being seated straight away on the outside terrace seats. Hungry, we went for the el fresco option - the quality of tapas was really really excellent. Thoroughly recommend this place. Our waitor was a little unfriendly hence i'm npt giving them 5 stars. Really reasonable too. Will defo go back!"

Hence, we went back again few days ago (Sunday 17th March) and hang around at the tapas bar , this time it only took us less than 10 mins to 2 seats (930pm ish).Very disappointed with the taste & quality .... grilled razor claim overcooked & very rubbery ; bacalao was so salty ( yes we know is salty but not eating ""salt"") , blah blah Maybe all these good rating in the past had move their focus somewhere else ???Time to move on to so many other good tapas restaurants in town , going back the second time was a mistake & lesson for us .............."
4461,20-03-2013 ,5.0,"One of the best tapas in Barcelona in a modern restaurant not like typical tapas bars. Have been there several times and the quality is always the same with fresh products. It´s always crowded up to 1 hour or more for a table but worth the wait as they don’t take reservations. A good idea is to put your name on the waitlist and come back, as the bar of the restaurant is too crowded. Service is also very good with great attention. Orders are taken quickly and quickly served. They also come to refresh your plate with every new tapas. For cheese lovers the fried camembert is a must to try."
4462,20-03-2013 ,5.0,"We have been there for coffee and Fauta? With fillings. Can't beat it. Great service, fabulous coffee"
4463,19-03-2013 ,5.0,"If you come to Barcelona hungry for beer and tapas, you need to come here.Great selection of beers, friendly service and amazingly tasty food (Tapas and Pintxo).Be prepared for small queues at peak time but it is well worth the wait."
4464,18-03-2013 ,5.0,"Enjoying is about attitude as much as food and it helps to cheer up the waiters, it gets them going and the ball begins."
4465,18-03-2013 ,3.0,"We were warned ahead of time by friends that frequent Cerveceria Catalana to go early and get your name on the list. They were right. The place is packed with people queuing up on the street. Our wait was an hour so we grabbed a quick coffee before heading back for our table.There are a couple of downsides to this tapas restaurant / bar. The first is that due to the number of people who do not know that you need to put your name on the list, one has difficulty getting through the door to do so themselves or to get back inside when their name has been announced. This is due to large groups of people pushing in only to be told to leave their names and go back out to wait their turn. A minor hassle but I wish I didn't have to push past people who then gave me dirty looks and rude comments when trying to get to my table. The other issue is that our waiter forgot that we were there in the sense that he was hard to flag down to order more food / drinks etc. In hindsight that was a good thing as we then did not over eat like we had at Elche Restaurant.The tapas though are excellent. There is a large variety and they are well prepared and very fresh. No wonder this has become the must visit tapas place in Barcelona! There was a group of 4 of us that went here and we chose for dessert to do the mixed cakes. I'm glad we shared that. We recieve 4 HUGE slices of cake (a lemon cake, an almond cake, a coconut cake and a Catalan cake with burnt sugar). We all had some of the cake and it was more than enough. We couldn't finish it all! It was reasonably priced as well at €11.50. On my next visit though I will skip the Sangria. They know how to do a great tapas but the Sangria is weak and tasteless."
4466,18-03-2013 ,5.0,"Great tasting tapas dishes and nice restaurant. Be warned though it gets seriously busy So be prepared to wait. We asked for a table and went for a drink round the corner while we waited. It's not a romantic restaurant at all and is very bustly and noisy but is fantastic value for Barcelona, and is an easy walk from the centre of the city. "
4467,16-03-2013 ,5.0,"I heard so much about this restaurant , and could not wait to eat there! It is everything my friends and TripAdvisor recommended and more...We arrived on a Friday night, around 19:30 , and saw the line from far... but we were very lucky indeed, as it was warm than usual there were tables outside and we got a table in less than five minutes.The place was crowded, cheerful , mixed crowd of locals and tourists!we ordered varies tapas dishes: from sea food dishes ( I liked the sardines and the grilled shrimps the best!) , tiny hamburgers ( yummy!) , entrecote bite size ( wonderful....) , four cheeses.... to complete our order with two Sangria pitchers - everything tasted wonderful! what a great place to dine .Service was very accommodating - it was a perfect evening with Friends in Barcelona. Will definitively go back there on our next trip!"
4468,14-03-2013 ,4.0,"Vibrant, great service and unique tapas. Seat at the bar this is where it's happening. I went there one night, loved it and went back the next night."
4469,14-03-2013 ,5.0,"My favorite lunch spot in Barcelona... I have been to Cerveceria about 10 times. The Tapas are amazingly good!! I wish we had something like this in San Francisco. They don't take reservations... So if you don't arrive before 2pm, you may not get a table."
4470,13-03-2013 ,5.0,This place is the esscence of Barcelona and tapas culture. Worth the wait . Amazing food and a great vibe. Yes very busy but you will taste why!
4471,13-03-2013 ,5.0,"The food was excellent,we need to wait half an hour but its worth,the service was fast and around the atmosphere was great !"
4472,13-03-2013 ,4.0,"we were there in the evening and around 11 am and it was very busy all the time. tapas were really great! however, do not expect much from the service, they are not very friendly)))coffee was also very good, as well as wine."
4473,13-03-2013 ,4.0,"Highly recommended place in a very central location. Full English menu in addition to the spanish ones. Ask for the daily menu (spanish only - usually the best items are on there).Recommended dishes: Mini Hamburgers, Beef skewers, Sepionas a la plancha (small squids from the grill) and Gambas a la Plancha (Big Shrimps from the grill). The house rose is a find (at under 8 euros a bottle)."
4474,12-03-2013 ,5.0,"We went for lunch and despite it being 1:30pm, there was a queue at the door and we had to wait 30minutes to get a table.The restaurant is big, and very busy. The staff are running around all over the place, but when they do get to you, they are very friendly. The food was superb. We tried everything on their daily menu twice, and ordered paella's too, which were equally as good. And what keeps the smile on your face is the bill... after a LOT of food and wine, the bill came to a very reasoable 30euros per person. Highly recommended."
4475,11-03-2013 ,4.0,"The place is great, the staff very dynamic & helpful. The tapas are excellent! we visited this place bc of TA comments and we thank you for this!highly recommended !"
4476,6-03-2013 ,5.0,Nice restaurant in a convenient location serving good fresh food... what more could you ask for? We were seated outdoors and served a range of fresh and well cooked/prepared tapas. I would definitely go back!
4477,6-03-2013 ,4.0,"If you can get in do so and if you can't try again as it is by far the best tapas I've had in years. Good, simple, honest, tasty tapas. You won't be disappointed wait times can be long but so worth it "
4478,6-03-2013 ,5.0,The first time we ate here was a revelation. How could food taste so good? What did they do to the clams that made it so good? How can croquettas taste so yummy? Every other restaurant we ate at pales in comparison. The lines may be long during peak hours but it is so worth the wait. Make sure you eat here at least once in your visit. You will not regret it.
4479,5-03-2013 ,5.0,"Totally the happening place in our hotel proximity. This fun place was busy no matter what the hour, we went at 11:30pm and had an hour wait, we went at 9:30 pm and had a 45 min wait. The food was beautiful and delicious with very reasonable pricing (like half what other tapas restaurants commanded) compared to others in the same neighborhood. The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive... your glass nor your plate is never empty. Try the traditional calcots (chargrilled green onions with a wonderful dipping sauce) - amazing."
4480,5-03-2013 ,5.0,We went here last year while at the same Mobile World Congress event. this was the only restaurant that we came back to the following year and we actually went twice during an 8 day visit.The restaurant opens quite early which is nice in a city where most restaurants open at 8 or 9 PM. They only take reservations from people standing in liine. The restaurant is quite large so they can accomodate a lot of folks with ease. The service is quick and efficient and we enjoyed our stay. It is also quite reasonable. Three of us ate for about 50 euros and we left quite satisfied. Very nice locations within walking distance of the central square.
4481,2-03-2013 ,5.0,"I was worried that being so centrally located the food would be mediocre at best and the prices totally obscene, I was however more than slightly pleasantly surprised by beautiful wine at only €2.95, tapas that was really tasty and priced around the €4-5 mark on average and a mojito to knock your socks right off...it was stunning! This was all enjoyed in stunning surroundings and with friendly, attentive and helpful staff! A definite must go place!! I will surely be back!!"
4482,28-02-2013 ,5.0,"Having been to Barcelona many times before, and enjoyed many great tapas restaurants, my expectations where balanced. Even though the tapas are very simple dishes, I can truely say, this is the best tapas I have ever had. It is reasonably priced, and everything we tried where delicious. Service was quick, and friendly. We went to the restaurant around 18:00, and were told we had to leave again at 20:00. This suited us fine, and at 20:00 the queues to get in where LONG! So if you time your visit right you can avoid the queues, this is a very popular place and now I understand why!"
4483,28-02-2013 ,5.0,"This place is near Passeig de Gracia along the street of c/Mallorca. We`went there at around 6pm. no queues and went straight to the table. Varieties of finger food type( Tapas) with excellnt mushroom, shrimp and iberico jamon for you to choose from. "
4484,26-02-2013 ,4.0,"Really enjoyed dining here. We had to wait an hour for a table but weirdly it's all part of the experience! Its very popular and even though a bit away from the busy town centre, the crowd is a mixture of locals as well as tourists. We loved most of the dishes, especially the red pepper with cod puree, and the classic patatas bravas. The drinks were also good: the rioja stood out. Only niggle was the service: had to wait ages for the bill for example. However I'd recommend it for sure and would definitely go again for a fun night out."
4485,26-02-2013 ,5.0,"useless trying to get a table, queue is neverending and the most exciting thing to do here is waiting for a vacant seat at the counter, putting pressure on those eating, while you're drinking a beer above their heads. do not be shy and yell your order at the attendant from behind. he'll hand your beer (and any other stuff like eg patatas bravas..) out along with the receipt on a tiny metal plate. we sat at the ""fish"" counter (there are 2 ot them, the other one has more like meat/vegetables): quality was superb. price is fair."
4486,25-02-2013 ,5.0,"I know that Barcelona is a big city with many, many restaurants. And I have a rule that I never, never go to the same restaurant twice in a European city in order to sample as many as possible. But my family and I had such a great time at this place the first time, that we went back during the same week. It was GREAT. The first time we were sitting next to a bunch of college girls on break on one side and we were sharing glasses of the fruity sangria, and the table full of spaniards at the other table were recommending tapas for us to try and letting us sample theirs. What a place. It is wall to wall people enjoying life, food and drink. The second time was more subdued, but just as good. It gave us a chance to sample the plates that we had missed the first time, as well as repeat order our favorites. Try everything and anything, especially the local hams, and the peppers."
4487,24-02-2013 ,4.0,"Food is excellent. Restaurant is very cozy. Only reason for four stars is that the wait is often way too long, and a bit touristy. I would definitely go to this restaurant if looking for tapas in Barcelona."
4488,24-02-2013 ,5.0,"I had a friendly talk with my friend about the restaurants in BCN and he reccommended me Cerveceria Catalana. Simple and tasty food, always packed and very popular among the film crews. No chance to get a table reservation - simply queue.HE WAS DAMN RIGHT!!!!! The food was delicious, fast and friendly service. We will never miss it when in BCN. Good advice - it is always full by 21:00 and will wait for at least 45 min for your table. Be there a bit sooner :-)"
4489,24-02-2013 ,5.0,"My all time favorite restaurant the tapas selection is second to none the menu sitting down is also great not rushed even when it must be the busiest and most popular in Barcelona.large dining area and bar stalls if you prefer.expect to wait up to 1 hour at busy times but worth it go for a walk and return to the best you will find,Padron peppers to die for.just on bogey point ,the tax iva is shown as included in price but watch out as they put it on again at the end of the bill, they all seem to try this in Barcelona and get away with it.still ive spent so many nights eating here you seem to forgive ,but it isnt right."
4490,23-02-2013 ,3.0,"Heard from several friends that this cerveceria has wonderful tapas, maybe my expectation was too high after hearing all good foods here. I liked skewed shrimps & salads, but wasn't really impressed so much as I was told. Clean and designed nicely, everybody speaks English so no problem with taking orders."
4491,22-02-2013 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana must be visited if you are looking for excellent tapas in Barcelona. The restaurant is always crowded and reservations are done at place. You can sit in the bar and eat, a excellent way to meet new and interesting people.They have a wide variety of tapas, wines and beers. I tried most of there tapas and everything tasted excellent. On of my favorite was ""Cabreaos"", just try it!The queue can be quite long sometimes but it´s worth waiting for!"
4492,21-02-2013 ,4.0,"It is not a trandy or special place serving innovative foods, but very modern and pleasant bar with traditional spanish tapas and food. Whenever we're in the mood of quick snack and some drinks on Barcelona, this is the place we always think of! Due to English speaking staffs, this place is always full of tourists, but there are more locals enjoying food and chat! Its pan con tomate is a must item, Best in Barcelona!! "
4493,21-02-2013 ,5.0,"We were lucky enough to find this place on tripadvisor just before leaving for a Christmas break. The first night we arrived, there was quite a wait to sit inside, but we were seated quite quickly at an outside table. The food was spectacular, some of the best I have ever had anywhere in Europe. I couldn't stop eating. We knew this couldn't be a one time visit, so we went 3 times in 4 days!The only downside is that the season specials menu is only written in Catalan. While I understand basic Spanish, it was difficult to decipher. The friendly server the first night helped us translate, but the other 2 nights, we were left to guess and order. I would strongly recommend reservations so you don't end up disappointed."
4494,20-02-2013 ,5.0,"In short, yes it is!In more detail:1. Food: amazing quality - their table turnover is such that you will never be served tapas that were cooked longer than 5 minutes before they arrived at your table. Excellent home-made taste, and you must try the following: - Croquetas de pollo y jamón: chicken and ham croquettes. Absolutely deliciously creamy and tasty. A must! - Pimiento relleno de bacalao: red pepper filled with a cod purée and covered with grated cheese. Lovely! - Roscón de la casa: for dessert you absolutely must order this. It is a delicious sponge cake, drowned in a little bit of alcohol and covered with rich crema catalana (egg-based cream... typical of the region... similar to creme brulee).2. Drinks: all sorts of beer (national and imported), wine, champage - You will be spoiled for choice!3. Atmosphere: it depends on the time of the day you eat there! For lunch and dinner during the week you will find many business people getting together after work. On the weekends you will see locals having drinks... And all around it's also full of tourists. However, if you eat slightly late lunches and early dinners you will always find a nice table. Their terrace just outside on the pavement is quite nice!4. Prices: not cheap, by Spanish standards. You will spend around 20 euros per person for a good lunch, including dessert, fresh orange juice and coffee. So it is about double what you'd pay for a ""menu"" anywhere else... However, by international standards this is a steal! Lovely place to go so don't miss it.Any questions just ask me! I reply ... Usually within a few hours. And if I'm on holidays it could take me a few days... Cheers! "
4495,19-02-2013 ,4.0,"Our favorite meal in Barcelona. The tapas here are phenomenal. Enjoyed the simple, classic ambiance as well. Can't wait to go back. We went with our 5 & 7 YO at the time. They still talk about the delicious tapas we had there. "
4496,18-02-2013 ,1.0,"All we were trying to do was get information so we could visit this restaurant, but the man answering the phone was just so rude. He hung up on me the first time after I asked if they took reservations, and I had to call back to get the rest of my questions answered and it was obvious he was impatient that I had the gall to call back to ask a second question! I suspect their popularity has gone to their head or he just shouldn't be dealing with the public. After that, I have no desire to visit them."
4497,18-02-2013 ,4.0,"We headed to Cerveceria Catalana on a busy Friday night in February after reading the rave reviews on TripAdvisor. We must have got there just in time (around 7.30pm), as while the place was packed when we arrived, and we did have to wait 5 or so minutes to get a table, when we left the line was out the street!The place is massive, so it's a good sign when there are hundreds of seats but not enough room for everyone who wants to eat there. We found the menus a bit intimiating as there is A LOT on it, so it was hard to know where to start. Our waiter sensed our confusion and more or less told us what to order - this was great in a way, as it was a relief not to have to try to figure out everything, but I also felt like we were a bit rushed and dictated to, as when we questioned anything he sort of overruled us and made a decision for us. This was even more evident when we (eventually) ordered dessert and one of us didn't pick what he suggested - the waiter rolled his eyes and walked away without comment!To his credit, the food that the waiter chose for us, was all pretty good, and was out on our table within minutes (it seemed) of being ordered. The second waiter who actually brought the food out to us did so with ""no love"" as we called it (i.e. food dumped in the middle of the table without introduction, comment or a smile, and plates were whipped away the moment they were empty, sometimes from underneath you and when there was still a little bit of food left to eat!). She also questioned us when we told her she'd given us the wrong order, only taking it away when our original waiter overheard and came and confirmed that we were right, and she was wrong. Also, it felt a bit like McDonalds, with the staff keen to get us in and out as quickly as possible. That being said, if you stood your ground and took your time (like we did) there's no one forcing you to leave, so you'll be ok. It's just the vibe that's not so pleasant and hard to ignore.In all we were glad we went, as the food was great, fresh and tasty, and very reasonably priced. I'd go there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice of places (see my other reviews for my favourite Barcelona spots!). If you do go there, get the Huevos Rotos (I think!) - or ""Spanish Broken Eggs"". Think french fries with a little bit of spice, sea salt and olive oil, with an egg over the top which is sort of mixed through. Bizarre, though very simple, (to me, probably not to Spanish people!) but SO delicious!"
4498,17-02-2013 ,5.0,"We arrived about 9pm and was told there would be a 15/20 minute wait for a table. We waited outside because the bar area was so busy it seemed unlikely we would find a space to get a drink, within about 10 minutes a waiter came to fetch us and proceeded to lead us through the masses of people to a large table around the corner. The place was busy, the atmosphere buzzing, I don't normally like places too busy this it was a delight to behold. We ordered (or rather we asked our Catalonian colleague to order for us) and within minutes we were treated to plate after plate of fantastic food. Drinks flowed, more food ordered and we spend a good couple of hours enjoyed this great restaurant. I'd recommend this place to anyone who visits Barcelona."
4499,15-02-2013 ,5.0,"The tapas are simple (eg. french fries mixed with fried eggs; mini-baguette with foie gras and roquefort), but they are so well executed they just taste absolutely delicious. Service is flawless. It's great value. No wonder even on a week night, you may have to wait for up to 1 hour, but it's well worth it, and you can have a drink while waiting."
4500,15-02-2013 ,5.0,"Arrived around 14:00, and was told there would be a 20min wait, but then was seated after 5 min (possibly couldve been because i was on crutches). My wife and I ordered a variety of tapas and cured meats, and all excelled! All in all an excellent lunch!"
4501,15-02-2013 ,5.0,"Given that Barcelona has so many great places to eat and I was only there for five days I tried to avoid eating at the same place more than once however failed utterly with this restaurant as my daughter and I visited 3 times!Situated quite near to our b&b it also offered convenience but the main draw was the fantastic and value-for-money food. A really bustling place (there can sometimes be queues!) it's easy to see why it's so popular - really affordable, really fresh and lovely small plates of food. Picking your own seafood from the bar with it in front of you was a highlight, as well as the obligatory pinxtos of course.There are two seating arrangements - the bar at the front and the restaurant at the back. I didn't ever venture in to the latter (it seemed a bit darker with less atmosphere than the front) but we picked the bar twice as well as one lunch visit where we sat on a table outside.Amazing food, atmosphere and price. Go!"

4503,11-02-2013 ,5.0,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the food here, great value for money and very tasty!!! Staff were very friendly and helpful we will definitely be returning on our next trip to Barcelona!! :)"
4504,9-02-2013 ,5.0,"Excellent location, great service, and quality food. Had the gambas (shrimp), patatas bravas (potato cubes fried with mayo and spicy sauce on top), pork strip, and creme caramel. Lovely buzzing atmosphere, with a great mix of locals and tourists. English menu available, but daily specials were in Spanish so just ask them to explain to you what it is. Well recommended."
4505,8-02-2013 ,5.0,"This restaurant came highly recommended to me while traveling on a crusie ship. Having spent my honeymoon in Barcelona over 25 years ago all I could think about was the delicous ham we had every day. While talking to a couple from Holland, they told me this restaurant had the jamon and the tapas I would be looking for.I don't believe that they accept reservations, so when we arrived at 9 pm and were told it would be at least an hour wait I never thought that we would actually make it! (My 86 year old dad was with us)The place is very busy, and crowded, but has a very young, energetic vibe. We liked what we saw and decided to wait. We couldn't find a place to sit while waiting so we walked around the corner and sat at a wine bar and had a few glasses of wine while waiting for our table. I am so glad we waited for a table. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. The staff was extremely helpful to us as we didn't know what to order or how to order. As we would see dishes being served to other tables we would grab a waiter and ask him to bring it to us. Don't forget to have the french fries (papas fritas) with the fried or poached eggs. How in the world does something so simple taste so delicious?!! The shrimp on a stick definitely a must to order but OMG the jamon was the best we had while in Barcelona. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!The people of Barcelona eat late, so don't be surprised to see people either just arriving or waiting to eat at 11 pm, even on a week night. If I lived in Barcelona I would be a regular! It's really that good! I can't wait to go back in July!"
4506,8-02-2013 ,5.0,"Absolutely loved this place. Easily the best restaurant I ate at during my week in Barcelona. The ambience is fabulous, the service is good, and the food is fantastic. No reservations, so you'll need a bit of luck to seat a large group. The price is very reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get."
4507,5-02-2013 ,5.0,We were recommended this place by the Receptionist in our Hotel (Granado 83) as it was quite close by. Don't be put off by how busy the place is. We spoke to the Maitre D' upon arrival who arranged for us to have a table outside if we came back in 45 minutes. Food and atmosphere really great and can recommend the 'Homemade Cake' if you can manage dessert!
4508,3-02-2013 ,5.0,"It's a really busy place, check in and get a drink at the bar, while waiting about half an hour you've got plenty of time to decide what to eat. When you're seated the feast begins... choose a few tapas or a mixed platter and a nice bottle of wine and just keep ordering (don't forget to save some room for dessert)."
4509,3-02-2013 ,5.0,"This place has great tapases, and is pretty cheap.We ate 6 tapases and drank 2 drinks for only 36 €!The food is very tasty don't come to barcelona without stopping here…"
4510,2-02-2013 ,5.0,"Traveling alone I did not have to wait too long to sit at the bar, which is better because you can point to all the food in the case in front of you (like a real Japanese sushi bar). I had razor clams, artichoke hearts and a scallop. All incredibly delicious. Will definitely go back there!"
4511,2-02-2013 ,2.0,"I love idea of tapas but honestly quality of shrimp that we had beside of other thing was not good not fresh at all and for all other well...And service was poor, very unfriendly waitress, we ordered mix of tapas and few plates of tapas of day, one of them was Fried squid rings, and the same thing arrived with plate of mixed tapas, her job was to tell us that Fried squid rings comes with mixed tapas and like that we could order something else..."
4512,2-02-2013 ,4.0,"I loved it all the way! From the ""on-their- toes"" quick service, to the dellicious sea food palette. I think it stands out in Barcelona"
4513,31-01-2013 ,5.0,"You will have to wait...but just do it! It's a great tapas place, very friendly service. Everything is good. Bravas,romana squid, croquet as de jamon,pimientos de padron e una copa de vino rosado...trust me this place will make you smile :-))))"
4514,28-01-2013 ,5.0,"I have been to a number of tapas restaurants in Barcelona with a broad variety of style - if you want to have a quality experience when it comes to both the food, drink and environment this is a wonderful spot. Just go there!"
4515,28-01-2013 ,5.0,"This place is amazing! You can find a really nice atmosphere and service. The tapas are really good and the bread too (they make crisp bread and they put tomato and oil on top, very tasty). Try also the desserts, ""crema catalana"" was pretty good, and the other one was a cake with cream and strawberry, delicious. The wine was savoury"
4516,27-01-2013 ,2.0,"to be honest we do not understand the hype around this place. tourists just fly into the restaurant as it is advertised a lot and a lot ( quite old ) tourist guides. there are many better tapas bars in barcelona, now they may not be as central between the shopping streets as this one and a bit harder to find as mainly locals go there, but its worth it! you will find much better tapas for better prices and especially better service. this place may have been great years ago but not anymore. the waiters know that it doesnt matter what service they deliver as people are tourists and wont come more often than one or twice a year if even.search online for tapas bars or ask locals where they go and you will enjoy a much nicer experience and better food, without waiting for an hour to get a table and end up disappointed. especially tourists think that the place must be amazing because there usually is a cue, which is only due to the fact that it is the place that is advertised in the guides. smaller and family owned, ""real"" fresh tapas bars do not advertise as much as they are small and have lots of local clients.i would not recommend the place!"
4517,27-01-2013 ,5.0,Went a couple times for lunch. We were very impressed by the variety of tapas to offer as well as the freshness and display. Price was reasonable as well.
4518,23-01-2013 ,4.0,"Ate there twice and enjoyed both. The varieties of Tapas is immense , you can pick from the menue or go up to the bar and choose. Whatever we ate was excellent, the waiters bring in the plates at their tempo, and every time you discover a new taste. The place was crowded both times with many locals which means its good!!Even the prices are more then reasonable 25 euros per person including food alcohol desserts and coffee is certainly a reasonable price"
4519,23-01-2013 ,5.0,Great place to try Trendy Tapas ! there is a big line up but it worth waiting. Great sea food bar. You could also see the different type of Tapas to order.
4520,23-01-2013 ,1.0,"Horrid. Do not, DO NOT go here. Our service was awful (late, cold dishes, inattention to us, and hurrying us up to leave). The food was similar to their sister restaurant, Ciudat Comtal, just 3 blocks away, but not nearly as good. We ate at both, and would HAPPILY recommend Ciudat Comtal over Cerveceria Catalana. Buyer beware, you CAN do better!!"
4521,21-01-2013 ,5.0,A tapas bar to visit again and again - Don't be afraid if it's very busy and crowded on the bar - people don't stay so long...We enjoyed it a lot! The prices are really fair. We didn't reserve a table - we came at night and enjoyed the bar. Good Cava as well!
4522,21-01-2013 ,4.0,"We wandered here as it was pretty close to our hostel and had great reviews online...but we were still blown away by the freshness and quality of their food. We had the tapas sampler and jamon, which was perfect for two, but YOU MUST TRY THEIR HOMEMADE CAKE. Being back in NY I wish we could have brought loads of it back home, it really is that good. Food is all around good, a definite must try!"
4523,18-01-2013 ,4.0,"I came here because of Anthony Bourdain's recommendation. Little did I know, it is owned by the same people who opened Ciudad Condal!! They have the same exact menu so if this restaurant is on your to do list for Barcelona, then just choose one of the 2 restaurants (I actually think they have a 3rd). We ordered different things this time and you really can't go wrong with any of their dishes. We had the 3 cheese, mini hamburgers, shrimp skewer, and pan with tomato. Everything was good. My favorite dish was probably the sliders though. Good service, good ambiance. It gets crowded so go for the bar if the wait is too long. You'll have to scout out the people who are about to pay for their food and fight for their seats!"
4524,18-01-2013 ,5.0,"The hotel receptionist recommended it. It was near our hotel! As soon i arrived, i was very surprised because it was very crowded! During the time We were waiting for our reservation to be ready, we had a beer and small dishes on the bar! The food had big variety, the taste was great, and the service very good! If i had more days in barcelona, i would definetely visited it again! I recommend it 1000%!!!!!"
4525,16-01-2013 ,4.0,"everyone i know has told me that this place is the best Tapas bar in Barcelona. So, i went there during my first day in Barcelona. The atmosphere is very different from the usual Tapas bar that we find in Madrid or even in Barcelona. Here's is more refined (and a little expensive too than the other places i mentioned). Anyway, if you want to sit and have refined Tapas, here's the place. The service here is pretty good and there's a lot of options with seafood."
4526,15-01-2013 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by our hotel, which was on the same street. The girl said it will not be crowded. This was about 5 PM. We walked by it and it wasn't crowded; we decided we would eat there later. When we returned about 7 PM there were no tables available and people standing everywhere, so wefound another restaurant nearby and returned for breakfast the next day. It was a good recomendation."
4527,14-01-2013 ,5.0,After a lot of discussing and looking at Trip Advisor we decided to try this tapas bar. Man was it worth it. Great prices but also incredible food. We were with Spanish friends who are foodies and they were also amazed. Iberico ham so tasty and tender it did melt in your mouth.They had an egg and potato dish topped with Foie Gras that was one of the best dishes we have had in the world and cost about US$ 6 and could serve 4 of us. It was so good we ordered another.Only disappointment was the squid which was tasty but a little tough.Service was just outstanding as well.It does get crowded but I'd say worth the wait.
4528,14-01-2013 ,4.0,"Our first tapas here in Barcelona and food was nice and seafood were overall fresh, bit sandy at times but was a nice welcome. Octopus was super tender; prawns were of good size & tasty; fried little fish were the best!"
4529,14-01-2013 ,4.0,Nice spot for an informal dinner or start the night with some tapas. I loved the paderos peppers. I wasn't crazy about the menus in several different languages b/c I felt you got pegged as a tourist if you ordered off of the English one. 
4530,11-01-2013 ,5.0,My partner and I dined here in Feb 2012 on our Euro trip.It was amazing!!! The most memorable place in Barcelona for us. We do love food though.We loved it so much we went back again.Try as many items a you can. THE CROQUETTES OMG!!!I would return to Spain just to eat here again.
4531,11-01-2013 ,4.0,Good food and place but I had to wait long time...the waiting list was too long and you have to wait on outside.
4532,10-01-2013 ,4.0,"The place is very crowded and there is no way to make a reservation. Anyway, you can put your name on the list and came back after 40 min, or you can try to find a place at the bar (for quick tapas meal). The food was very good, tasty and typical for Barcelona. You can try some of many beers (because the restaurant is ""cerveceria"" - means pub) , or you can choose some great wine or sangria! Place is pretty busy and service could be better, but food is worth of queuing for!Bon apetit!"
4533,10-01-2013 ,5.0,Everything has been said below and i can only agree...! Just a little hint for those who don't want to wait in queue before starting their tapas degustation.. Arrive before the locals..! For lunch before 1.15pm and for dinner before 8.45pm
4534,9-01-2013 ,5.0,Every single one of the tapas that we tried was simply delicious! It is a perfect spot either for lunch or dinner on a day of exploring Barcelona. This place is quite popular so be prepared to wait.
4535,7-01-2013 ,5.0,"Service, Quality and Price. The place is always packed and for good reason. It can be noisy and a little chaotic but that just adds to the ambience. The turnaround is quick so the tapas is guaranteed to be fresh. Tourists and locals fill this place up. If you can get in you'll enjoy it."
4536,7-01-2013 ,5.0,"Our guide in Barcelona took us here and ordered for us. Here are some of our favorites: Cuatro Quesos, Langosti, Huevos cabreaos, Alcachofas, pimientos de padron, and jamon jabugo. With 8 of us sharing we had a great variety and a very fair price. It seemed the place was full of local business people at lunch and not especially touristy in its downtown locale. (Our guide had a table for us so we are not sure of the reservation system)"
4537,6-01-2013 ,5.0,"We came here four times in two days, three times for tapas and once for breakfast. It's absolutely worth the wait, you can have a drink while waiting (of the really good vino tinto de la casa, for instance) and they work hard and with a very efficient team to serve or seat you as quickly as possible. They offer a wide range of delicious tapas. We had quite a number of them and they were all really tasty and fresh. Must be one of the best tapas places in Barcelona, I'm sure!"
4538,6-01-2013 ,5.0,Love this place!! Good quality and price!Check out the specials- mushroom season is my favourite time of the year-montadito mar y montaña... yummyAlways packed so make sure to count in 30mins waiting for a table-- but its definatly worth it!
4539,5-01-2013 ,5.0,"This place is mobbed with tourists. They don't take reservations and the wait for a table at lunch or dinner can exceed one hour. However, the food really is quite good. This was without doubt the best tapas restaurant we visited during our week long trip to Spain. Every one of the large variety of dishes we tried was fresh and tasty. We opted to visit Cerveceria Catalana for brunch one day a few minutes prior to 11 am and were seated immediately. I would suggest visiting this place at odd hours, unless you are willing to face a large crowd and a long wait."
4540,4-01-2013 ,4.0,"After the hassle of getting in (we were there at a very popular hour on a Sunday) we were treated to some wonderful and varied food. Very well priced and all the classics were well represented as well as some creative additions. My only complaint is that the service felt very rushed, almost like they are trying to push you out the door. As long as you take your time and stand your ground, this is not an issue, but it may be offputting to some. We had a fantastic meal and I wil I was there right now!"
4541,3-01-2013 ,3.0,"We came early and were seated right away, but right under halogen lights so we got quite hot! Our neighbours were close and the room was noisy, but the service was prompt, if not particularly friendly. We tried the mixed tapas plate and then had a look round at what other people were eating and ordered what we liked the look of. Our beer and wine by the glass was fine and the food was good but not spectacular.It was a good tapas experience, but the food came very quickly and we felt a bit pressurized to get a move on. A nice place to go for a quick bite, but not if you want to linger over your meal."
4542,2-01-2013 ,5.0,"For sure one of the best tapas place in Barcelona. It can take 20 or 30 minutes to get a table but it is worth the wait. Very nice and casual atmosphere, family like, and some of the best tapas I have had in Barcelona. "
4543,28-12-2012 ,5.0,"Best value in Barcelona! Be warned, restaurant does not accept reservations and is always busy! but worth the wait. While you wait, watch the food come out of the kitchen and the tapas bar. Something for everybody, meat lovers and vegetarians both enjoyed their dinners."
4544,28-12-2012 ,4.0,You always have something good when going to Cerveceria Catalana. I highly recommend sitting in the bar where you can see a lot of the fresh tapas on the menu that day and be inspired to order!
4545,26-12-2012 ,3.0,"This tapas place is very popular with locals - nice decor, seems like a trendy place for 20/30's year olds. They have bar/stand area with a sit-down restaurant area on the other side - and a very small patio area in the front. Walked by numerous times in the evening and there was always a line. very crowded in the bar area. A bit noisy. When I finally went, the wait time was 40 minutes. The food was good, but not significantly better than numerous other tapas places in the area. Definitely not worth a 40 minute wait."
4546,24-12-2012 ,5.0,"We stumbled on this restaurant while winding our way back to our hotel from a visit to the nearby aquarium. Our visit didn't start especially well - we were seated fairly quickly, but when - 15 minutes later - we still had not been approached by waitstaff, I started to get a bit worried. After walking up to the bar and catching the attention of one of the staff in the back room behind the bar, I asked if we could please order some drinks. He proceeded to glare at me, glare at the room around me, and then glare at what I thought was a table of customers in a different part of the room, but was actually all of the waitstaff in the restaurant at the time, eating dinner. His glare was somehow magically picked up by the waitstaff at the table nearly instantly, and one of them jumped up and ran over to us, apologizing profusely. Ok, fair enough - maybe an internal miscommunication on their part. I decided to let that one go and see how things turned out.From there on, it was an impeccable experience all around. The waiter was extremely helpful, talking us through the highlights of the menu, pointing out dishes we might like to try (and happily not just the most expensive items) and even giving us a bit of background on some of the dishes. We settled on beef carpaccio and monkfish carpaccio as our starters, which were both great- the monkfish bordering on exceptional. For a main I had a wonderfully cooked entrecote with a really nice peppercorn sauce. My son had spaghetti carbonara, which he loved, and my wife had a beautifully done seafood salad.The atmosphere of the restaurant was likewise excellent. Lots of dark wood, dark red carpeting, a nice view onto the pedestrian passing outside, and a bit of christmas decoration all contributed to the comfortable, yet somehow elegant surroundings. For our first dinner in Barcelona we were thrilled. Finding such reasonably priced, yet excellent food by accident was a great start to our trip, and we will be back to this restaurant when we visit Barcelona again."
4547,23-12-2012 ,3.0,"i dined here in April 2012 and i enjoyed the food very much. So this time, I brought my family there during our December 2012 holidays 2 consecutive days. The good is always very good ( make sure you try the cabreaos eggs style, fried camembert cheese and shrimps on stick ) but the 2nd day we were there, the restaurant was full so we sat around the bar first while waiting for our table turn. The person at the bar called ""Rasty"" really spoilt our dinner. My husband ordered draft beer and he served him bottled beer. Then he gave us a menu card in Spanish and we told him we dont understand Spanish, he rudely replied that there is nothing unique there and all tapas are the same. so we saw this little casserole of mushroom on bar counter and ordered that . He practically slammed the casserole on the table with 4 serving plates and muttered in Spanish to other Spanish customers saying something about Singaporeans (thinking we were Singaporeans) ! And when our table was called, he again slammed the bill and demanded that we pay us before we move to the table. This is the worst service we have ever encountered during our 12 days trip all over Spain and this person is from Phillipines ( an Asian just like us)! we felt so discriminated that we complaint to the lady who managed the reservation and immediately she asked us to fill up the complaint form. Apparently, we were not the only one who got this bad service. We noticed that Madrid and Barcelona employed many Phillipinoes and we would have felt that as Asians, they shouldnt discriminate against fellow Asians! Catalana serve one of the best food in Barcelona but it is a big shame , the service spoilt the good memories I had of this restaurant. if you are going to visit this restaurant, avoid sitting around the bar counter. the service on the table is much better as there are more waiters and waitresses options for service"
4548,17-12-2012 ,5.0,"We came here for dinner and we are very fortunate to get our seats in less than 5mins. We ordered about 7 tapas in total and all of them are amazing good (and the price is really reasonable!). The waiter who served us was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Even though my wife and I will only be on Barcelona for another day, we are considering to head back again tomorrow !"
4549,17-12-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant is the same as Cuitat Comtal a few streets away.This is not a bad thing at all, the food, service and environment are magnificent.I am only mentioning this because if, like me, you have 4 days in Barcelona and are looking for as much variety as possible, only go to one of these two.When I say the same I mean identical menus and courses. They are clearly run by the same person.Having said that, you should definitely go to one of them. They are both outstanding."
4550,16-12-2012 ,5.0,"Either get there early or make reservations. Delish! The best tapas in Barcelona. Sangria is to die for as well. Definitely get the patatas bravas, the shrimp and crab salad. Those were our favorites. There is outdoor seating which would be ideal because it is a tad loud inside. You must make a stop by this place if in Barcelona."
4551,16-12-2012 ,5.0,"Excellent place for local atmosphere and excellent tapas. I recommend ""Cabreaos"" Eggs Style - not to be missed. Went there twice - reasonably priced."
4552,14-12-2012 ,5.0,We had an excellent tapas lunch on the sidewalk. Nice variations and fast service. Reasonable prices. We enjoyed it very much.
4553,13-12-2012 ,3.0,"We have been to this place before and we were always very happy with the food and service. This time we were disappointed unfortunately. We went there for a dinner and as expected we waited for about 40 min to get a table. The waiter took order for drinks and came back very quickly to take a food order, but we just started reading the meny. He was there 3 times during 2 minutes asking “ready to order”?. It was very stressful – we could not read and decide what we want – everything had to be very quickly – this is very unpleasant. After ordering, the food came very fast – good food, but again, almost everything came at the same time and we always had a feeling that we should eat quickly before everything gets cold. They forgot one of our orders but we decided just to drop it. We did not want any dessert and just wanted to go some other place as soon as possible. I would go to this place again but for breakfast only."
4554,13-12-2012 ,4.0,"If you want to try tapas, it´s one of the best places to go. But to sincerely enjoy your meal, you should come at the time that is not typical to have lunch or dinner to avoid queues."
4555,12-12-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us and we liked it so much we visited it three times. If we'd had more time in Barcelona we would have visited more. It's a very popular restaurant judging by the packed house each time we went. Whereas sometimes going to a restaurant in Spain at 11:30 am you are the only patrons, going to Catalana at 11:30 am might get you at seat right away but, any later, you will have to wait. It's very close to both the Gaudi house and the Gaudi apartments so it's very handy if you are visiting these sites and you should. There is such a variety of little plates here that in three visits we still had many items we didn't get to. My favorite was the tiny crispy fish - fantastic. Service was excellent. I tried to describe one dish we had seen on a previous visit and the server took me to the front of the restaurant where they have lots of dishes on display. I didn't see it but, after I described it more thoroughly, the server remarked, ""Oh, we don't have that today."" So, not only do you have lots to choose from, there are some dishes that rotate which means we could have gone there more times without repitition.It's very modern looking with comfortable seating. Good choice of wines also."
4556,12-12-2012 ,5.0,"If it’s the first time you want to visit this restaurant and you don’t exactly know where it is, here is one tip: You can recognize it by the long waiting line in front of the restaurant. This immediately sets the target for the rest of your time… a lot of people want to eat here!The average waiting time if is about 40min for inside seating and 1 hour for terrace, advance reservation is not possible. You need to go inside and get your name listed, most people go for a drink in the nearby bars and come back after 35min. Biggest part of the visitors are locals, but since more and more people are using the internet or apps like ‘Tripadvisor’ (in which they score really high) there are some tourists.So… how is the food? In the six times that I’ve been there I ate so many tapas that I can’t remember them all. The best thing to do is just point at 5-6 random tapas (depending on the amount of people your are with) and you will probably like all of them. It’s also funny to look around and see what other people are eating, does it look good? Ok, just order it at one of the many waiters working there. They work really fast, waiting time for food is just a couple of minutes. Because of the huge amount of customers they sometimes feel a bit pushy and that might be a bit uncomfortable… well I like fast service so I don’t blame them!So if you happen to be in Barcelona and love to taste different things, this place is a great one to go. If you want to get the best table and great service than I suggest you to go during non-peak times. Nevertheless, you will have a great dinner!-- Cerveceria Catalana is located in Carrer de Mallorca (286), near Rambla de Catalunya. The opening times and dates vary: Mo-friday from 08.00-01.30 and in the weekend from 09.00-01.30. --"
4557,12-12-2012 ,5.0,Great variety of typical Spanish tapas. Good value/price ratio. Need to be prepared to wait for a table.
4558,10-12-2012 ,4.0,"Spending a weekend in Barcelona with friends, we ended up twice here. The first time on a Friday evening rather spontaneously. The next day we came here after the Barcelona game. On both days we arrived about 22.30 and it was very busy. You can sit outside (few seats) or sit inside, where they have much more tables. You have to wait though for a free table. You can give your name to the hostess and she will call you, when they have a table for you. We haven't done that. We prefer to stand at the bar (they have two on eachside of the entrance, see picture). When you are lucky you can sit at the bar, but usually you stand. You still have enough room to eat and drink, although sometimes it seems you`ll have to have 3 hands. But you`ll manage it somehow. The food varies from vegi to meat to seafood and it`s excellent and fresh made and they serve you fast. But if you don't like crowds you either wait for a table or you leave. I found it crowded sometimes and that didn't made me feel at ease to stay and enjoy the food & drinks, but when you have a little space it's a must go place to experience tapas."
4559,9-12-2012 ,5.0,"Over 1500 reviews?What's the use to keep writing about a place with those review numbers?BUT.... This place is one of the best and we have tried other places in Barcelona though it will take over a lifetime to visit many of the tapas restaurants in this city.We went back again and again to Catalana on this tripOrder the huevos estrellados as a starter with your first drink...a plate of crispy mini chip fries with two sunny side up eggs broken and mixed in while you watch. The best we have had.Atmosphere, drinks, service and great tapas. A must when in Barcelona.Go early, seat at the counter bar or be prepared to wait !!!!!"
4560,7-12-2012 ,5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal! Great service, amazing food and really, really good sangria. I enjoyed my experience 100%."
4561,5-12-2012 ,4.0,"Excellent service, great food, even if you are not a seafruit fan, like me. The only fault I found is that the menu of the day isnot translated to English, but the waiter was very helpful. A must stop, when in Barcelona. "
4562,4-12-2012 ,5.0,Try and get here early so you can grab a seat at the bar and don't be afraid to ask what dishes are if you don't recognise them. It always seems busy here and given we sat outside in December is a testament to the quality on offer. Not to be missed!
4563,3-12-2012 ,4.0,"For tapas this is the place to go. An extensive main menu plus daily specials. Fried or grilled fish and seafood varieties as well. All very tasty. Full of locals; no tourists. Very very busy but service works well. We went there for lunch so don't know evening atmosphere; that is, can you leisurely enjoy your food and wine? Very good value for money."
4564,1-12-2012 ,5.0,"If you go at spanish peek hours for lunch or dinner, you will have to wait but if you go at 12:30 for lunch and at 7:30 for dinner or earlier, you should not have problem."
4565,29-11-2012 ,5.0,"Best value in Barcelona! Be warned, restaurant does not accept reservations and is always crowded, but worth the wait. While you wait, watch the food come out of the kitchen and the tapas bar. Something for everything, meat lovers and vegetarians both enjoyed their dinners."
4566,28-11-2012 ,5.0,cheap but super delicious tapas bar in barcelona with perfect location. in this place you can have great but cheap tapas. must write here in you must-eat list.
4567,27-11-2012 ,1.0,"First, nice fancy place...Second, the food was the worst we had on our trip (value and taste). Third, go here: Quimet i Quimet (I promise you will love). Fourth, our waiter tried to give us the wrong change (this changed my rating from 2 or maaaaybe 3 to a 1). Enjoy Barcelona!!! "
4568,27-11-2012 ,3.0,"After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and watching the crowd that gathered here I was expecting more of this place, the food turned out to be just OK certainly not the fireworks I was expecting. 1.5 hour wait was to much, the staff wasn't as friendly as in other restaurants of the area, prices where average to high, the decoration of the restaurant and the ambiance was very good. In overall I would say this is barely a 3."
4569,26-11-2012 ,5.0,It's not the first time we go there! You get a good attention and enjoy so many nice and delicious tapas that you always have another one for next time! Prices are alright and location easy to access.
4570,26-11-2012 ,1.0,"I must not have had the proper address for this place because I did not eat at the same restaurant as 800+ other reviewers. This was by far the worst meal we had on our trip to Barcelona. Perhaps we were biased after having some of the most amazing food on our previous days, but I doubt it. We started with the assorted salads, hoping for some of the amazing veggies that the city has to offer. Instead we ended up with a plate of about seven different mayonnaise based salads. It would have been fine, but they were worse than anything I could get at the supermarket deli back in the States. I honestly can't even remember what else we got, we ended up eating so little of it. If you do insist that you must go, avoid the foie gras sandwich. We literally had them take it back just to get it off the table because the look of it was stomach turning. Thank god the meal was relatively inexpensive."
4571,25-11-2012 ,4.0,"We had a delicious (and cheap!) dinner here for two. The tapas were fresh and all of a very high quality, the wine menu was priced very reasonably, and the atmosphere was fun! Arriving early gives you a better shot at a table, but it is a fun place to hang out while you wait!"
4572,25-11-2012 ,2.0,"One of my friend from Spain suggested me to go there.I was not impressed. They offer standard tapas, nothing special. Croquetas tasted only of potato and oil, where was the ham?? squids were really oily, the cheese was cut in super thin slises. The best of all was the tortilla, i can make frittata at home! Everything was super oily..."
4573,22-11-2012 ,4.0,This place is as good as all of the reviews that go before this one.....arrived just before 20:00 on a Tuesday evening and it was just in time as within 15 minutes it looked like someone had delivered a coach party to try and get a table!Of course it's too early for any locals so its nearly all visitors to Barcelona but that in no way detracts from the great atmosphere that there is here....price wise it's not the cheapest but neither is it the most expensive. Two of us ate a really good selection of tapas with a couple of beers and a bottle of wine and it was less than 60 euros all in!Next time I am in Barcelona I will be going back for sure...
4574,22-11-2012 ,5.0,"the tapas restaurant is crowded but worth the wait. patatas bravas are amongst the best. we also enjoyed the serrano ham, large portion of manchego cheese, fresh razor clams washed down by a jug of sangira"
4575,22-11-2012 ,5.0,"Food: Good combination of tapas staples, nothing was particularly original but it was all done well and arrived fast. Highlights were the hot veal steaks and the fried small fishes.Service: Rushed, but in a good way as the servers were obviously used to this.Overall: Go for good tapas in a fun vibrant atmosphere. Seating is based on a waiting list with your name called out when the table is ready, after 8pm time for a table increases significantly. At 8:15 we got 30mins for a 4 person table but it was up to 100mins for a 2 person table by the time we were seated. (120Euro for 4 people, 10 dishes, dessert, sangria)"
4576,19-11-2012 ,5.0,"Good selection of tapas, very tasty. Very popular and lots of people. You can eat at the bar counter too. Convenient location near plenty of shops."
4577,19-11-2012 ,4.0,"Been there 3 times this week, only because of the food. The service is not equal to the food. But the food is really the best tapas in town. Would recommend to all of the tapas seekers to stop here. Come early or wait in line! "
4578,18-11-2012 ,4.0,"We read the reviews about this place on TripAdvisor and had shortlisted it as one of the restaurants to visit during our trip. We were not disappointed and dined there twice during our trip. In fact, we were first brought there by a friend who lives in Barcelona and he recommended this place too. We visited during lunch both times and we went early so we hardly had to queue. The food was delicious. We had the mini burgers, steak pinchos, mushrooms, potato bravas, Spanish omelette, cheese plate, jamon plate and so on. Everything was good and we especially loved the small fried fishes. They were very crispy and highly addictive! Service was efficient and most staff could understand English so we had no problem ordering. We sat at a table and ordered from a menu. The restaurant also has a bar counter where customers could sit and order directly from the dishes displayed at the counter. I think this is a good place to visit for some tapas and prices are reasonable."
4579,17-11-2012 ,5.0,"My husband and I have been to Barcelona several times and (unfortunately) never tuned into the tapas scene. Such a shame because we were missing out big time. While we know there are many good tapas places, this one was recommended to us (as we now understand from the other comments on TA) and we'll probably never go to any other because this one is so completely satisfying in every way - we eat lunch early and were able to nab seats at the bar (recommended) within 10 minutes and put our lunch in the very able and amiable hands of theserver. The foie and apple was divine, the mini fillet of steak the most delectable piece of meat Ican remember - everything really, really good and the bill with 2 glasses of wine and a beer cameout to under 50 euros. We went a second time and found equal satisfaction and we shall go yet again!"
4580,16-11-2012 ,5.0,"Excellent food, the prices are reasonable. the service is correct. Yes there is a queue but enough bar in the vicinity to keep you waiting!"
4581,15-11-2012 ,4.0,"Great food. The Spanish Omelet, Potato Bravo and Cured Ham stood out. The price was reasonable.The wait was over an hour. If you don't mind drinking while you wait (i don't) then it is okay. it was obvious that some were jumping you on the waiting list because of a bribe or special treatment. Started of with a bad taste but the food made up for it."
4582,15-11-2012 ,5.0,"My wife and I orederd around 10 dishes and one singeria, got to 40 euro, which is fair. Every dish was great - greek salad, california salad, mini hamburger, mini sausage, fries and mixed mushrooms with asperagos. Liked every one of them! and the service was fast. Highly recommended. "
4583,14-11-2012 ,5.0,"Food is great, service was very good and friendly.Waiters knows English and the atmosphere is very niceGo and enjoy"
4584,13-11-2012 ,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant, very busy for a reason but when at you seat staff are very attentive and food was great and very reasonably priced"
4585,12-11-2012 ,5.0,"Very busy restuarant. Try to sit at the bar. Delicious food made from the freshest ingredients, wonderfully presented, and washed down with the best sangria. "
4586,12-11-2012 ,4.0,"had a nice lunch here and its price like really worth it, nice atmosfere and fresh food, worth the try!"
4587,10-11-2012 ,5.0,"I fell in love with this place. I came here few years ago on my first trip to Bcn and decided to come back during my last trip! all my expectations (based on my memories)were met!the food, the atmosphere, the people everything is top rataed here.must try if you are looking for a cozy place where you wan to eat well.try among the dozens of tapas available but also remember to ask for the day plates!!! But attention....you will always want more and eventually get addicted. remember that no resercations are possible, so as soon as you get there give your name at the ledies and have patience. but don't worry the standing will be worth it.enjoy"
4588,9-11-2012 ,5.0,"We didn't have a thing that wasn't excellent and we ate a lot! Fried baby squids - the priciest thing we got at 9E and absolutely perfect! Gotta love the fried green peppers, too. Grilled asparagus and mushrooms - just the right touch. Crispy camembert - yummy. Grilled pork loin and roquefort sandwich - tons of flavor. Black & white sausage with mushrooms - what a delicacy. All that and 2 cervezas, 35E. We'll go back again and try some other things - there were just too many to get to. It was too much food and we were starving when we arrived. There are two waiting lines, one for inside, one for outside. We put our name on both: got a table outside in 20 minutes; it would have been 45 outside - at 3pm on a Friday. This came recommended by one of our guides; it was probably 1/2 locals, many at business lunches."
4589,7-11-2012 ,5.0,Although you might find yourself waiting an hour for a table in a very busy waiting area. It is sure worth the wait. The sangria is awesome. The food especially the fried Camembert is so yummy. The calamari rings were the only dish that I wouldn't recommend. Desserts were also great especially the Catalan creme. Yum
4590,7-11-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant has the most amazing tapas I have ever had. My wife and I tried 14 or 15 tapas and each one was better than the last. There was not a single thing we did not enjoy. No other tapas restaurant I have been to comes even close to the selection, quality and taste that this place has to offer. I cant wait to go back again."
4591,6-11-2012 ,4.0,"Went over WE and was told that we needed to wait at least 1 hr to get a table, so we decided to skip it, but we noticed the food and it really gave us the want of trying again...So tonight we arrived and the lady told us there would be a 40min wait. We added our name to the list and... 5 mins later she asked if we minded sitting outside. So we did and since it is very difficult to understand the dishes on the menu (even if thy have an English version), so best is you get your table number from waiter and you go inside and look at the tapas and indicate what you want and give table number... Anyways this place is great, food is great and service is very friendly. We paid €24 per person and consider prices ver reasonable. A must in Barcelona...but try go early o avoid waiting..."
4592,6-11-2012 ,4.0,"It is NOT the best tapas bar in town but it is the place to mingle with both the locals and tourists alike. To avoid the agonizing wait, do come early. 8 pm, that is :) I do NOT recommend the tapas menu at the table. There are more selections for tapas at bar and the fantastic experience to order what appears to tantalize your palate. In addition, the price is more reasonable. Tapas at bar offer far better value.What to order: Padró peppers, tuna-stuffed red peppers, sautéed mushrooms and baconLocation: b/w Rambla de Catalunya and Balmes Metro stop: Passeig de Gracia orDiagonal"
4593,6-11-2012 ,5.0,"I really enjoyed this Tapas. It was located 20 seconds from our hotel and its the ONLY place we went to twice! The service was great from the waiters and although it was very very busy at times, (especially in the late evenings) we were always seated within 10-15 mins. In the summer evenings, you really dont mind standing outside in the cool Spanish air. The food was great, the prices were great, staff were great. "
4594,6-11-2012 ,5.0,"Just amazing food , everything is tasty and deliciousJust grab a sit by the bar and order the menu you won’t regret itthe crowd in front of this restaurant as of 5pm is unbelievable and probably reflects the excellent food presented"
4595,5-11-2012 ,3.0,I think this really isn't the high-end tapas restaurant it used to be. The waiting times are now just silly. 
4596,3-11-2012 ,5.0,"Crowded - book table in advance. The food is delicious. Our waiter was very friendly with our kids, and suggested food they liked. Have been here three times, and urge to go back!"
4597,2-11-2012 ,5.0,"Probably best tapas I had in Barcelona.Most of staff also speak English which helps.Veal was really good, as were prawn skewers."
4598,2-11-2012 ,4.0,"Always busy - a good sign. First rate choice of tapas and, while not dear, not cheap either. Beer, at over 6 Euros for a pint/half litre, is a bit of a rip-off (but other places nearby charge similarly, without the A1 tapas to with it)Service is very good - friendly and efficient.Food quality is first class - fresh, hot and very morish.Be prepared to queue if you feel you want to visit - we got in very quickkly about 6.00pm on a Sunday."
4599,31-10-2012 ,4.0,"Go there if you are ready to wait for 45 minutes. Nice tapas good fast service, you can go to its brother if this one say you have to wait for an hour. (Ciudad Condal) Same taste."
4600,30-10-2012 ,5.0,"We had dinner at early friday evening. The place is nearly packed, but we got our table in a minute. It is just 2 blocks away from Passeig de Gracia. You can plan it after your day for Gaudi house projects and shopping at Passeig de Gracia. We enjoyed great tapas, lively atmosphere, attentive staffs there after our exploration at Monsterrat.A male safe waited for our table, I asked him for recommendation. we ordered as he recommended and he keeps coming back to ensure we like the dishes. How lovely!This restaurant is good for family, couple, friends, even mother and daughter like us."
4601,28-10-2012 ,4.0,"This is a great restaurante for families, couples,friends or just to hang around and have a glass fo wine by yourself. I love the atmosphere and the food is delicious. Hands down the best restaurant(specially for tapas) in spain. Wine by the glass or by the bottle at greap prices as well as the food. its well worth your money, i assure you wont regret it."
4602,28-10-2012 ,5.0,"First look at the daily specials. Grilled seasonal mushrooms were heavenly, and the duck liver with apples was divine. Grilled shrimp skewers we would have had again for dessert if we were not interested in the Catalan cream."
4603,28-10-2012 ,5.0,"This by far was the best, most authentic meal we had in Barcelona. The place is deceitfully huge inside and jam packed with locals for a Sunday lunch. The sangria, about â¬8 for half a pitcher is stellar! We ordered the variety of tapas and then had plates of jamon iberico and cheeses that were so fresh and outstanding. The service was personable and our waiter was so patient an friendly, offering suggestions. Will definitely go back!"
4604,26-10-2012 ,4.0,Really enjoyed this place-- got there around 6pm for a light snack and cava. Ended up eating enough for dinner! Delicious and fun. Tried to go back around 8:30 on another evening and the place was absolutely mobbed so we had to miss it. Worth a visit if you can get there before the crowds.
4605,25-10-2012 ,5.0,"When I was thinking of Barcelona I imagined the food they serve here. Clean, creative and beautiful. The place was always packed so we would have gone more but it was well worth sitting at the bar and having tapas."
4606,25-10-2012 ,5.0,Recommended by the Hotel Murmuri and they were right. This tapas restaurant is great. We went many a night and was pleased each time. Sit at the tapas bar and experience the best Barcelona has to offer. Ask your neighbor at the bar for food ideas - there is so much to choose from.
4607,24-10-2012 ,5.0,"Well located close to paseo de gracia has a veriety of traditional and nouvell cousine tapas that is worth going. hipe atmosphere and excellent service.Good to go with frinds, at noon or at night."
4608,23-10-2012 ,5.0,The best tapas in Barcelona! We absolutely loved this restaurant. Only negative was the 45 minute wait but thats because it was a friday night. The food is amaing and great value for money. I cant wait to go back to Barcelona just to eat at ths restaurant.
4609,23-10-2012 ,5.0,"I think we got lucky. We arrived at 130pm for lunch, table for four, and found the service extremely friendly. Beer was great, food was extraordinary (dont bypass their version of patatas braves with straw like potatoes, fried eggs, loads of garlic...amazing!). So glad we went via recommendation of Casa Camper."
4610,23-10-2012 ,5.0,"We loved this place so much we ate lunch there two days in a row. Unless you arrive very early you will definitely have a wait, between 15 minutes and an hour, but it's worth it. Reasonable prices for Barcelona, and the daily tapas offerings are very imaginative. Of all the food we had there was just one item I wouldn't recommend - the ""California salad"" which wasn't great. Food and drinks service was fast and friendly, we never felt rushed and really enjoyed the experience.Favourite was the baby squid Andalucian style, yummy! There are also some tables outside which are great for atmosphere."
4611,22-10-2012 ,5.0,"Fine food, great service, reasonable prices. What more could you ask for? When we showed up at 9:30 they told us there would be an hour wait. Five minutes later we had a prime table. Go figure. Delicious shrimp on skewers, veal, crispy Camembert on a stick, desserts...."
4612,22-10-2012 ,5.0,"Recommended by our hotel we found this Tapas restaurant to be very good. Always busy, usually with a queue, we waited 20 minutes but happy to do so as the food was very good. Whilst waiting you can see the food at the bar which helps when you come to order. There is a specials Tapas menu for the day, sadly not in English so ordering was a mystery tour that thankfully worked out OK. Would certainly go back to next time in Barca."
4613,22-10-2012 ,3.0,"We got there and were told it would be an hour wait. Met some very nice people at the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine with them. We got our table in 35 minutes, which was great. Ordered wine and were asked for our food order twice before it came. We had a mix of tapas, of which was all very good but especially the veal. Unfortunately, they pressed us so hard to order quickly and brought the food so fast that we really didn't have time to enjoy dinner. It was a great disappointment."
4614,22-10-2012 ,4.0,"While its busy, loud, and can be a bit of a wait to find a table, it's well worth it for the food. This restaurant was recommended by a friend, and did not disappoint. Very good tapas. We ordered: razor clams, potato braves, cabreaos eggs style, grilled pork loin with cheese, jabugo cured ham. All were very tasty! With 5 glasses of wine, total bill came out to approx 45 euros. "
4615,21-10-2012 ,5.0,"Fantastic mouth watering tapas in a great location. The best part you can hear each other and sit at nice tables, but the bar is fun too. A few tables outside as well."
4616,21-10-2012 ,3.0,"Great selection of tapas but there was definitely something wrong with the salmon. The only one in our group who didn't eat the salmon was the only one who wasn't dreadfully sick within hours of finishing the meal. Hostess did a great job managing to get tables within a half hour wait but table staff were quite unfriendly. Other than this, this place lives up its good reviews but I'd strongly encourage them to review food handling procedures with their kitchen staff."
4617,21-10-2012 ,2.0,"We went there on our last evening in Barcelona and were disappointed.We had to wait for over an hour. We saw people pass before us because they gave ""something"" to the person taking the reservations...The we were seated and did not get any explanation so we ordered what we knew. So we missed out on the good tapas (saw them at a table next to us).If you're going in group and with some Spanish people : could be great. But we didn't really enjoy our meal...I prefered other restaurants in Barcelona."
4618,20-10-2012 ,5.0,"Amazing food, always fresh, great service…It is always busy so it is recommended to arrive just before 19:00 for dinner, this way you can get a table.If you arrive later you will have to wait (can be an hour…),.Great experience very time!!!"
4619,20-10-2012 ,5.0,"This place is done justice by the rave reviews. Crowded by a happy mix of locals and tourists, it serves great tapas with an emphasis on sea food. The food was fresh, tasty, satisfying and together with very reasonably priced wine was extremely good value for money. Come early, be prepared for a long wait, and enjoy. Very highly recommended."
4620,20-10-2012 ,5.0,"This place was amazing. Best tapas we've ever had in a great setting. I haven't been in a couple years, but I'm writing this review so I don't have to keep looking up the name whenever I recommend it!"
4621,20-10-2012 ,5.0,"Great food and very lively. Lots of daily specials, good choice of food and wine. It is VERY popular, at 7:30pm on a Monday the wait for a table was already 60 minutes. Drop by there, put your name on the list and then go shopping or take a stroll."
4622,19-10-2012 ,5.0,"I traveled from Fountain Hills, Arizona to Barcelona to celebrate a milestone birthday on October 16th and truly created a moment to remember by eating here. It's hard to make a choice because of all the lovely tapas dishes that cover the bar from its beginning at the door all the way back to the table area. The cerveceria is a clean, immaculate slick design, where the food is the star. I could talk about everything on the menu, but you can also see that for yourself. Things I found particularly delicious were the 'must have' deep fried almond encrusted camembert on a skewer with pure raspberry jam down top and the veal sirloin filet style on a baguette toast point with deep fried jalapeno pepper skewered on top and rock sea salt dusted all over. Both were outstanding. Not wanting to mask tasting, I opted for perrier to keep flavors pure and it was certainly the right choice. Desserts include whiskey pudding, cream catalan, hot lava choc cake, etc.. Tapas allows you to try several smaller portions which is what tapas is all about. Portions are perfect; Price is perfect. Experience with the exceptional food was so good that I literally did not want to eat or drink for several hours because nothing I would take later would be as good. Remarkable experience. This is definitely a must visit. Wish I would have been able to stay in barcelona longer so I could have come back a second time. BIG 5 STARS!"
4623,19-10-2012 ,5.0,"First tried this place the day we arrived in Barcelona on reccomendation of our hotel. 2nd visit I got chatting to a lady who lives on Barcelona who confirmed this is the best tapas in town. Highly reccomended, try and save room for desert if you can!"
4624,19-10-2012 ,3.0,"Modern interior and tasty tapas. Veal sirloin is excellent. If you are unsure about tapas, try the tapas selection @ â¬15.50 (fried prawns, venus clams, salted green peppers, ham and cheese croquettes and mini asparagus spears and mushrooms). Mini hamburgers and hot dogs were also good. Tapas dinner for 4 with drinks came to â¬58. Service was fast and attentive but somehow the place lacked any charm."
4625,19-10-2012 ,5.0,"Catalana is a very popular, busy restaurant and its easy to understand why. The food, drinks and service are outstanding and the prices are fabulous for the standard you receive. Most recommended."
4626,19-10-2012 ,5.0,"I fell in love with this place - and being just a 1 minute walk from our hotel we went several times. The food is good, it is reasonably priced and the atmostphere is great. Well worth a visit"
4627,18-10-2012 ,5.0,Busy!! Must wait in line to be seated but well worth the wait. Outstanding selection of tapas!! From traditional to nouvelle. Enjoyed the food and the ambiance. Highly recommended.
4628,18-10-2012 ,5.0,"Our flight arrived in Barcelona at 9:30 a.m.local time and by the time we got to the hotel, checked in and offed our bags it was time for a snack. Our front desk directed us a block and a half down the road to what we later found out was the best tapas in the city. Yes, it got busy in there. There is often a reason why restaurants get busy and in this case it was because the food is good and the prices are reasonable. We drank some house wine and cold Estrella and an large assortment of tapas including from jamon to sardines and we liked it all. We at and drank like it was a fiesta and left ready for a siesta. I suggest sitting in the bar if possible so that you can see (or point to) what you are ordering. At least take a good, hard look at the tapas on the way to your table."
4629,18-10-2012 ,5.0,"We have spent a wonderful evening here sitting on the bar. In fact, it was so good we decided to return the next day (during lunch time, seating out side) and once again - enjoyed every minute. Food was great! Dishes were creative and not over priced. The atmosphere was fantastic (music is playing but you can hear yourself).We would defiantly return a third time if and when we get a chance. Three tips: 1. Arrive early as reservations are not being taken and this place enjoyes extremely high popularity; or - be prepared to wait in line. 2. While waiting, try their Cava Mojito. 3. As the menu is so extensive, don't hesitate to consult the staff. We found the staff to be attentive and keen to assist."
4630,17-10-2012 ,4.0,"Although this place seems to be popular with tourists and somewhat of a scene the food is quite good and reasonably priced.I stopped by for a late lunch and ordered a lomo sandwhich, patatas bravas, and sauteed squid. Everything was fresh an excellent. Not a destination restaurant, but definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.At night this place is super packed with mostly tourists and can be very sceney."
4631,16-10-2012 ,5.0,"There is no better way to dine informally and well than by eating at a great tapas bar. This one fills the bill. The variety is extraordinary. From avocado salads to Iberian Salumi; ""white anchovies"" in olive oil, cured in sherry vinegar to figs stuffed with goat cheese and topped with Serrano ham.Sitting at the bar is an ideal way to go if language is a problem because all you need to do is point.This place is often packed at the bar and the tables that fill a large interior.The best tip I received was to go early. Since it is the custom to eat late in Barcelona, going early should be easy for most Americans.Skip the Sangria and have some cave or beer on tap...and please say hi to Gregory, who took such good care of us at the bar on two successive nights."
4632,15-10-2012 ,4.0,"We went to Catalana at lunchtime. It was very busy and we were predicted a 30 minute wait. One of our party needed to sit down and the waiter found him a chair while we were waiting. In the event, we got a table outside very quickly and enjoyed a lunch of a mixed tapas plate plus a spanish omelette for 4 of us. Food arrived promptly and was excellent and reasonably priced. Definitely worth a visit."
4633,13-10-2012 ,5.0,"Kept looking in when we passed by to and from our hotel - always busy. Went along at 7.15 on a Thursday and waited 40 minutes on the list for an inside table - very efficient, as was the waitress. Probably could have sat down at the bar more or less straight away. I ordered the mixed tapas for €16 and it was better value than I expected - five items including prawns in shell, fried calamari, croquettes and shellfish. OH chose fried whitebait, amongst other thing,s from the daily choices and everything was delicious. Had creme brulee for dessert, which was also good, and we were surprised to find that the bill, with a couple of beers, only came to €42"
4634,12-10-2012 ,5.0,"We had lunch here and though we were initially told we would have to wait 15-20min, we were seated pretty much straight away. The food we ordered arrived very quickly too. This is not fast food though - the food was fresh, very well presented and delicious. I prefer Cerveceria Catalana to it's sister restaurant Ciudad Contal which is a bit outdated and dirty."
4635,11-10-2012 ,5.0,"We ate here twice during our trip after a personal recommendation, the food was delicious and the atmospher was buzzing. Really busy place but we were seated and served quickly which was surprising given the huge crowds of people. The veal was tremendous a must try! You know it's good when the locals eat here."
4636,11-10-2012 ,4.0,"We went there mid-week around 17:00 and started with an assorted tapas plate. It was OK nothing more. It was 5 tapas ( as shown in the pic) with the same potatoes - nice a bit too salty, small fried fishes - my partner said their good, i felt they were over fried, scallops- always hated those, boiled shrimps- boaringly boiled, and the best one - surprisingly was green fried peppers with sea salt that was excellent!We ordered extra; fried calamari rings - excellent maid but boaringly sereved . An two weirdly sereved sandwiches that was describe with foua gra and Swedish broscata. Food is properly made, by high-end chef but maybe because of the over promising I felt a bit of a disappointment "
4637,11-10-2012 ,5.0,"You'll know you've reached it when you see the crowd spilling out on the sidewalk. It's crowded, crazy, energetic and the food is fantastic. They have everything you'd expect (tortilla espanola, croquetas, pa amb tomaquet, jamon iberico) plus specials listed on the chalk board and all manner of fresh seafood in the cases in front of the bar. I love the crowded, high energy atmosphere you'll find there in the evenings but if that seems off-putting try going for lunch or afternoon snack. On this trip I took a colleague from work - he was absolutely amazed at how tasty everything was."
4638,10-10-2012 ,5.0,"It was a very good choice or late lunch in the city. It wasn't very busy ( 4 p.m.), but the food was great.We sat on the bar and the service was nice. The camembert cheese with raspberry was a must have. Also the pulpitos."
4639,10-10-2012 ,5.0,Awesome. This is the place to see and be seen too. The myriad of tapas makes one wonder if there is an entire think tank team just coming up with hundreds of ideas each day that the chefs get to choose from before finalizing each night's menu.Out of this world octopus!Amazing anchovies!Exciting eggplant!Perfectly deep fried peppers!Crazy good clams!It goes on and on. Go. Wait in line no matter how long and pay what ever they ask. You may never get another chance.
4640,10-10-2012 ,5.0,"Really nice tapas restaurant and bar , fantastic prices , great service , crowded but worth waiting 40 mins for table. Food was great will definately go there again "
4641,9-10-2012 ,5.0,"After reading all the reviews we decided to try the tapas out here. It is definitely the best tapas we have had!Unlike most of the reviewers we didn't have to wait to be seated, service was polite and swift and we were very full! The fried small fish was great, codfish skewers were good but a little translucent for our liking, patatas bravas AMAZING, as were the grilled mushrooms and the veal sirloin.We hope to be back there very soon."
4642,9-10-2012 ,3.0,"We had good Tapas here, but honestly, they were not much different to the tapas we had in a couple of other recommended Tapas Restuarants - I do feel the place is overated. Bottom line, although good, it really is not worth the one hour wait (possibly more) and all the noise, confusion and chaos going on around you whilst you are trying to eat (unless you're into that kind of thing of course)"
4643,8-10-2012 ,4.0,"Went here after a concert at the Palau de la Musica. This place is great. The staff is attentive and helpful. The food is great, fresh, interesting. If you go early enough, you'll have no problem getting seated. Enjoy!"
4644,7-10-2012 ,5.0,"I lived in Barcelona in college for 3 months. Fast foward 10 years and I wanted to eat somewhere nice but not pricy. This fit the bill. FOr about 15 US dollars I ate very well and had 2 glasses of wine. The Patatas Bravas were amazing still dreaming of them. The best pork flauta I will probably ever eat in my life which was so tender and I don't really love pork fyi. I had some tapa with roasted peppers, eggplant with a goat cheese on top...amazing. Tortilla Espanola amazing. I Still can't figure out how they manage to feed all of those people and there were so many locals a good sign in a relatively short time.We ate there 2 times. Once around 7pm and the other night at 9pm. It is very crowded around 9pm. I suggest going earlier if you don't want to wait 45 min and be in crowds. We wanted to come here because we wanted to sit instead of standing for tapas. I had a Ramat wine for 2 US dollars and it was amazing. In fact I wrote the name down and went to the local store and bought the same bottle for 7 Euros. I now LOVE Spanish food in part to this wonderful restaurant a celebration of Spanish food."
4645,6-10-2012 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was recommended by a friends, and we were not disappointed! We love tapas, and we had a great variety of food at a good price. Can't wait to go back to Barcelona so we could go back and eat here!!"
4646,6-10-2012 ,4.0,"Having been disappointed with the tapas in some of the tourist traps in Barcelona, it was nice to discover the Cerveceria Catalana which offers a range of good tapas at modest prices. Would recommend the razor clams and the batas bravas with the eggs; and the jamon was particularly good. The service is quick and efficient. The restaurant can get very crowded at peak times hence best to go early."
4647,5-10-2012 ,4.0,"We went here at 7.30 pm and there was already small line. We had to wait for 15 min but that was no problem for us. The quality of the food is very good. Lots of choice and all very frech. The prices are good compare to other tapas restaurants. Apparently there is another tapas place a few streets closer to plaza cataluny, called Ciudad Comdal, that is the same as this (same owner I think). There are many places but always very crowded. "
4648,4-10-2012 ,4.0,"We ate here on our last night in Barcelona. While it was reasonably priced, we had a few issues. Our razor clams were sandy (the night before, we'd had perfect ones at another restaurant). The baby squid was clearly an inferior product (we'd had some earlier that day, and so had some expectation as to the shape the squid would be in). Other than that, they did a pretty good job of serving basic tapas. It was pretty touristy, and the table next to us turned 3 times while we were eating, which doesn't really make me feel comfortable when I'm on vacation."
4649,4-10-2012 ,5.0,"Be prepared to wait, even at 4PM. The food here is as good as expected with such a wait. Make sure you walk far into the restaurant through the crowds to get your name on the wait list, too. There are a lot of pinxos and tapas, which are all outstanding. The service can take a while, but it's busy! Waiters don't stop to check on things, so you have to flag them down if you want to order more food or when you want something. Going in and knowing that won't leave you disappointed. I'm super glad we found this place, because it was our favorite meal of the trip."
4650,3-10-2012 ,4.0,The food was really well put together and very reasonably priced. 39 euro for full tapas and bottle of wine. However the waiter only came by once to ask for food orders and left us alone for about an hour even though we wanted to order more. Also took about 15 minutes just to remember to bring a desert menu. Good place to enjoy amazing tapas but prepare for subpar service
4651,3-10-2012 ,5.0,went here on the reviews that we saw on trip advisor. when we saw the waiting list thought it must be ggod and such great value!!!!! 2 glasses of wine for under 4 euros.... seafood tapas are fab..
4652,2-10-2012 ,5.0,we loved this place..veal sirloin melted in your mouth.after reading reviews we got there around 7 and only waited 20 minutes and had a drink/pincho at the bar.highly recommend
4653,2-10-2012 ,5.0,"My spouse and I visited Catalana during our recent trip to Barcelona September 7-9. After sampling a number of Tapas restaurants I was getting a little deflated after all, part of the reason for our visiting Barcelona was the ""tapa"". We arrived during a typical dinner hour around 11pm and the place was firing on all cylinders. There was a 45 minute wait, so we scoped out a couple of seats that were opening up at the bar which I prefer as you are in the middle of all the action. We ordered a pitcher of sangria which was perhaps the best I have ever tried. The garlic shrimp floating in olive oil in a terra cotta ramekin was unbelievable. A couple of the reviewers put in a couple of shots of the beef tenderloin tapa which was excellent as well. On the cold side, I tried the anchovie tapa which was quite good. Apart from Sagrada Familia, Park Guel, and some of the other amazing sites, Catalana restored my faith in why I went to Barcelona. Enjoy!!"
4654,2-10-2012 ,4.0,"Excellent selection. Well prepared and presented. Tried the grilled clam, potatoes with spicy sauce and wild grilled mushrooms. Adored all. Clams my favorite."
4655,29-09-2012 ,5.0,"Lots of variety, ate there twice in the week we were in town. We went for an early dinner (6 p.m.) one day and an early lunch (12:30) a few days later and tables were available both inside and out for immediate seating. Don't miss the crispy potatoes with eggs on top, really delicious."
4656,29-09-2012 ,2.0,We went here based on a recommendation from our hotel and the reviews in one word disappointed! It was such a let down compared to the food we have had at the market and the borne district. Not for foodies 
4657,29-09-2012 ,5.0,"This was our last stop after a 9 day trip in Barcelona so we have tried many Spanish restaurants and we have to say that the tapas at this restaurant was great. We went on a very rainy Saturday following the DK guide book's recommendation & walked in the rain for at least 20-30 minutes from Sagrada Familia to find a restaurant packed to the brim with barely any standing room, despite it raining cats and dogs. The waiting list was also really long and I was told when I put my name down at 330pm that the waiting time will be 30-40 minutes. We persevered and got our table just before 4pm. There are two menus, one English menu and one small printed menu in Spanish stuck to the back of a small wine list. I can only assume that to be the specials or chef's suggestions as it was not the same as the English menu. From that menu, we ordered grilled razor clams (very tasty), scallop with cheese (ok), grilled octopus on skewer (ok), cod with honey and aioli (tasty). We also had 1/2 jug of sangria, garlic prawns (the most expensive at €11.75), potatoes bravas, one croquette, and Mallorca sausage with cheese (I liked this). Total bill €56. Not cheap but great place for tapas."
4658,29-09-2012 ,5.0,I went there everyday.. really good tapas restaurant! You can order anything that will be excellent! Hope to come back soon
4659,28-09-2012 ,5.0,"Fantastic experience and well worth the wait. When we arrived and we were told we would have a waiting time of around 1 hour and 15 minutes we wondered whether or not we should wait. So glad we did!!The buzz at this restaurant was amazing, we stood outside and enjoyed some wine while waiting for our table. Before we got allocated our table there were some seats at the bar for tapas so we ordered a few of those while we were waiting which were all excellent.Once seated in the main restaurant we ordered tapas from the menu along with some very good Alvarino wine which was very reasonably priced.The food was very fresh, well cooked and really tasty - plenty of fish as well as meat dishes and some tapas dishes that veggies can eat too.This was a fantastic find and hope it stays as good as it is now for our next visit to Barcelona."
4660,28-09-2012 ,5.0,"The only negative thing is that it's always full of people and you have to wait until there's a free table....but it's definitely worth! Fresh and varied food, excellent service. It's one of the best Tapas Restaurant of the city!"
4661,28-09-2012 ,5.0,"It is one of the best restaurants in Barcelona! It is a place where locals go, so it is not very touristic. There is a great variety of tapas, very delicious but quite expensive, although the food in general in Barcelona is rather expensive. I have tasted both meat seafood and they were marvelous!! Also they have a nice quality of sangria and ""tinto de verano"" (which is a kind of red wine with soda). This place is full from early in the morning until late at night, so it is better to make a reservation. I went at 5p.m without a reservation but fortunately I waited only a few minutes for an available table. The staff was really friendly, they explained everything on the menu which is written in catalan."
4662,27-09-2012 ,4.0,"The first time we went to Catalana, we walked away because it was IMPOSSIBLE to get a table. The next two times, we were there at 4pm and we still had to wait!!The quality of the food is pretty good. All very tastey, but the razor clams were sandy. We liked the mini hamburger, egged with jamon, mini fried fishes. We had mushrooms the first time we ate there which I really liked, but for some reason, the I was less impressed during the second visit (2 years later). Definitely worth a visit if you want to eat at off peak times or are willing to wait."
4663,26-09-2012 ,5.0,"We were in Barcelona for 3 days and we're very happy that we ate here our first night. Our first night, second night and third night. It was so good we ate there for dinner every night. Go earlier in the evening if you don't want to wait long for an outdoor table. If you go later in the evening, expect a long wait for an outdoor table or try to belly-up to the bar if you can find a space. They also have and indoor restaurant area that is very nice and the wait wasn't quite as long as for the outdoor tables. The tapas were excellent and so was the sangria. We had tapas in 4 other cities/towns in Spain during this trip and nothing compares to this restaurant."
4664,26-09-2012 ,5.0,"Once you've had the tapas here, you won't be pleased with tapas elsewhere. They are soooooooooo good. Like, mouthwatering good. Go here for lunch. Go for dinner. And then again the next day. You won't regret it.The wait to get in for dinner is crazy. But it's worth it. Really, really good quality food. They also serve really good white sangria. The prices are incredible for such quality food, and a bargain compared to what you'd have to pay in North America.Great atmosphere too."
4665,26-09-2012 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a MUST see restaurant!! In carrer Mallorca, where nothing much happens, this place is buzzing and if you get there after 8pm, be ready to wait 45min for inside seating and over 1hr for terrace. Neither the less should this be a reason to not go! It simply reflects SPAIN! Peopl on the street, having a few drinks, a chat and a smoke, waiting until someone calls their name! Priceless!! It's loud, the place is Jam packt and you can hardly reach the bar... STILL SOO WORTH IT!!You should try the Huevos Rotos that they serve, the selection of Montaditos was great, the octopus was also really good as well as the 'baked/ Almond coated cheese'...there are simply too many too chose from!Visit BCN and pass by this place!!"
4666,26-09-2012 ,5.0,My girlfriend and I took a trip to Barcelona and stayed for 5 nights. We ate at Cerveceria Catalana 4 nights out of the 5. The menu was large enough where we were able to eat new things every night not to mention the specials that they have on the bar menu. I've never written an Internet review before but this place is well worth the hype and praise it gets and even got me to write this review. Favorite thing we ate was the shrimp skewers absolutely to die for. I would make them my last meal on death row. Like 100 of them.
4667,25-09-2012 ,5.0,"i'm reading through the reviews, anyone rank this place below 3 stars have no clue what they are talking about. This is the best spot in Barcelona, I came back for a second round when i've tried other restuarants in barcelona, totally worth the wait. If you want to get a table, you should arrive by 8pm, if you come any later, the place is lined up with hungry tourists and locals. I would eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, try it for yourself."
4668,25-09-2012 ,5.0,"Recommended by our hotel, went back a second time as well. Big queues so go and put your name down early and then go for a walk"
4669,25-09-2012 ,4.0,"We ate at Cervecia Catalana after walking by for four days and always seeing the restaurant full of people, a great mix of locals and touristas alike. We decided on dinner and arrived at 7:30, we seated immediately. The waitress that served us was friendly and helpful with menu and wine recommendations, at no time did we feel rushed during the meal. The food was wonderful, the seafood was fresh, everything was cooked to order and arrived piping hot. If you wait until 8:30 to 9:00pm the place is packed and you'll have to wait to be seated. So go a little early enjoy freshly cooked Tapas, conversation and some wine, you'll be glad you did."
4670,24-09-2012 ,1.0,"If i had only one word to describe this place it would be: cold. Not just the airconditioning that was freezing, but the way the staff treats the guest. In all the time i have spend in Barcelona i have never had such an unwelcome feeling. We were put at a table in the back with the groups. When asking for another free table we got some lame excuse about that table being suitable for 5 and we were just a party of 3. Lame because our table could easily seat 6 and the other table was given to a party of 4 within 2 min after we set down. The staff kept on rushing us to order, coming back every 30 seconds asking if we were ready to order. The food was thrown on the table as if we were given it for free. And the empty plates were gone so quick, we still had the last bite in our mouth. When leaving we were getting our things together, one of us was still seated when two waiters came running in to clean the table for the next tourist to be treated like cattle. What a terrible place! I felt really sorry to have spend my time and money in such a place. Oh and the food, not bad, but definately not worth the treatment. "
4671,22-09-2012 ,5.0,"French fries mixed with egg and tomatoes was delicious (called ""Cabreaos""). The prices are fine and the food was good."
4672,22-09-2012 ,5.0,"Food, service, price all excellent! You won't go wrong at Catalana. The Servi e is fast and the food is amazing."
4673,20-09-2012 ,4.0,"If you like a fast paced, pumping environment then this is perfect for you. The food is good too (in comparison to most restaurants we have been to in Spain). The waiters are really nothing to rave about, to put it nicely. But it is worth a visit to this restaurant during your stay in Barcelona."
4674,20-09-2012 ,4.0,"We did not have a reservation and was betting our luck at this happening local restaurant. We arrived at 8:30PM and it was jam packed. I was only hoping to score two seats at the bar but we got lucky. We got a table within 20 minutes of waiting. The restaurant is actually very big and the service was pretty fast. I would rather sit at the bar because you can see exactly what fresh seafood tapas they offer today but fortunately, they do have English menu and I took note of the dishes while I was waiting. You need to try their steak slider because they are delicious. Also, don't skip their fries with huevos on top. We did not get it but apparently that was their signature dish and EVERONE else got it at their table! We also tried their fresh boiled sweet prawn and it is amazing and so fresh. They olive oil baby octopus was also delicious. You should try their chorizo or Iberian ham if you haven't because that is a Barcelonian specialty. Finally, I would say get their creme de Catalana. It is our creme brulee but it is so delicious there! Finally, make sure you get a bottle of cava! It is another Barcelona local specialty and it is a great sparking wine!"
4675,19-09-2012 ,5.0,"we went there for a dinner in the pick hours around 20:30 so we had to wait 40 minutes for our table, so we went to a little stroll in the streets around.it was more than worth the wait.every tapas we tried was excellent, the sangria was also excellent.the service was great too.if you are looking for the more elegant tapas bar then this is your place"
4676,19-09-2012 ,5.0,"An amazing place for tapas -- you can tell by how popular this is with the locals. We had a perfect meal: garlic prawns, calamari, sauteed mushrooms, potatoes (aioli sauce is addictive!). For dessert, we couldn't decide between the almond cake and the flan...so we ordered both. (Good move!). This feels like an upscale dining experience, but with a moderate tab (about $25 pp), depending on your wine splurges. Everyone who has been to Barcelona recommended this to us...and they were absolutely spot-on. "
4677,19-09-2012 ,5.0,Recommended by the concierge we arrived fairly early by Spanish standards as you can't book. Wait for tables was about 45 minutes so we managed to get seats at the bar on the seafood side where you can still order everything from the menu including the montaditos from the bar on the opposite side. We had loads of food and a great bottle of albarino for about eur50. 
4678,18-09-2012 ,5.0,"Seriously i didnt have better tapas than in this place. Also sangria is amazing. If you wanna go there during the day (1-4pm) better to do reservation if you don't wanna wait to get table. The stuff is helpful, but all organization is bit stressful, especially if you are choosing tapas directly from bar, they hurry you up so crazy, didnt like that, so i would definitely suggest to seat by the table."
4679,18-09-2012 ,5.0,Excellent food and sangria. Service was fast and attentive. The place was busy but we only had to wait about 30 minutes just after 8. Try the potatoes with the fried egg!
4680,18-09-2012 ,5.0,Tapas were great service was good everything was very fresh. Seated fast even during the busy time. Good recommendations.
4681,18-09-2012 ,5.0,I went to Cerveceria Catalana on my last night in Barcelona. I was on my own so decided to sit in the bar. Before I knew it I was in conversations with people from all over the world. The food was excellent and had it been on my first night I am not sure I would have gone anywhere else...
4682,17-09-2012 ,2.0,"We came on Saturday 17:00 and didn't have to wait. We sat on the bar. Service was bad, we got wrong orders, waited too long and had to remind them we exists. Food was ok, when they served it hot, but nothing special. I would not come back. Maybe the service is better for the tables."
4683,17-09-2012 ,5.0,"Go early, very busy. Great selection of tapas, can choose from the bar or off the menu, Potatoes with egg an d spice were good, loved the sangria, helpful waiters"
4684,15-09-2012 ,5.0,Food and sangria we so tasty - I was speechless. So good it hurts. Will definitely return for more. Cerveceria Catalana is one of the definitions of Barcelona to me.
4685,14-09-2012 ,3.0,"We went inside the restaurant at around 1150am, and the restaurant was pretty empty inside. The waiter looked busy, but I don't know what they are busy with because there are not a lot of customers at the time. The waiter who took care of us looked very arrogant and busy, without any smile. He was clever enough to bring English menu. Basically, we didn't leave any tips for him in the end.We ordered the following for lunch today:1. Assorted Tapas - fried chili, fried anchovies, BBQ shrimp, clamps, very good and fresh.2. Spanish Omlet - egg with potatos3. Bread with tomato4. Sandwich with Foie Gras - the best ever!5. cola lightx2Total costs: 26 euro"
4686,14-09-2012 ,4.0,"It's clearly in a huge number of travel guides and as a result there seems to be a queue no matter what time of day or what day of the week you visit. But it's worth the wait. A vast array of tapas to suit every taste and pocket and waiting staff to talk you through the best ways to enjoy the menu. With an inexpensive wine list, this surprisingly turned out to be one of the best value for money meals we had in Barcelona."
4687,13-09-2012 ,5.0,"We arrived for dinner at about 9.30pm, naively thinking we might have missed the dinner rush, alas no, it was very busy and so we settled for wine and cold beer. When we did sit down, we devoured the tapas and enjoyed a delicious bottle of white wine, whilst chatting to a young Swedish couple right next to us. This Restaurant is part of the same group as Ciudad Comdal (the menus are identical), although the restaurant style and plating is different.We enjoyed the intimate atmosphere, the food was great and service excellent."
4688,12-09-2012 ,4.0,"The name of the restaurant maybe midleasing. ""Cerveceria"" means beerhouse. They have beer allright, but this is more like an upper-scale bar/restaurant. We went twice on the same day - on our last day of 8-day Spain trip.Restaurant is located on a fancy district of Barcelona, a bit remninescent of New York's 5fh av.It's very close to a Diagonal metro station (2-5min walk), and Casa Batllo and Pedrera (casa mila).As you walk into the restaurant, on the left wall, there is a seafood bar (raw sea food). On the right wall, the traditional tapas bar. We toured the Pedrera and in our way to Casa Batllo, we stopped by light lunch. Place was empty, and we sat by the tapas bar. We had a few tapas and Sangria (medium size jar). Both were fantastic. The sangria was rather potent, and made touring Casa Batllo that much more fun.We returned for dinner around 9pm withour reservation. Big mistake. The scene was totally different from lunch time. It was CROWDED with finely dressed locals and tourists. Young couples on date, older couples after event, etc. Place was very lively. Only think missing was a live band. We put in our name on the waiting list (1+ hour wait time), but as we waited we scored a corner of the tapas-bar. Every single square inch was very much sought after. Our corner was standing only, but it was a relief to even have that.We ordered and ate while standing, but it was all fun. We had a few tapas dishes, and we loved it. Was this the best place in Barcelona ? probably not, but it was a good way to end our vacation in Spain. We were too tired to search for new places, and since we'd stopped by at lunch , we returned. No regretes. The seafood tapas are prepared on-demand ( as opposed to tapas premade and displayed on the bar). The bartender will take your order, and then yell to the cook across the wall (where the seadfood bar is). When dishes are made , you'll get them steamy hot. With all the noise, and confusion of multiple order in the bar, the staff does an amazing job of taking your (all) oders and not getting them screwed up. One recurring theme we saw in our 8 days in Spain is that the high-Tripadvisor-reviewed restaurants were crowded both with locals and tourists alike.."
4689,11-09-2012 ,5.0,"Lovely visit around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, place was packed with over 20 people waiting outside, was able to find a spot for two in roughly 5 minutes. Quick service, waiters are nice despite the obvious hurry to serve everyone. Maybe a bit pushy at times when you're done with the meal, asking you if you want something else. Makes one feel a bit uncomfortable to just sit and rest a bit after eating.The food was great though, traditional, spicy, definitely a place to come back to. Desserts are not something extraordinary, a lot of pound cake based sweets, but, hey, I am not a sweets lover to judge.Bill for two including a full meal of tapas, 2 beers each and dessert was a bit over EUR35 (that's about $45) so it's mid class, not expensive, but not exactly the cheapest thing either.Considering the food, the service, and the atmosphere, this place offers a good value for money."
4690,11-09-2012 ,5.0,Our hotel suggested we go here for the dish that has fried eggs over French fries with a spicy sauce. We loved it!
4691,11-09-2012 ,5.0,"We just were in Barcelona for 6 days. Each day we went to a different Tapas restaurant for lunch. The clear winner was this tapas restaurant. Not the usual tourist tapas- but those that Catalans eat. Huge choice of cold, hot, small sandwiches, and desserts. Dont be turned off by the continuous line- you usually get a table in 10 minutes. After this discovery- we wanted to go there everyday."
4692,10-09-2012 ,5.0,"I can't say enough about Cerveceria Catalana -- we went twice in three days, and tried to go a third for a late night drink but it was too crowded! Go early or late to avoid the crowds. Such a neat, varied selection of tapas and salads in a vibrant atmosphere. We loved the mozzarella/tomato salad, the ham/roquefort sandwich, and the flan."
4693,10-09-2012 ,5.0,"We went looking for CC this afternoon to see what it looked like. They were just putting the food out and it looked so fresh and tasty we couldn't resist settling in for an early dinner. Everything we had was delicious, big servings and at a great price. Sangria was wonderful. Will probably go back tomorrow for a farewell dinner! Sadly our last in Barcelona for this holiday!"
4694,10-09-2012 ,3.0,"First the good things:- Clean good looking place- Friendly &/or quick staff especially the "" maître d' ""- Not expensiveBut then:- It's big and hardly any spanish people around. You get a really touristy experience.- you get a change of being put right under the airco while it's 30 deg c. outside. We froze.- the staff is obviously rushed to get people in and out as quickly as possible. Turnover motivated I guess. It was no real relaxed meal.- A random local Pincho's place in Santander made more interesting creative bites than this. The quality was o.k. but no surprises.- The Flan Catalan does not taste like much.- It's really a let down when they slap the hot chocolate cake in the microwave right in front of you, and even more when you find out it's not heated properly.If you are looking for a clean place with some ok tapas and don't mind the rush and lack of spanish vibe, by all means. But I'd look around for something diffrent next time."
4695,9-09-2012 ,5.0,"A lot of people outside and inside the popular restaurant. We were 12 people - 2 groups and wanted 2 tables. The waiter said we need to wait about 45 minutes and longer if we wanted a table outside.During the time we ordered great Capa, beer and wine. In a few minutes we get our tables inside!Professional staff.We asked the waiter for his recommendation about different kind of tapas. He asked what kind of food we liked and if someone was allergical. Then he suggested what we should order.´We all loved what he choosed for us. Absolutely the best tapas we had during this week! Recommend this to everyone."
4696,9-09-2012 ,4.0,"I had the tapas, they were good, but not amazing. However, I feel comfortable with the cleanliness and professionallism in this place. It makes you feel good, and despite the tapas not being the best, the whole experience feels good and makes you want to come back. Choosing this place can't go wrong, and probably a good starting point as the first tapas place to visit in Barcelona. I will definitely be going back."
4697,9-09-2012 ,4.0,"I love Cerveseria Catalana and often recommend it to people visiting - I don't go as often now as it's quite difficult to get in. The food is always fresh and tasty and the service is swift. This is a good place to sample traditional racion- style tapas - look for scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms or young asparagus, depending on season. (revueltos) But everything on the menu is tasty!"
4698,9-09-2012 ,5.0,"We visited Barcelona this summer and a couple of locals recommended this place. Disclaimer: it is so awesome and therefore, it gets reaaaally crowded! So expect to wait in order to be seated if you go during peak times. We had almost all of items on the menu (we were a big group) and I cannot think of one that I did not like. The pimientos rellenos with tuna were ""okay"", but the rest? OMG! The Steak Tapas, the pan con tomate and jamon serrano, the croquetas, the pimientos with salt, and THE CAVA SANGRIA!!! We ate so many tapas that I can't remember all I had. All I can remember is that everything was amazing! So if you happen to be in Barcelona and love to taste different things, this place is a great one to go. Please remember to go during non-peak times to get a good table and great service."
4699,8-09-2012 ,5.0,Although we waited 20 minutes to be seated but the food was good we ordered 5 kinds of tapas and the service was fast
4700,7-09-2012 ,5.0,"Well worthy of is position in the top 50 restaurants in Barcelona, you just have to see the queues, That says it all, full of locals and tourists, we had a 40min wait to sit outside on a Saturday night so not that bad. The food is very very good, and why the last reviewer said the clams and razor clams were expensive is beyond me, what do you want, rancid seafood ?. We had @ 10 dishes 2 jugs of sangia, coffee's and it was a very reasonable 78 euro's."
4701,5-09-2012 ,3.0,"We had a late breakfast, so we came around 4ish for snacks. We opted to be seated at the bar, and ordered a few tapas. The bf got the Fuet and croquettes while i got razor claims, clams and mini clams (don't ask me the names in spanish) and a small bottle of white wine. This came up to be 43 Euros. The clams are fresh but definitely over priced. One of the clams dishes was 11euros for very few clams.....It's good, but was it worth it? Not for me."
4702,4-09-2012 ,3.0,"I would not recommend this place. We did not make reservations so we waited for hour and a half for a table. When we finally got it, the food that arrived was standard and not worth the wait. I have definelty found better tapas place in Barcelona. It is possible that we ordered all the wrong dishes, but what are the chances, I ask you?!. So if after my review you decide to go, make reservations way ahead. This place gets packed."
4703,3-09-2012 ,5.0,"The restaurant was incredibly crowded and we had to wade through crowds of trendy-looking people enjoying a drink at the bar simply to put our name on the list for the equally trendy restaurant. Once we were seated, it was time to chose which tapas we wanted to order, and this task proved incredibly difficult: everything sounded great! To help us decide, we ordered the house sangria which was sweet, light, and refreshing. We finally settled on four tapas and a cheese plate. For starters, our semi-soft manchego cheese plate was just sharp enough to have a nice flavor but not too sharp as to make it unpleasant to nibble on the slices without crackers. Our next dish was one of my favorite: escalavida con fromage chevre. This dish was basically a giant free-formed tart with a round slice of goat cheese on top followed by a layer of marinated grilled red peppers and then a bottom layer of marinated legumes. As I cut the dish, the goat cheese softened into the peppers and veggies, which were marinated with some type of vinegar and sugar before being grilled. The escalavida was a juicy and flavorful combination. Next, we enjoyed a tortilla, which, in Spain, is a potato casserole of sorts. The outside of the casserole was a little tougher...read more at http://godsavethefood.blogspot.com/2011/11/barcelona-mi-nueva-favorita-ciudad.html"
4704,2-09-2012 ,4.0,"The service was excellent, with very fast service, actually almost too fast for my girlfriend who hadn't finished her tapas dish before the waiter took the plate from the table, not stopping even after realising his mistake. Apart from that little hiccup, a very enjoyable experience with a lively buzz. If you're visiting La Pedrera, it is a stone's throw away, and won't be sorry for going."
4705,31-08-2012 ,5.0,"Delicious, great value and quick service. I visited this restuarant a few years ago so decided to head back on a recent trip - it was brilliant! The simply named 'skewered prawns' were the winner for us! Please visit at least once - even if you have to wait 20 minutes for a table, please do - it truly is worth the wait."
4706,31-08-2012 ,4.0,"We went there for Lunch & we had to wait for few minutes to find a table, although we wanted to sit on the Bar in order to choose the Tapas we want. we ended up choosing fro the Menu with the help of the waiter. The food was exceptional & Delicious.If you are in Barcelona, you should go there."
4707,30-08-2012 ,5.0,"Found the Tapas to be excellent. Very reasonable pricewise for what ends up to be a great dinner. One word of caution is to get there early. They supposedly open at 8 PM. The first time we went there was around 9:30 PM and we were told that there was almost a 2 hour wait. Went back the next night a little after 8 PM and only had to wait about 15 minutes. Crowds were already starting to form, even a 8 PM>"
4708,30-08-2012 ,5.0,"Enjoyed all 7 dishes and the inexpensive Rioja. Crowded at 7:40 but got seated in 20 minutes as promised- lots of seating and high turnover. Special mention to cod-stuffed red pepper w./ cheese, asparagus mushroom dish and steak skewer, but it all looked and tasted good. Was even more crowded when we left at 9:00; fun atmosphere."
4709,29-08-2012 ,4.0,"This place was packed the entire evening. We were lucky enough to get a table for 2. I tried to impress the hostess with my Spanish skills only for her to talk to me back in English. Oh well. I guess I smell American. In any event, the food here was great, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the service was relatively quick. We had the sangria and loved every drop. I wouldn't have minded coming back here for a second time."
4710,29-08-2012 ,5.0,every year when my family vists our family in barcelona we have to go at least once to eat tapas here. Always croweded and always good food. Service may not be the best but the food is worth it. Try the sortida or assortment of tapas.
4711,29-08-2012 ,5.0,"Tapas Heaven. Our hotel recommended this restaurant and it was so good we went back twice in 2 nights. Kids loved it. Mom and dad did, too. Mini hamburgers, jamon and mini sirloin were outstanding. Squid, lightly fried, was delicious. Don't miss the sangria. Apparently chocked full of more than just wine and fruit (vodka, rum...yum). Yes, you will wait, but go around 8, put your name on the list, then shop for an hour in the neighborhood. It's well worth it."
4712,27-08-2012 ,3.0,"We tried to go there on saturday and friday night, but was impossible to get a space even to stand up. Too crowd. Fair enough. We finally managed to go on sunday, for a brunch, before leaving to the airport. Bocadillos and coffee very good. The only negative note, waiters were quite rude and not polite."
4713,24-08-2012 ,4.0,"The place is very busy and the staff is kind of rude. Other than that, is the best place we found for tapas. There might be others, but our experience made this place above the other restaurants we tried. Ended up going with 2 different local people without trying, just happened since the first time I did not even looked at the name of the place and the third time I did not know where we were going until we got there. With the immense amount of foreign tourist the quality of restaurant food and service has sadly gone down or it is very expensive. We used to go to Butafumeiro but the prices were really high, one oyster was 6 Euros!"
4714,23-08-2012 ,5.0,"The red shrimp, frois, baby squid, jamon. Just go. Go when you can get in- lunch or early, early dinner. Otherwise, wait it's worth it. Miss this place!"
4715,23-08-2012 ,4.0,"This a tipical tapas bar/restaurant in spain with great choice of tapas, extremelly fresh and tasty.The place is packed which is mandatory for a tapas place and the two counters are vibrating with people in and outThe atmosphere is superbAlthough there was a couple of tapas not cooked to perfection and a couple not that interesting the place deserves a visit if you planning to have tapas in barcelona"
4716,23-08-2012 ,5.0,"We ordered many dishes. We had the small fried fish, squid (which we ordered fried,) shrimp, which were all so tasty, especially with lemon. We also ordered some cold dishes, such as one with smoked, raw looking salmon on buttered bread, one with coleslaw with bits of smoked beef on toast. We also ordered grilled small green peppers with sea salt.It was all amazing and i would recommend to anyone coming to Barcelona.Be sure to gt there before 7pm because then it gets very busy quickly!"
4717,22-08-2012 ,4.0,"Yes, very tasty. Scored a seat at the bar - the guy behind the counter was a bit brusk - but was quick to serve (and hey, when surrounded by demanding tourists every night - might be understandable). I loved the montaditos - since I was at the bar, I would choose a couple, enjoy with my sangria, then choose a couple more, etc. Menu was also available (both in English and Spanish) but I like to enjoy lots of different flavors - so the tapas rock!"
4718,21-08-2012 ,4.0,"This restaurant has a lot of good things going for it...good tapas, very good service, large space with lively atmosphere and nicely designed. The assorted dessert plate was delicious. No reservations are allowed. You can only put your name on a waiting list. We went on a Saturday night and waited more than an hour for a table. Very highly recommended if you can bear the waiting game."
4719,21-08-2012 ,5.0,"You have to book and queue but it was worth it on the whole - the food is very good and the atmosphere buzzing.Service is efficient and the tapas was of a better quality than many places we tried. The only down side I was at a table next to a cupboard with waste bins, which was less than ideal but we had some great food and enjoyed a few beers - the cost is reasonable too."
4720,21-08-2012 ,5.0,"So- this is one of the best ""I need a solid, enjoyable meal and don't want to think too hard or be too artsy"" restaurants in Barcelona. Seriously. Incredibly affordable and incredibly delicious.To me, the ambiance is such that you can go in and speak entirely in your native language, be well treated, and still feel like you're in a Spanish restaurant. This may not hold true to the natives- a Barcelona friend explained to me that he loved the food, but the only reason he didn't go was because it felt touristy. However, since I only lived in the city for four months, this was less of a concern for me. When you go, ask for the daily menu- it has a lot of deliciousness on it, and (if you don't speak Spanish/ Catalan) it's kind of a fun odyssey guessing what might come out. Previously mentioned but definite must hits are the french fries with eggs and the fried Camembert tapas. Yes they sound gross. And yes, they are the most amazingly delicious things you will ever, and I do mean ever, eat.Frequent visitor hint: a lot of the time when you give your name, they'll say 25 minutes. However, since a lot of people wait outside and don't hear their names, if you wait by the bar or host you will almost certainly be seated more quickly. ENJOY."
4721,20-08-2012 ,5.0,"Amazing atmosphere, amazing food! Wait for a space at the bar and eat what you can see. You won't be disappointed."
4722,20-08-2012 ,4.0,"located just at the start of La Rambla, this tapas restaurant is very popular. Choice of tapas as far as reaches the eye, with some excellent ones making up for the rather simple ones... great food, but it comes at a price... I'm sure you can find better value for money in some of the smaller streets just off La Rambla."
4723,20-08-2012 ,5.0,If I would have to decide where to go for tapas in Barcelona I would go here. High quality food and drinks. And you know what is the best?? It is really cheap. A glass of red wine was about 1.8â¬. The best and cheapest tapas I ever had in spain.
4724,19-08-2012 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was recommended to me by a friend and it turned out to be a great recommendation! It was so great that my date and I went there two nights in a row. The restaurant is located in a very popular and posh area off of Las Rablas. We went on Tuesday and Wednesday nights and waited 45 min to an hour each time, so be prepared to wait a bit. I would suggest putting your name in for a table and then heading to a close bar/ restaurant (such as Lizarran for a 70 cent beer and some great montaditos) to hold you over until you get a table. Believe me it is worth the wait!If you don't know Spanish or are not fluent, the host/hostess at Cerveceria Catalana will try to pair you up with a server who has decent English. Try to ask them for their favorite dishes and ask for a translation for the specials of the day. The specials were some of the greatest dishes we tried - like the wild mushroom and cured ham or the canelones stuffed with tuna and covered with bechamel sauce. Yum! On the regular menu, the veal sirloin is cooked to perfection and the assorted montaditos are very scrumptious. Don't forget to end your meal with the hot chocolate cake. It's a chocolate cake with a warm gooey center. Incredible! I am going back to Barcelona in Dec/ Jan and will definitely be stopping at Cerveceria Catalana for a meal (or two!)."
4725,19-08-2012 ,5.0,"This was our third time here, the food was delicious, so much to choose from. friendly staff and great atmosphere. We would highly recommend this restaurant."
4726,18-08-2012 ,3.0,"Huge line up ....to many people. Decor is fine, staff is efficient but its too fast foodish for me .. try to find a smaller place with more authentic food. Lots of the things we ate were fried or tasted all the same. Its a good pick if you are a large group of people cause it is a pretty big place... but get ready to wait at the door. "
4727,18-08-2012 ,4.0,"We've been here a couple of times and altough it's always full, it's worth the waiting.The food is good, very good tapas. The service at the bar was good, in the rstaurant not so much, very busy and in a hurry. The price was fair.Wouldn't miss it if in Barcelona."
4728,16-08-2012 ,4.0,"After reading the reviews I expected something incredible but honestly every meal we've had in Barcelona, trip advisor rated or not, has been great. This was great too but I'm not sure what they hype is about. The atmosphere is nothing special inside I'd rather be eating outside with a view and the service felt very rushed. "
4729,16-08-2012 ,5.0,"I had eaten here a few years ago, and was quite excited when I booked a hotel just minutes away this year. We enjoyed a lunch and a dinner here (both in the outdoor seating area), and the food was superb! The staff was top-notch. Prices weren't as low as other restaurants in Barcelona, but it certainly wasn't overpriced, either. The ""Quatro Quesos"" was fantastic!"
4730,16-08-2012 ,5.0,"A recommendation from our b& b found us siting in great atmosphere but the best was to come.Tapas so fresh n tasty accompanied with excellent service and excellent choice of beveragesValue for money and a great spot away from the touristy avenues in the city.Actually upon reflection it was a tourist attraction with great food ,the diners were from all over the globe ,yes will be back"
4731,15-08-2012 ,4.0,Arrived on Sun 5th August and could have easily been put off by having to wait for a table. Glad we did not move on. Tapas and sangria was excellent. Food was fresh and well prepared. And arrived quick as you would expect with tapas. Best of all we ate for 32 euros!
4732,15-08-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended by the hostel reception where a friend and me were staying and we are glad that we asked. This place is fantastic. We went several times on our 4 day stay in Barcelona. The service is excellent, the atmosphere is excellent and the food is excellent! We had an array of different things, my favourites being the patatas bravas, the croquettes, the anchovy and tuna flauta and the camembert. It was all so good and so cheap. The cheapest red wine was declicious too! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Barcelona!"
4733,14-08-2012 ,5.0,We received recommendation for this restaurant.When we arrived on a Friday evening there was a 30 Min waiting list. we registered and waited...It was worth it!The atmosphere is great!The food is delicious!The service is fast!The prices are reasonable!if you arriving in Barcelona - Don't miss it!
4734,14-08-2012 ,4.0,"This is a tapas style restaurant and I think we were the only english speaking diners! Very busy and lots of atmosphere. The service is excellent and the pricing very good. We had a selection of 4 tapas and were about to order a further two when the waiter said that 4 were enough at least to start with - he was correct, we could have gone and ordered more than we required and wasted money. We had breakfast on the Saturday morning there (spanish style) and again on the Sunday, the waiter remembered us and asked if we would like the same again which we did - didnt even have to look at the menu. There freshly squeezed orange juice is amazing - try and grab a table outside for breakfast."
4735,14-08-2012 ,5.0,"arrived at 8 and only waited half an hour. all the shops are open nearby so you can just have a look around and come back. huge restaurant and completely full, but great quick service, the waitstaff are always there whenever you need anything.delicious affordable tapas, pne of the best we had, would definitely recommend!"
4736,13-08-2012 ,4.0,"We visited Cerveceria Catalana after reading good reviews in Tripadvisor. The place was heavily crowded but we managed to get seats in a short time. I could have given it an excellent rating but I found the tapas at Ciudad Condal better. The place is always crowded and is a favorite with pick pockets. While we were relishing our first tapas experience in Barcelona, we saw a lady crying. Someone had stolen her bag where she kept her ipad, passport, credit cards and cash. So one eye on the tapas, the other eye on your stuff."
4737,13-08-2012 ,5.0,"It's an outstanding tapas restaurant with (very) affordable prices but you have to be early (early like 19h30 - 20h). If you are in couple you don't have to wait too long (30 - 45 minutes) but from the moment you are more than 2 it can be easily 1 to 2 hours. The Friday and Saturday are the busiest days, better chose another day if you can.It's not a ""small typical rustic"" restaurant, it's more like a factory where you don't have to wait long for your eat. But we didn't had the feeling that we were kicked out so make place for other customers.We went two times during our stay and it was every time delicious"
4738,12-08-2012 ,4.0,"Yes it s worth waiting. The menu in t clear to all bit take a look at the counters and peek to other tab,es what tylu can bet. Not too expensive"
4739,11-08-2012 ,4.0,"My husband and i visited this restaurant a few days ago and the place was just packed.But knowing the reviews of how long the wait to get a table on this place, we went there on an off peak time. We got there about 3:00 pm so we manage to get a table after 10mins.We ordered mini burger, patata brava, shrimps in garlic, chicken croquette, grilled green peppers, fried small fish and clams. Everything was just good! The shrimps are amazing!Would definitely visit again when we are back in Barcelona."
4740,10-08-2012 ,4.0,"This was our first stop in Barcelona. Our hotel reccomended it and we are glad they did. We had the spicy potatoes, Spanish omlet, Greek salad and chicken crocket. All was so good. We also had a pitcher of sangria. The sangria was a great start to Spain! "
4741,10-08-2012 ,5.0,"We dined here last night. After arriving at 8pm , there was a long cue. we gave the waitress our name and after about 30 - 40 minutes we were seated. It was definately worth the. This now is our favourite tapas bar in bar / restaurant in Barcelona. The food was fantastic and so creative and well presented. It include all te usual tapas and alot more . There were dishes that i wouldnt have believed possible. This is truly a fantastic dining experience which we will definatley re vist whilst in barcelona."
4742,10-08-2012 ,4.0,Long lines. Beautiful modern comfortable restaurant interior and seating. Downside is that due to high demand they kick you out after 1 hour and 45 minute seatings.
4743,8-08-2012 ,4.0,"Obviously popular, this restaurant at least has a semi-organized queue system. Expect to wait for an hour on a busy night. There is a broad selection of well-prepared tapas - the children especially enjoyed the mini hot dogs. Reasonably good service, not very expensive. The only place in Barcelona we went twice, despite the queue - thumbs up."
4744,8-08-2012 ,5.0,"We read reviews and decided to find this place. It was quite a walk from our hotel but we are glad we made the trek. We went around 6:00 pm on a Saturday night and were seated right away. We had a bottle of rioja and tapas. We loved the camembert crunch, boiled shrimp (with eyes intact), and many other tapas. It was our best meal in Barcelona."
4745,7-08-2012 ,5.0,"We loved the entire experience here ... food, service, atmosphere. We asked the bartender for recommendations and ended up with a spectacular meal. You must try their ""huevos cabreados"", it’s absolutely delicious, we got addicted to them! . The crowds are part of the fun. We will definitely return!"
4746,7-08-2012 ,4.0,"We came here around 10 o'clock in the evening, both bar and restaurant were full full full! So I gave up my name at the receptionist. We sat down at the bar, had a little drink, a little fingerfood and about an hour later (as promised) we got in. So we ordered all kinds of tapas, cuttle fish, patatas bravas, sandwich with ham salad and so on. We both had a glass of wine. The portions were big, and this for a cheap price (going from 3 to 6, 7 euros average). All of it tasted very good and after having asked our bill, we were very surprised to see our bill was no more than 27 euros incl drinks! I would definitely go back, first of all for the atmosphere, the food, the drinks and ofcourse for its price!"
4747,6-08-2012 ,4.0,"Very popular tapas place, fresh and tasty, had a nice rioja by the glass and sat at a bar so we didnt have to wait. friendly waiter. seems popular with locals and tourists. casual busy place. good value."
4748,6-08-2012 ,5.0,"We went to this restaurant twice during our Barcelona trip. I would recommend coming here at lease once as overall, it was lovely on all levels. The choice of tapas is great and delicious too! It was very busy on both occasions so be prepared to wait and had a mixture of tourists and locals."
4749,6-08-2012 ,4.0,"A nice place that feels full of local people, with a large choice of tapas at average prices, good fast service. Can't say the taste was the best ever but the atmosphere was nice and worth the waiting time of 40 min.I could recommend this place to anyone but expect good and not excellent."
4750,5-08-2012 ,4.0,"Very popular restaurant, very good tapas, the food is similar to the one in ciutat comtal, they are both ""a must"" to eat good Tapas in Barcelona."
4751,5-08-2012 ,5.0,"A must go if your ever in Barcelona! This restaurant was recommended to us by the receptionist at our hotel and it was so good we went back there three times to take our friends. The restaurant has a great vibe with a good crowd. Its full all the time and its one of the few restaurants open till 1 or 2 am in the area. The food is ridiculously good, especially the Cabreos! which is basically fries with a secret red sauce and fried eggs on top. It tastes a lot better than Im making it sound. Also recommended are the green peppers and the potato bravas. But to be honest everything we had there was reallly good!"
4752,5-08-2012 ,5.0,"Delicious tapas, salads, seafood. Fried camembert and crem-brulee are great! Fast service(optionally you can ask your table number from waiter and choose everything you want from the bar directly, waiter will bring your order) Be ready to wait for place in the evening!"
4753,5-08-2012 ,5.0,Great food... Great service.... Yes a bit of a wait... But well worth it.... The montadito de solomillo is amazing!!! Asare the calamares....
4754,5-08-2012 ,5.0,"We tried getting into Cerveceria Catalana on 2 prior occasions during our stay, until we realized our best chances would be to arrive around normal US dinner hours of 7:30 PM instead of Barcelona dining time of 9 PM and later. Even at that early hour, the place was packed. Our server was patient and helpful and thankfully spoke enough English to assist us in choosing a selection of tapas we thoroughly enjoyed. Even the pitcher of Sangria was a standout! Everything that made its way to our table was fresh, tasty & delicious. Highly recommended and would definitely return."
4755,4-08-2012 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana remains a must-visit while in Barcelona. Tapas are excellent and reasonably priced, and good for either a meal or a mid-day or late night break."
4756,2-08-2012 ,4.0,"This is a very popular place to have tapas, lots of tourists, so expect to wait for a table or have to stand in the crowded bar, but the wait is worth while. The food was delicious."
4757,2-08-2012 ,5.0,"All the tapas that I tasted were really good. Eventhough the place was busy ,the waiting time worthed for the value of the food. If I go back to Barcelona , I would like to visit again!"
4758,1-08-2012 ,4.0,"Fast service, worth the wait..English speaking , good size portion tapes, on the money sangria, all summs up to a good value..."
4759,1-08-2012 ,4.0,"The food here is good, not the best we had in Barcelona though. The restaurant is very busy so if you turn up after 9pm expect to wait. However, I noted that the times they seem to give to people are unrealistic, everyone gets told 1 hour, we made sure we waited and got a table within 20 minutes. A lot of people put their names down and then leave. You do feel slightly rushed, which is a shame. But all in all if you have not been before I would recommend going."
4760,31-07-2012 ,5.0,"Following the recommendation of staff at our hotel we tried this restaurant for lunch on our first day and ended up returning twice more, including for our last dinner of our visit in Barcelona. The tapas are just ridiculously good, it is hard to know what to suggest but consider huevos cabreaos, which means ""angry eggs"" in Catalan. They are soft poached eggs over shoestring frenchfries with a mildly hot red pepper sauce. Hard to describe but don't miss! The olives, white anchovies, toasted breads with sushi style salmon, fried clams.... Best to sit at the bar and you can point to what you want to try, and see what others are getting too! A large selection with wine for two was less than 30 euros. It was more or less busy on all visits but you may be seated sooner if you sit at the bar. Menu was available in Spanish and English as well as Catalan. "
4761,30-07-2012 ,5.0,"excelent food for great prices. come early as its always busy, sometimes you need to wait up to 1h to get a tabel. no reservation possible... but its worth it!!"
4762,30-07-2012 ,5.0,The prawns were excellent! The crusted cheese with a sweet sauce is devine. everything on the menu is different and very tasty. teh place is always packed so make reservations!
4763,30-07-2012 ,5.0,"This place is crowded from 5 pm till closing. But the atmosphere is worth the wait (actually no need to wait as long as you can find a place to put your drink down). The tapas is great but not excellent. The left side is mostly fresh seafood (beats Asia) and the right side is vegetable and meat (or even from the menu). Desert bar is at the back - try the Catalan milk custard. You can order from both sides by shouting it out. We prefer the bar than sit down and do not go during the daytime (we did once). The food is not as fresh since the traffic slowed down. Listen to the chef (?) in charge of the bar. Their recommendations are good and don't forget the beer - inexpensive and good. After all, the name means Catalan Brewery."
4764,29-07-2012 ,4.0,"I have visited this place every time, I have been in Barcelona. All tables are occupied most of the time, but give the waiter your name and wait. It is worth waiting for. They make wonderful tapas - you have to try the fried artichokes."
4765,28-07-2012 ,4.0,"Hard to justify the lengthy wait at this super popular spot, but once we got our table, we really enjoyed our experience at Cerveceria Catalana. "
4766,27-07-2012 ,5.0,"I’m tempted to say “don’t go here” because this place is already a little hard for me to get into the way it is, but that wouldn’t be fair. Located a few blocks north of Placa Catalunya, this largish tapas place may have an excellent reputation among tourists and the tourist guides, but that is no doubt because the tapas are outstanding, the value is relatively good and the ambiance, once you get a table, it's is very agreeable, both inside and outside.The main reason I write now is to point out that, every time we go there, the estimated wait time is far longer than the actual wait turns out to be. The reason is that a lot of people apparently give up and leave before their names are called. For example, last week we were told “over an hour,” and yet we were seated and ordering within about 20 minutes. Many people's names were called and nobody answered, and so the waiter went on to the next. There are no guarantees, of course, but my advice is: don’t give up. A little patience is well worth it."
4767,26-07-2012 ,4.0,"A handsome restaurant with a great vibe. We went for a tapas lunch. Expect to wait if you arrive past 1pm. Service was a bit spotty due to the crowd, but overall this is a very good option for those looking for a nice tapas lunch. It's not on Las Ramblas, but it's close to Plaza Catalunya which is the heart of Barcelona."
4768,26-07-2012 ,5.0,"We have read about place being busy but decided to have a go. Arrived just after 6pm and we were lucky to get a table outside as half an hour later we would be waiting like others.we have ordered 9 tapas and bottle of nice ocava and paid only €43!! Food was fantastic, all fresh and well nd seasoned. Service is really polite, giving sufficient attention and with good english, deserving a good tip! We liked it so much that we came back the day after and ordered 10 tapas again and better bottle of cava and paid €55 which was really worth it! I think we will come back tonight again :)oh and forgot to mention I am a vegetarian and as you can imagine Spanish couisine is not really veggie friendly but this place had definitely plenty of choice for everyone!"
4769,23-07-2012 ,3.0,"We arrived early-ish Saturday evening. No queue. Choice of tables. The waiters buzz around and place dishes as they arrive, which gives an efficient service in terms of delivery but not when the original (never to be seen again) waiter takes an incorrect order..Food is OK. Service is efficient (but lacks any sense of personality as the waiter keeps changing). Atmosphere is OK but it all seems slightly anodyne. Best in Barcelona? It can't possibly be. Worth queuing for? No. Good once you're there? Yes."
4770,22-07-2012 ,5.0,"Yelp suggested this restaurant. When we got there at 3PM, we were told 45 minutes wait. They weren't kidding. So, we gave our name and waited. Glad we did. The tapas was imaginative and very tasty. Good mini hamburguesa, patatas bravas. Ate a hearty lunch of 4 waters and 9 tapas for 54 Euro."
4771,21-07-2012 ,5.0,"The food was so great that we went once for lunch and once for dinner...If you really want to experience it to its fullest, don't sit at a table...sit at the bar where all the action is. You can choose with your eyes but make sure to ask for the tapas of the day menu since there are always some gems on it. Food was consistent, beer was cold. Sodas come in very small mini bottles that barely fill a wine glass. Stay with the wine and beer...get there before 1 for lunch and before 9 for dinner if you want to beat the crowd. Otherwise expect a long wait...but it really is worth it!"
4772,20-07-2012 ,5.0,"Had to wait about 45 min but enjoyed the people watching. Food was great, highly recommended."
4773,20-07-2012 ,4.0,"The place is nice, food is good and not too expensive.You probably will have to wait 30mins-1h to get a table."
4774,19-07-2012 ,4.0,"Popular restaurant with attentive waiters fluent in english and Spanish. Affordable tapas, and international range of beer, though typical selection. Waitress very helpful, prompt but not rushed service. Would recommend. "
4775,19-07-2012 ,4.0,"This was a recommendation from a foodie friend and it didn't disappoint. It is a good sign that it is always full and even more so when a lot of the customers are locals and not just tourists. I went on successive evenings. Sat at the bar first time, and at a table the following nights. A terrific variety of good quality tapas, some of them quite adventurous. The first evening my server told me I had ordered too much (I had) which adds to my trust in the place."
4776,19-07-2012 ,5.0,"through the years this place never changed the great quality and taste of food. I really really reccomend the escalivada tibia con queso de cabra, the famous jamon serrano, the truta de patatas and.. sangria with red wine, of course!You can have a special meal just for 15-20 euro, and, if you consider that having dinner along the rambla payibg the same even if food is often horrible over there, it worths even waiting an hour in a que to eat here.. in the meanwhile you can have a walk in the neighborood and drinking something at the bar"
4777,19-07-2012 ,4.0,"This place is very crowded at nights but in the good way. It's located very well, on Mallorca and Rambla de Catalunya, so you can give your name to the hostess and go for a walk in the avenue. The restaurant looks great and the food is even better; lots of delicious traditional tapas dishes made of super fresh ingredients. The service is good considering the amount of people they need to serve. We prefer sitting on the bar, you get to see the dishes and get recommendations from the barmen. Whatever you do, by all means do not miss the camembert (or was it brie?) wrapped in almonds chips with strawberry jam on top.. it will change your life"
4778,18-07-2012 ,4.0,we love going to cerveceria catalana..it´s always packed with people....food and sangria are very nice!!!
4779,17-07-2012 ,3.0,"We returned to the Cerveceria Catalana in July after numerous visits in prior years. I have to say that we were slightly disappointed this time around, the restaurant is not differentiated by its authenticity nor it's food quality, there are many like it in Barcelona. It is still popular and often it is very difficult to get a seat, once you are seated, particularly at the bar, there is always the feeling that people are hovering behind you waiting for your seat. Forgetting this the food is still good but not excellent, the menu looked identical from the previous year. We will return but only to see if it has improved?"
4780,17-07-2012 ,4.0,"On my second trip to Barcelona I wanted to return to this tapas restaurant as I had enjoyed it twice on my previous visit. This time it was more convenient as my hotel was on Mallorca. Whay differed this time was that it was standing room only at an early hour, which we had not experienced on our previous trip. However, we were seated fairly quickly and served by two gracious servers. Everything we ordered was perfectly done and really tasty. It is well-worth the visit and the wait to get in."
4781,17-07-2012 ,3.0,"When we came to Barcelona, cerveceria was ranked top 10 in trip advisor. Since that time it just keeps getting busier and busier. The tapas are very well prepared and affordable, but it feels like a tapas factory now. We've had to wait consistently between 30 to 45 minutes to get a table for an early dinner (8 or 9 o'clock) and we haven't been going back mostly due to the wait times. The service is quick but it feels like they want to get you in and out as fast as possible so that they can seat more customers. Good food and good value, if you can get in."
4782,15-07-2012 ,3.0,I have gone here with friends on many trips to Barcelona. It is always very crowded and the wait is long (no reservations). The tapas are good but certainly not worth the rave reviews and hype shown on Trip Advisor.
4783,15-07-2012 ,5.0,A nice place in c/Mallorca where you can eat tapas. Value for money.
4784,15-07-2012 ,5.0,"This was a true GEM in Barcelona. We visited midweek and it was busy but with efficiency and friendliness we were served well despite being vegetarian we were advised on a wide range of dishes that were very tasty and washed down with local beer suggested by our very friendly waiter. Unfortunately on the Friday night we couldn't find the place till later and it was then BUSY and the wait for a table was going to be 50mins but we could have sat at the bar.When in Barcelona next, this is the place for me. It is where the locals are as well as some tourists in the know."
4785,14-07-2012 ,5.0,Great food in an easy going atmosphere. Efficient service and helpful staff. Flexible is also a big plus. No fuss about servings and tasting. Well done. We will be back for sure
4786,14-07-2012 ,5.0,"Maybe you'll get a table above a faulty aircon, maybe you'll wait an hour to get that table - but once you get seated, the party starts. Try everything, from basic breads to obscure Catalan phrases you don't understand. Our pick - navajas (those really long clams). Vine that goes superb with all the strong sea tastes - mania(very flowery on the nose but bone dry and stony cabernet blanc)-great value"
4787,14-07-2012 ,5.0,"im sure there must some remote, locals only tapas place in town that is better... but for me... a foreign tourist... this is the best... prices are very good... located in good place but not in the middle of the tourist trap... a lot of people... locals seem to go there as well... i like it a lto... beer is good, but beer is good anywhere... jajajajaja... the food is great... as i said... best tapas place in town"
4788,14-07-2012 ,5.0,"We arrived at this restaurant on a Tuesday night around 9:00pm, there was about a 45 minute wait (do not accept reservations). We decided to put our name down and walk around a bit.. This hotel is very conveniently located near a lot of shops ;). Once we were seated we were greeted with excellent service. Dish after dish was exceptional!! Service was very quick.. Food was not expensive at all and probably the best meal we had in Barcelona. "
4789,13-07-2012 ,5.0,"When tired of shopping in Passeig Gracia, this is a perfect place to take a break. You might need to wait for a table for a while, but it's well worth it. Do not miss the crema catalana!"
4790,13-07-2012 ,5.0,"Let me first say that I am a true foodie. I stumbled across this place and returned to eat here 4 times in the same trip with friends it was this good. Returning for another long weekend, I introduced foodie friends here and we ate here a number of times. The magic is this - simple, authentic spanish tapas. The place is flocked to by locals, so if you don't want to miss out, get there early. What can i recommend?....EVERYTHING....thats why we returned to work our way through the complete menu. Razor clams, sliders, creme catalana, calamari,......oh man i want to go back now..."
4791,13-07-2012 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by the hotel we stayed in near by, for being an upscale trendy Catalan tapas bar. And it certainly delivered. The place is usually packed all the time, and it's easy to see why. The food is exceptional, we especially loved the cabbreos, fried baby squid, fried peppers and their sangria. The staff are very helpful. The atmosphere is fresh and modern, the speed of service is great, it's very conveniently located. I think in the 4 days we were in Barcelona we went back 3 times taking different groups of friends. All round good experience and highly recommended."
4792,12-07-2012 ,5.0,"Easy to find, a few blocks off Cataluyna Plaza. Very crowded, excellent tapas, fun place. Bar, might be the place to sit, because you can see all of the dishes, but hard to get a seat, next best is a table. Very large restaurant, but busy and the food is great. It should be on everyone's list of places to go in Barcelona. Reservations are probably a good thing, but can be seated with a small wait without. We were there in May of 2012 and the city was very crowded with tourists and locals."
4793,12-07-2012 ,5.0,"EXCELLENT! BEST TAPAS RESTAURANT IN BARCELONA. I've visited here three times when I've only been to Barcelona twice for a total of seven days! It can get overly crowded here tho, since it's a very popular and famous restaurant. We had our names down for a table and they told us it would take over an hour ( ! ) and this place is large! But we luckily got seats by the bar counter, so we only had to wait 20 or so minutes. You don't need to place your name for a seat by the bar, if you're lucky enough to find a spot, it's yours!And I think it's much more of a fun dining experience if you sit by the bar because you can see all the tapas plates and fresh seafood lined up in front of you.The squid, shrimp, clams are all delicious. Do try the green peppers too. Actually, everything on their menu is a good bet. And don't forget to order a pitcher of sangria, it's the best that I've ever had anywhere."
4794,12-07-2012 ,1.0,"We went to Catalana based on the many positive reviews on TripAdvisor and boy were they wrong! the food here was extremely salty! Every dish we had, had insane amounts of salt on it to the point that it was inedible! I really have no idea where all the good reviews are coming from - we ordered about 6 different tapas ( mushrooms and asparagus, pimientos, calamari, montadito with shirmp and chicken etc.) and everything was overly salted. Having eaten AMAZING tapas in madrid and in the south of Spain, this restaurant just doesnt cut it!"
4795,12-07-2012 ,4.0,"Everyone told us that we HAD to visit Cerveceria Catalana while we were in Barca for 5 days.So, after visiting some of Gaudi's amazing sites, we headed for Cerveceria Catalana to see what the fuss was about. We knew it was going to be busy, so the wait didnt bother us. Ok, so the tapas was very nice - but it wasnt ""the"" meal of our time in Barcelona - we found that there were a number of other restaurants and tapas bars which produce equally good meals in a much more atmospheric (rather than just loud) environment.I suppose what raised our eyebrows was the fact that not all of the tapas we ordered came out to us, and having had our order corrected, our bill was presented to us with both the correct order and incorrect order (which they took away).We left having enjoyed the meal, but a meal which they made errors on our order and on our bill. Our tip - if its too busy, keep walking... there are a lot of awesome places to eat in Barca."
4796,11-07-2012 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was recommended to us by our concierges at Hotel Alma where we were staying in Barcelona. It about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We had been looking for a place to have tapas, but most of the cafes/bars made their tapas before lunch, closed for siesta time and served the same tapas again in the evening. The best time to go to Cerveceria Catalana is between 4 p.m.and 6 p.m. the earlier the better. It is indeed a happening place with long lines as it gets later - we tried to get in around 9 p.m. on two occasions, but the wait was too long. We ordered ""angry eggs"" which was recommended again by our concierge - a plate of crisp potato sticks in a mild sauce with two fried eggs on top, yolk runny. The server then tossed it all together breaking up the eggs. I am not an egg person, definitely not eggs that are runny, but it was delicious. We had ham croquettes which were also very good, I can't remember what else, but everything was FRESH and tasty. My husband had local beer and I enjoyed a lovely half bottle of cold cava. It was our last meal in Barcelona and our most memorable."
4797,11-07-2012 ,4.0,"We went here on our last night in Barcelona. It was very busy when we got there, with people sitting on the curb with drinks whilst waiting for a table. We were told at first that we needed a reservation, but then when we asked another waitress there let us in immediately as we had five people all there.There is a wide range of tapas, and the individual dishes are high quality and value. The ingredients were all fresh - the seafood was better than some in the restaurants down by the sea. The food came quickly (although the restaurant was completely full), but not all at the same time which gave us time to eat each and spaced out the meal instead of piling 12 dishes in at once.The staff were friendly and spoke English which made ordering easy.The restaurant is on a side street coming off Las Rablas, and the wide street isn't busy or dull.The fried potatoes (bravas con all i oli) and the green peppers are both highly recommended."
4798,10-07-2012 ,3.0,"It's popular - filled with tourists. The bar is happening and they even serve a cocktail or two. Huge range of alcohol - single malts to Campari to Tequila, unlike many Tapas bars. End of the day, tapas is good, but quite forgettable. Nothing was bad - except the cheesecake which was a stodgy wodge. But then, nothing was outstanding except for the service which was excellent. The Tapas consisted of the usual suspects, arranged alluringly on bread - prawns, crab, egg, Jamon, cheese, salmon, cucumber and tomato, anchovies etc. As I said all good, but not memorable. The queues outside were clearly for the alcohol. If you are a serious foodie, avoid. If you want a happening place, with ample alcohol and lots of young people you'll enjoy it."
4799,10-07-2012 ,5.0,On advice from the hotel we didnt book. This was fine at 1845 but would recommend you do if you plan to eat later as this is understandably a very popular restuarant. There were queues to get in as we were leaving - always a good sign ! Make sure you find the time to try it out. We really enjoyed the food and it was great value. 
4800,9-07-2012 ,5.0,"Fantastic, Fantastic food. We ate here on a recommendation from a friend, and so glad we did. The steak tapa was out of this world and grilled mushrooms over the top."
4801,9-07-2012 ,2.0,This place would get a very good vote from me but it is let down by the rude ignorant staff only interested in chatting amongst their selves and couldn't care less about the customers. The baguettes and drinks were a very good standard. Lovely donuts but sadly dry muffins.
4802,9-07-2012 ,5.0,"stumbled on what turned out to be one of the best tapas restaurants in the city--went back three times to eat through the menu. Beer's good too, no wonder it's crowded"
4803,9-07-2012 ,5.0,"Definitely worth a trip. We got there late and were told it would be an hour wait, but we were seated within 20 minutes. The drinks were good, and the tapas were phenomenal. Try the roasted red peppers with cod purée. "
4804,9-07-2012 ,5.0,"This is a very busy tapas place with both proper seating and tapas bar service. I thought it would be a bit of a dive for some reason, but it ended up exceeding all my expectations. We got there pretty late, 3pm for lunch or pre-siesta service (what I like to refer to it when you stuff your face at that hour). you can all the fresh seafood they have and the different selection of tapas available pretty much at the bar area as soon as you walk in. It's just such a great way to eat when you're travelling. Don't need language skills, just point. Though I do have to point out, our waiter spoke English very well and was patient with all our questions and translations we needed for tapas of the day (they also have an english menu). A bottle of Cava was cheap and good and everything we ordered was sooooo yummy. We kept adding to our order every time a waiter walked by with a yummy looking dish for another table. We ate until we could no longer move. It's one restaurant you won't want to miss in Barcelona."
4805,6-07-2012 ,5.0,A busy and buzzing restaurant serving tapas dishes. You need to get there early as you can't book and it's very popular with locals as well as tourists. They have a large choice of tapas dishes and everything we had was cooked well and the service was good. Try the deep fried baby squid they are wonderful! Definitely a great place to visit in Barcelona and will go again if I ever return.
4806,5-07-2012 ,5.0,"very local restaurant, if you love authentic spanish food and tapas you have to visit this Restaurant... it was one of the best for us!!"
4807,5-07-2012 ,4.0,"This is my favourite place to get tapas in Barcelona. It's cheap, but delicious and I always find the staff to be efficient and friendly . I recommend the escalivada amb formatge de cabra (aubergine and peppers with goat's cheese) for something traditionally Catalan. You have to wait a while for a table, but it's worth it - enjoy the cool night air and relax: you're in Catalunya, this is how things are! It's also a great place to go late at night - they're more than happy to have you sit down at 11.30pm!"
4808,5-07-2012 ,5.0,"3 rd day in Barcelona and finally some decent food. This place is in a league of its own. Busy though. Waited an hour for a table, but you can get stuck into the amazing tapas while you wait. The restaurants in the surrounding neighbourhood seem to he picking up the overflow and are no where near as good. Sirloin steak tapas was incredible.This is a must visit."
4809,4-07-2012 ,1.0,"After asking 3 waiters how long we had to wait, it was 8.30 in the evening, which for Spain is very early, I did not get an answer or anything else. Tried the same thing with someone who seemed to be of a ""higher rank"" with the same attitude, so we decided that they did not need our money and went looking for another restaurant where we enjoyed some good tapas with a nice service and good advise."
4810,4-07-2012 ,4.0,"Great atmosphere. I especially loved the mixed mushroom and asparagus dish, as well as the escalivada, which came with cheese. Cheap too. Yum.-FCVwww.firstclassvegetarian.com"
4811,4-07-2012 ,4.0,"If you can get there early enough, or are lucky enough, sit at the bar where you can select tapas from the glass cases... otherwise you have to select from the menus without 'visualizing' what you might want. Ask for the specials... these are always good!"
4812,3-07-2012 ,5.0,"this place was really top notch tapas, and really good value as well.I cannot rate the food highly enough!"
4813,3-07-2012 ,2.0,"After being hyped up about the restaurant through the reviews and recommendations from other sources, Cerveceria Catalana turned out to be a disappointing experience. I humored the obligatory wait (about 1 hour on a Monday evening, around 21:00) but was soon disappointed when our plates started to come out. I ordered about 6-8 tapas and the only good one is the veal sirloin. The Spanish omelet was okay. Everything else tasted mediocre- nothing special about the preparation nor the ingredients. I probably could have gotten them at another place for a cheaper price tag and with less waiting time. With that said, our bill for 2 came out to be around 45 euros and that includes a bottle of wine, so not too bad. I would recommend trying some other place. However, if you decide to try anyways, here are some pointers: (1) go before the dinner rush, before 20:45; (2) apparently you can wait at the bar and seat yourself if someone else leaves so that you don't have to put your name on the list; and (3) don't get the bread - a lot of people end up not eating them because they eat tapas instead and besides, they taste quite bland."
4814,1-07-2012 ,5.0,"Great food, friendly and helpful staff. A fun place to share food with friends. This is a happening place. Be prepared to wait but it's wel worth it. I found the bar the most entertaining, quickest to be seated, and best service."
4815,30-06-2012 ,4.0,"very good selection of tapas, funcrowd - would recommend"
4816,30-06-2012 ,4.0,"Although a bit crowded as it has become very famouse for tourists, food is very reliable and sure to please anyone looking for taoas and good ambiance"
4817,30-06-2012 ,5.0,"excellent food and very vibrant atmosphere.The staff were helpful as it was our first time for Tapas.It was very busy when we were there,but were lucky to get seats at the bar.Excellent restaurant."
4818,30-06-2012 ,5.0,"Recommended by our hotel, we had a few hours to kill before our return to Barcelona Airport. What a perfect place to have a leisurely lunch. On a Sunday afternoon the place was very busy but we were not rushed and our waiter advised us to order a few dishes, eat those and then order some more. A few bottles of wine and plenty of beautiful tapas later, we left feeling that we had had a fantastic dining experience. We were a little worried about the bill but the price was very reasonable. Just wish we had gone there on our first night!"
4819,30-06-2012 ,1.0,"We had the pleasure of eating here six years ago on our first trip to Barcelona. It was so outstanding that we ate there several times (we never do that) - no more! We should have run the other way rather than go in on our most recent visit. The friendly locals that used to run and work here were no where in sight. We were rudely treated and rushed by the new owners and workers - who, by the way, were clearly not Catalan or Spanish. There is absolutely nothing authentic left of this place. What a shame! They have flipped one of the best tapas places I've ever visited into a horrendous mash of terrible food and even worse service. The positive ratings surely come from first time visitors that would also love the cuisine of local chain Tapa Tapa. Do yourself a favor - save your money, your disappointment and your aggravation. Go to where the locals go. I sincerely hope for the sake of travelers everywhere that this formerly grand Tapas joint drops off this list. So sad!"
4820,28-06-2012 ,5.0,"Found this place on the advice of friends, and it did not disappoint -- food/drink, great crowds and reasonably priced."
4821,28-06-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant delivered as advertised. Food was delicious, very reasonably priced, with a varied menu. It is a tapas restaurant, so you get to experience alot of what they have to offer. Wine selection is nice, prices reasonable (most Spanish/Catalunya wine is fairly inexpensive, 18-40 euro per bottle. Great vibe in the restaurant, quite busy, but fun. I would definitely put this place on the ""cannot miss"" list when visiting Barcelona. Located just off the Passeig de Gracia, right in the ""zone""."
4822,28-06-2012 ,5.0,Cerveceria Catalana was one of our favourite restaurants in Barcelona. We knew it would be busy so we got there around 1:45pm (early for Spanish lunches) and got a table straight away - 10 minutes later people were queuing out the door! The food was so delicious and there was a huge menu compared to most tapas bars in Barcelona. We ordered 6/7 tapas and a drink each which came to €25 which was quite cheap compared to most places in Barcelona - and much nicer! Only a shame we didn't get time to go again. 
4823,28-06-2012 ,4.0,"We wanted a typical place to have some spanish tapas on our last day and we got it! You know you are at the right place if there is a lot of locals! We were a party of 8 and ordered a variety of tapas ranging from croquettes (Euro 1.10 each) to Navaja (Euro 8.70) to Tortilla patatas (Euro 2.90) and everything was absolutely delicious. Reservations seems to be a must as we were very lucky to get a table. We were too big a party to sit at the bar, but that seems like the best place to be so that you can visually choose what you want to eat."
4824,28-06-2012 ,5.0,"Try to get here early during high tourist season as the waiting list can get long. We had to wait for almost an hour for a table. (We arrived around 20.00 and were seated around 21.00)But it was worth it!!The service was excellent. The waiters worked really efficiently and the food arrived fast. No pretentious service which I appreciate. You can see that people come for the food and not all the fuss around it.The anjovies in vinegar was excellent! Must try for all of you that like sour/salt food.Grilled cuttle fish was also one of our favorites. Yummy Yummy :) Also, don't miss out on the patatas bravas."
4825,27-06-2012 ,5.0,"Great selection of tapas -- super fresh seafood and specials as well as all the usuals (pan con tomat, anchovies, croquettes etc...) They don't take reservations and there's usually a line of young hip locals and travelers in the know. There are two tapas bars as you enter that are first come first serve and then two rooms of tables. We went at 11:00 pm on a Wednesday night and waited about 20 minutes for a table, but it was worth it."
4826,26-06-2012 ,4.0,"We read all the reviews before our trip and expected good, value for money food but a long wait for a table - not wrong there on any count! You can reduce the wait if you know in advance that you have to venture inside to put your name down for a table! "
4827,25-06-2012 ,4.0,Very busy Tapas bar with great presentation and variety. Service was initially a little rushed and we had a feeling that their main interest was clearing you out to fill the table again. However once we placed our order service was more personal and attentive. The choice of dishes was great and the display counter presentation of all the freshly prepared Tapas was exactly as all high end tapas bars should be. Was pleasantly surprised when presented with the bill and could not believe that such good quality could be had for so little.
4828,25-06-2012 ,4.0,"This place was recommended to us and we loved it. When we reached there was a huge line in front of the place, always a good sign that the foods good and will be fresh. We were told that it would be a 45 minute wait....but they seated us in half the time when they realized we were with kids. The menu was in English and the waiter helped us through it and recommended a few nice dishes. The foie gras, prawns, crabs were really good! The food was served quickly and the place was quite reasonable. A lot of other local Barcelona people also recommended this place and I would definitely recommend a visit....or more!"
4829,24-06-2012 ,5.0,"Upon a recommendation from a local colleague, I checked into my hotel and walked the three blocks from ""El Diagonal"" to this fantastic spot. It didn't disappoint. Took a seat at one of the bars in front of the restaurant and was able to watch a few others' orders before deciding upon my own. As the name implies, there are a few beers to select from, so I chose an Estrella, which I was told by the gentleman behind the counter was ""la cerveza primera de Espana."" I only tried two tapas, but both were outstanding. One was a dish of lightly fried green peppers other was a small out-of-this world baguette sandwich with tuna/anchovy green olives and roasted red peppers. Others may tell you that the big attraction is the affordable prices. I would return to this place even if prices were doubled."
4830,24-06-2012 ,5.0,"I strongly recommend this restaurant. Good variety of tapas that tasted excellent. Friendly personnel, giving good recommendations and service. We had to to wait 30-40 minutes for a table outside the restaurant, but it was definately worth the wait. The restaurant had a nice and fresh interior. The tables outside were located at relatively busy street. Overall excellent experience."
4831,23-06-2012 ,5.0,This was a busy Tapas restaurant that had everything we wanted. They had a lovely fish and seafood selection that made me very happy. The prices were actually reasonable for the freshness and great quality. The service was some of the best in the bizz. We all really enjoyed our food and Cava.
4832,22-06-2012 ,5.0,"We absolutely loved this place for tapas. Best to sit at the bar where you can see all of the choices and things being cooked - as well as talk to the guys working back there. It felt like such an upscale dinner and special experience but it wasn't very expensive. Definitely recommend the shrimp skewers, nut encrusted camembert, Spanish omelette......so good! Also the Catalanian Cream was to die for. We will be back there!Can be a little hard to get a seat, as it's a popular place - but seats at the counter you just grab as they come, and they are better anyways."
4833,21-06-2012 ,5.0,"The restaurant was recommended by our hotel staff. When we got there, there was a large crowd of people waiting for a table (we were warned that there might be a wait, but that it would probably not be too long). I went to give them our name, and when they asked me how large our party was, (we were only two people), we got lucky and were seated immediately! We were given a menu in English and the waiter was very patient with us and all of our questions.The house white wine was good.The food came out quickly and was delicious. We enjoyed everything we ordered (especially the grilled mushrooms and asparagus). Our bill was very reasonable. We went there on our last night in Barcelona. It was a nice way to end our holiday."
4834,21-06-2012 ,5.0,If you want to try Tapas the right way ... you need to go to Cerveceria Catalana ... the best tapas ever!!! ... .SEat at the bar and order 1/2 of a Cava .. or 1!!! ... the bacalao au miel is fantastic ... colosal fresh shrimps .... camembert coated with almond and raspberry sauce on top ... patatas bravas ... oh my God ... my mouth is watering!!! Not cheap ... but fresh high quality food!!! ... fast pace place and always full ... that should tell you !!!!
4835,21-06-2012 ,5.0,"great food, good wine, great location, reasonable prices. what more you need?this restaurant is like the factory, very busy: waiters were flying around, giving their best to service their guests.sometimes you will have to wait but not too long. we were paying around EUR 50 for two - usually tomato bread and jamon, 8-10 tapas and the bottle of wine. great value for money."
4836,21-06-2012 ,4.0,It is true from most of the comments ... long waits but worth the experience - so yummy that I went back twice in 4 days!
4837,19-06-2012 ,4.0,"You need to queue for this restaurant but very good food, service and atmosphere."
4838,19-06-2012 ,5.0,Busy restaurant but good service. Good choice of amazing tapas
4839,19-06-2012 ,5.0,"Been going to Barcelona for years and visiting Cerveceria Catalana is a ritual that has never disappointed. The minute you step through the crowds permanently posted in from of the restaurant your eyes will be drawn to the plates of tapas displayed behind the bar fronts. Great variety and pretty much everything is worth trying.... even their mini burgers. Personal favorites, shoe string potatoes with fried egg on top, fried artichokes, pimentos, etc.Register your name with hostess as soon as you get there, be prepared for a 15-30 minutes wait. If there are only 2 or 3 of you, wait behind bar stools for people to leave and sit by the food!"
4840,18-06-2012 ,5.0,"Turned up at 3pm on a Friday, place was packed to the rafters. Had a 30min wait to get a table.We had 7 tapas and 2 drinks each (white wine and leffe beer). All in 39€ - quite a surprise.Chicken & ham croquettes- crispy crumbs and cheesy taste.Pimientos de padron- fried green peppers. Some were really hot but the majority mild.Tortillas patatas- Spanish omelette. Dense and filling.Patatas bravas- crispy cubed potatoes coated with the spicy sauce and aoli sauce. Very garlicky but tasty.Manchego slices of cheeseVeal and padron pepper. Chunk of seared veal with a padron pepper. Very nice.Mini burger. Minced beef burger, about 1"" in diameter with a mini bun and onions. So, so soft and tasty.Well worth the visit. We left at 5pm and it was a lot quieter so a better time. There were bar stools that you could eat at, with all the tapas in front of you. If it had been quieter it would have been good but it was so busy around this area I wouldn't have enjoyed it."
4841,17-06-2012 ,2.0,"This time I would like to be short. There is no sense to talk much on food, etc,.. this place is at least not for dinner.It is really very strange why in many reviiews we can see- ""food is excellent""? This restaurant looks like much more a fast food place. That is all. I guess it was a great job to make it popular in TA and in image."
4842,16-06-2012 ,4.0,"The food is great, service average. If you plan to go for the dinner plan to wait at least 45 min but it's well worth it."
4843,16-06-2012 ,5.0,"Simply amazing.. cant get enough of this place. Been twice in two days! Leaving tomorrow, will go for a quick meal before flight!"
4844,16-06-2012 ,5.0,"Food was great. People were great. Highly recommend. Go early or plan to wait. But waiting is part of the fun, grab a drink and relax. "
4845,16-06-2012 ,5.0,"Too be honest i have not tried alot of tapas in my life, but if this place is any indication of true authentic tapas then i have died and gone to tapas heaven. We loved this place so much we went for lunch and went back for dinner too. Despite the fact we had to wait over an hour both times, i cant reiterate enough...please just be patient so you can enjoy the experience. The menu is long and varied, and after ordering 5-8 plates you`ll see what someone else has got, and ask `whats that?` and probably end up ordering that too. This place was always packed. Even when we left at midnight, people were still queueing to get in. The lovely hostess who takes your name, and then calls it out again about an hour later was lovely. She recognised us when we returned and generally made us feel that little bit special. The veal sirloins, the cuttlefish and the squid are all dishes that will stick in our minds as being totally sublime and i cannot recognise this place enough. Try it. You wont regret it!"
4846,15-06-2012 ,5.0,Was recommended to go to this restaurant by my daughter who had previously been. Went for lunch since we couldn't get in during evening as i was always mobbed. was a 3min walk from hotel. was impressed when the waiter noticed we had received a 'bad' bottle of wine. This was whisked away and quicklty replaced with a new bottle. Only 'down side' was the rubbery squid. I did not think I would have had to complain about such a problem in this restaurant. Fab atmosphere
4847,14-06-2012 ,5.0,"I had dismissed tapas as a fad until the manager of our B & B advised us to go here. We had walked past it the night before and couldn't even get close to the door. Not surprisingly even though we went early we had to wait for a table for the four of us. It was great. Catering for a non seafood person the waiter Ruel made sure there was also an appropriate plate to cater for all our needs. Also he made sure that the food flow was such that all flavours were separate and identifiable. So the cuttlefish (to die for) was followed by the peppers, then the sausage (if I could only remember the name!) and then cheese.Even though there were people waiting at the bar there was no pressure to move us on. Great experience!! Ask for Ruel - when we ordered a wine he advised it was not right and recommended another. During the dinner he bought us a glass of wine which we thought did not compliment the food. It was what we had ordered!!"
4848,14-06-2012 ,4.0,"Well worth a visit. Had to wait 20-25 minutes on a weekday in early June at 9 p.m. Can see how the wait could get really long in peak season. Most dishes cooked quite well. The fried mini green peppers got mixed reviews at the table are were a large serving. If you want a leisurely meal, suggest you only order a couple of dishes at a time. We ordered about 8 for 4 people and the food came flying out of the kitchen. Desserts sampled were all very good."
4849,12-06-2012 ,5.0,"Nice atmosphere, lot of people and great quality/price ratio."
4850,11-06-2012 ,5.0,This is a high end Tapas restaurant with the best food and Sangria we had in Spain.Do not miss! 
4851,11-06-2012 ,4.0,"the location is perfect, the food is prety good, the service is very nice but.... if you do not go on first time to have lunch you have to wait for a long time out side for a table..."
4852,9-06-2012 ,5.0,"Ate until we were stuffed. All for under £40.00 Food was amazing, service was charming. Be sure you get there before 8 if you want to get a table. We went the previous day at 9 and there was a 40 minute wait."
4853,9-06-2012 ,4.0,"As everyone says, it's a busy restaurant so better to get there a little early if you don't like to wait long.The service is quick, the dishes pretty good and beers and wines are keeping up with the quality of food.Definitely a place to stop at if you're going to Barcellona! And... it's just around the corner from some of the best Tourist attractions."
4854,8-06-2012 ,5.0,"After putting our name on the waiting list we ordered a drink and stood at the bat watching the amazing plates of food being delivered to the tables and just soaking up the atmosphere. As I put my finished glass down our name was called.....perfect timing. We ordered a bottle of Rioja, green peppers, tortilla, cod, olives, tomato bread and prawns in garlic, all were absolutely gorgeous. The bill was €46. We will definitely be recommending this to all our friends who visit Barcelona."
4855,7-06-2012 ,4.0,"A place with good quality tapas, beers and wines. Great value for money! It is a very busy restaurant with effective service so don´t expect a slow dinner in a peaceful environment. Almost always a queue but worth waiting a while!"
4856,6-06-2012 ,5.0,"You have to be patience to get a table, but it is worth it, the tapas are delicious and the drinks come really cold, amazing."
4857,5-06-2012 ,3.0,"We went there because its listed on many tour guide book. As expected, its crowded with tourists. They have English menu and waiters all speak English well. We spent about $90 and focused on seafood Tapas. To compare with other places like those inside the Market at La Rambla, the seafood was over-cooked a little. And its overcook for clam, razor-clam, prawn, fish, all of them. The ingredients are good, we can taste the ""sweatness"", but they all overcooked. The atmosphere is good. If you really care about food, not so about the environment, go to the Market during lunch."
4858,5-06-2012 ,5.0,"On business to Barcelona with friends, we were recommended to this tapas restaurant although they don't take reservations. Wow! Busy, buzzing and happening. We elbowed in to give our name and squeezed through the throng of Barcelona foodies. The wait was estimated at one hour and an American ex-pat overheard our hesitation and advised we hold out. He was SO right! Grab a drink, chat to the animated bar staff and get a taste of local life at the quality end of the spectrum. Next thing you know we're sat at a bar with plate after plate of the most mouth-watering delicious explosions of quality tapas taste known to man. Sangria only comes by the carafe but you can work your way through the spectacular Spanish wine list by the glass. We tried our best! Half way through, one of the reception girls came to find us and advise our table was ready, but no need as we were happily settled. We noticed they were remembering names and faces of the hoardes of people in and out - thats a top-ten for attentiveness and a talent for keeping everybody happy in such a lively and vibrant atmosphere. The food kept coming and the staff were a busy joy. A rare jewel like this place reminds you why we travel."
4859,5-06-2012 ,5.0,"One of the trendiest places in Barcelona especially if your a fan of barras! The service is exquisite, the food never disapoints and the beer ice cold.Try and sit at the counter, observing the workers serving with such accuracy and speed its trully unbelievable!!"
4860,5-06-2012 ,5.0,"Our favorite tapas .Very crowded ,busy good service and attention to all the crowd ,if you are in a hurry ,its not for you.The Best Tapas In Barcelona .returned 4 times in 10 days drink or eat or smoke a cigar outside."
4861,4-06-2012 ,5.0,"The tapas we had here were fantastic. Try the specials of the day - you won't be disappointed.The highlight was the Sangri and the creme catalan. Make sure you save room for it!If you want a table, it's best to get there early (say 6 pm). They do not take reservations. I know it's not very Spanish to eat that early but if you do, you get the chance to have a second dinner later in the night somewhere else :)(Menus available in English)"
4862,3-06-2012 ,5.0,"All tapas are freash, tasty, very very yummmy!Enjoy one if the best tapas place that Barcelona has to offer!Cheers!"
4863,3-06-2012 ,4.0,"As usual in Barcelona, service is pretty regular. But food was awesome!"
4864,3-06-2012 ,5.0,"Simple, not expensive, a lot of people out there, daily tapas changing, the only thing is not good enough that for table you need to wait, you can't reserve it in advance"
4865,3-06-2012 ,5.0,This tapas bar is hard to beat! We had to go back a few times during our Barcelona visit as they really spoiled us with the quality of their tapas.Get here before 6pm if you want to get a table. Keep an eye on their specials as we found them even better than their regular menu items. Thank you TA contributors for helping us find this gem of a Tapas Bar!
4866,3-06-2012 ,5.0,"Never come to Barcelona without visiting here. Four glasses of house wine for less than 8 euros. Veal, prawns, mini hamburgers to die for. Ask for huevos cabreos, you will not be disappointed. Do not be put off by having to wait up to an hour, rarely does it take that long and it is worth the wait!"
4867,2-06-2012 ,5.0,"We arrived from the airport at 10:30pm and were staying over the road... the hotel suggested this bar/restaurant and we eventually arrived here at around 11:45pm to be seated, served great red wine at the perfect temperature and an assortment of tapas which kep us going until 1am. The food was fantastic - portions were just right (we jjust ordered too many!) and the service was attentive without being over the top... they even smiled at our limited Spanish... we liked it so much we went back - and will return again the next time we stay in Barcelona. (April 2011)"
4868,2-06-2012 ,4.0,"We were advised by our hotel (Room-mate Emma) that there was good Catalan food at this restaurant and we were not disappointed. We had tapas which included one order of patatas bravas (really good), one order of a piquillo pepper stuffed with minced cod and topped with melted cheese (VG) two plates of pan tomate (VG) one skewer of shrimp, calamari and mushrooms as well as two beers, all for 21.40 euros including tax. Service was excellent and English was spoken and understood well. The place looks small from the outside but is very big inside as well as very busy. BTW this is the correct spelling for cerveseria."
4869,2-06-2012 ,5.0,"Wonderful fresh seafood tapas as well as the traditional Spanish fare. Probably best bravas in town. Love the jabugo and manchego cheese plates, and grilled cuttlefish. Try to be adventurous and order off their menu del dia (in catalan only, ask the waitors, they're quite helpful). Went here twice during our week in Barcelona. Popular with locals and tourists alike. Make sure you get there early. This place has a long line up everyday of the week. Tip: when waiting for a table in the dining room, try to hang out at the bar, grab a drink. You won't be able to hear them calling your name from the outside."
4870,30-05-2012 ,5.0,"The place is always full of locals and tourists. They serve all kinds of tapas. Be ready to wait about an hour for table or go to the bar. The bar will serve you the same tapas but on a more relaxed environment. Try the ""Clara"", it's a very, very light beer and cheap! Also ask for the grilled tapas like the sliders, shrimp skewers, etc...they were awesome. Everything we tried was really good. Not a cheap place but it was really worth it!"
4871,30-05-2012 ,5.0,"My favorite tapas restaurant during a recent 5 day visit to Barcelona. I was staying at the nearby Alma Hotel which recommended this place highly. Without question, the best tasting salmon tapas I have ever had...the salmon was doused in Spanish olive oil and topped with chopped onions, red peppers, and green peppers. I could have devoured the entire plate by myself.I had a lamb tapas that was amazing, a 'hamburger' tapas, grilled shrimp, and more. This place is extremely reasonably priced (glass of Spanish Rioja wine at only 1.8 Euro per glass; beer equally reasonably priced). This place is almost always crowded and it can take awhile to get a table or a seat at the bar but it is definitely worth it. Loved this place."
4872,30-05-2012 ,5.0,very good / well priced / highly recommend. Ate here twice 
4873,30-05-2012 ,2.0,"Went here after reading TA reviews and I was very dissapointed. Its is a very busy and overcrouded place full of tourists, staff are extremelly rude and unfriendly. The only good thing is food but you find the same quality food elsewhere for half a price. Never again"
4874,29-05-2012 ,5.0,"Que, wait do whatever you need to in order to eat at this place without a doubt the best tapas I've ever had, The baby squid was phenomenal, But just be prepared to wait for a table."
4875,29-05-2012 ,5.0,"We ate here twice during our three-day visit. It was fun to order new things without knowing exactly what they would be like. Everything turned out to be fantastic. Do try the sangria, also."
4876,29-05-2012 ,5.0,The street view of this cafe/restaurant was so appealing we went inside for a closer look and wow! We vowed to return for a meal and glass or two of Cava! Simply stunning array of choices of Tapas. Highly recommend a visit.
4877,29-05-2012 ,5.0,"My husband and I were in Barcelona for 4 days, we ate here twice. Being recognized by the wait staff was a little embarassing, however its a testament to the restaurant. We never made reservations and both times we had to wait almost 25 minutes for a table. This place is so popluar and it was always crowded with locals and tourists. Fun atmosphere, huge selection of tapas and you can't beat the prices. The plates were delicious, fresh and presented beautifully. The staff were helpful with translating the menu and the other patrons of the restaurant helped us as well. Never had a bad meal or experiance and would love to visit again."
4878,28-05-2012 ,3.0,"This is a good tapas restaurant located very close to the Plasseig de Gracias. You'll find countless restaurants like this one on each artery, and although it is pretty typical, it is packed with crowds all hours. We waited about 45 minutes for a sidewalk table. Interestingly enough the wait for a table inside was much longer. Between the two of us, we tried seven or eight tapas. I found the patatas bravas to be some of the better ones we tried in Spain. The ham and cheese selections were pretty common and nothing really spectacular. One of the daily specials was a roasted asparagus tapa, which was quite tasty. If you're in the area and can get a table, it's an ok choice. Just keep in mind this is kinda like a Cheesecake Factory for tapas. You can find much better and more authentic tapas if you venture deeper into one of the neighborhoods."
4879,28-05-2012 ,5.0,"This is a must go in Barcelona, the tapas are the best I've had in the city. I've tried a few, I highly recommend the mini squid a la romana, the tortilla, las patatas bravas, the sticks of camembert, pan con tomate, I could keep going but I'll just be reciting the menu. Even though this is a cerveceria, the sangria is delicious as well. Try to go there with some time to spare as the place is packed most of the time and you might have to wait for a table. Try the desserts, the budin de coco is already reason enough to go there."
4880,28-05-2012 ,5.0,"Their small sandwiches are pretty amazing. Some of the other favorites were the grilled calamari, sangria, and a unique egg creation."
4881,28-05-2012 ,5.0,"Excellent place, food and environment, it's always full of people so if you don't want to wait more than one hour to sit you' d better arrive before 9 pm or after midnight!"
4882,27-05-2012 ,5.0,Nice place to eat with a good service and a variety of tasty tapas. We order five different plates with two beers and one desert and we pay 30â¬.Good value for money. 
4883,27-05-2012 ,5.0,"We stayed in Barcelona for 6 days, and we've been there three times! Amazing atmosphere, great location with fantastic food, very fresh, well-prepared, fast, and resonable price. It's always crowed, especially at night time. Arrived before 6pm to avoid long wait. Really love it! My husband and I are looking forward to visiting Barcelona again!在巴塞隆納住六天，就去吃了三次。TAPAS非常的好吃，氣氛也很輕鬆愉快，地點也非常方便，就在米拉之家和巴特婁之家附近。食物非常的新鮮，如果坐吧台可以直接看到菜色，用手指點菜即可，沒有語言的隔閡非常的快速和方便，價格也很公道。但生意非常的好，尤其晚上人潮非常多，建議六點以前到比較不用排隊。"
4884,27-05-2012 ,5.0,"Our body clocks were screwed up and we wound up needing somewhere to eat. This place didn't disappoint! Not only does it have an extensive and delicious menu, but it is one of the very few restaurants in Barcelona who's kitchen stays open until 0100.We got there just after 0000 and found the place was packed. Put our names on the waiting list and grabbed a drink among the large group of locals, expats and tourists.No surprise that a few things were out on the menu with how late it was but there were so many choices that we easily found other items to dine on. We finished off dinner with the assorted cakes that was awesome!The service was very good (spoke good English); the food was superb; and the price was great. Highly recommend heading here - early or late."
4885,26-05-2012 ,4.0,Tapas were traditional but tasty and fresh. Cheese platter was huge and a nice variety. Our waiter was not as friendly as others we have had in Barcelona but service was still fast (although he did forget 2 of our dishes). I had an issue with one of my tapas dishes (something hard I almost cracked my tooth on) but the manager came over quickly and was professional (and returned the dish for us) -nice to see he takes their customer's satisfaction seriously - Hard to find in Europe where they are not as customer satisfaction oriented as the US!
4886,26-05-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant was fantastic. Luckily we went with friends who could speak Spanish, we had several waiters and one spoke very good English. We had a group of 6 and we left so full.....and our bill was only 134Euros!! We had drinks, tapas, and dessert. You must have the fried peppers, calamari, and the filet (or sirloin) tapas were to die for! Heck just have one of everything!! We are definitely going to try to get back there before returning home. Don't miss it!"
4887,26-05-2012 ,5.0,"We ate here once for dinner, twice for breakfast and once for dessert on a 2 night stay in Barcelona after the Couple we rented our apartment from recommended it. The food is fresh, well-prepared, fast, and inexpensive. Go early to avoid a long wait or try to sit at the bar."
4888,24-05-2012 ,5.0,"best tapas place in Barcelona !!we've been there twice in one weekend.you must order the cheese sticks !and the mini burgers , yummi !!!"
4889,24-05-2012 ,4.0,"Must haves: fried calamari, grilled pork loin & the fried cheese coated with nuts. Long wait time for dinner, but that is indicative of a good restaurant."
4890,22-05-2012 ,4.0,"Bustling venue, expect too wait at least 30 mins crowded just find a spot the waiters will come too u no matter what. The sangria was best we tasted, Camembert tapa was best of the bunch and the mini hot dogs were quite unique. Will return for the atmosphere and too meet new people and too eat again Do not miss if u are near "
4891,22-05-2012 ,4.0,"The above is great but the easyjet seating policy is a real put off. We waited 30 minutes in a disorganized melee of American, European & Asians all confused as to what was the order of play and who was in the queue and who had already queued. You need to have time on your hands and be a patient person to choose this restaurant."
4892,22-05-2012 ,5.0,"WAUW, that's the feeling I had when I left this bar. Very nice tapas for a very good price. A lot of Spanish people. We arrived at 12.30 pm and that was just on time. Half an hour later there where about 20 people waiting to get a table. So be prepared!"
4893,21-05-2012 ,5.0,"We went at 4 pm because that is the time we landed and got to the hotel, etc...It was almost empty. We sat at the bar which was ok, but I believe at the table the waiter was more explicative and would have help in order to be able to know what to order.In any way, the food was excellent! It was a good way to start Barcelona!We tried to go back on Friday night around 10 pm and ... Forget it! It was like a different place! The lines were so big I could not even reach the person taking the names...We went to Paseo de Gracia to another tapas place, a name with an X that I cant remember, not so good as cerveria catalana but not so bad either! It was full, but we were able to make to the bar!"
4894,21-05-2012 ,4.0,"Good place to have a drink and tapas , but during the lunch and dinner is very crowded , the best hour is from 3 to 6 p.m."
4895,20-05-2012 ,5.0,"I went twice to this restaurant in 2 days - that shows how much I loved it! The atmosphere is fantastic: hip and modern decor, buzzing at all times of day. Arrive early if you want to eat there at night, as you can face 1 hour waiting times or more. The tapas are amazing and really fairly priced. The service is also pretty good considering the place is full of customers all the time. I love this restaurant and it's a must in Barcelona!"
4896,20-05-2012 ,4.0,"We came around 10.30 pm and it was crawling. We waited for aprox 1h. While you wait you can order tapas at the bar. It looked delicious, and it tasted wonderful. When we got seated at the table, we ordered a 5 dish variety tapas dish, and we got a seafood plate. We didn't enjoy that so much, so we ordered 3 other tapas dishes with tasted yummy. And the temperanillo wine we got reccomented was heaven. The beer was very very good. But it was so busy there, the waitress didn't have time to say ""enjoy your food"". The dishes was almost thrown at the table while they where running around. No smiles for you!"
4897,20-05-2012 ,5.0,"Locals usually have dinner late and this place becomes packed quickly. So try to arrive before 8pm (for the dinner, of course) and put your name on the list (no reservations accepted).Food is great and the range of available beers is good. I agree with other reviewers saying you could pay twice for the food elsewhere."
4898,20-05-2012 ,5.0,"most reccomended tapas restaurant in Barcelona; mantains the promises.Good service but most waiters seem to be asian and not spanish. However all quite kind with customers.Payed lot for amusch small glass of wine. Wide choice of tapas both meat and fish, and very good tasting.It is very wise to be there early for dinner (no later than 8 p.m.) otherwise keep ready to wait.the dessert (catalan cream) was good but not unforgettable.Bottom line: good go there it a glomurous restaurant for tourist but also attended by locals. A step or two beyond a simple tapeteria."
4899,17-05-2012 ,4.0,It's going to be crowded. you need to early if you want a table
4900,15-05-2012 ,5.0,don't be intimidated by the crowds...put your name in at the hostess stand if you can get to it. They don't take reservations...so don't bother... Go grab a glass of wine or whatever you want to drink and stand behind the bar...if seats open up at the bar take them...its all good...went 2X in 2 days on our last two days in Barca...reasonable...not too pricey...
4901,15-05-2012 ,5.0,I would have paid 2x the price for the food we had and been thrilled
4902,14-05-2012 ,4.0,"I have been wanting to write this review ever since we went to Spain in June 2011. This restaurant was our main stop for food while in Barcelona, the food was excellent ( tapas and montaditos), wine and atmosphere and last but not least the CREMA CATALANA. If you don't have a reservation they are able to accomodate you in a reasonable time. The pices were also reasonable. I would definetely go back if in Barcelona!!!"
4903,14-05-2012 ,5.0,"excellent food, excellent service, very reasonable price"
4904,13-05-2012 ,5.0,"Very tasty dishes at a reasonable price. It was incredibly crowded when we went and had to be put on a waiting list (15-30 minute wait). The atmosphere inside was energetic and vibey, while a little more relaxed outside.We were seated outside within 20 minutes. Our waiter was incredibly fast and efficient and even told us to stop ordering as we were going to order too much food! He was right - the first round of tapas was definitely enough for the two of us, and it was all (mostly) delicious."
4905,13-05-2012 ,5.0,"Went here as a. Opulent then took the rest of the gang (family and friends) the next night. Everyone loved it, there was something for everyone. Very busy, we needed a table for 7 so it was tough, we were told an hour however a little over 10 minutes later we were sat down. Would recommend the sample platter.Also great for breakfast...lwould recommend the spanish omelette ...yummy!"
4906,12-05-2012 ,5.0,"Rumored to be the best tapas restaurant. Definitely very good,lots of choice, very reasonably priced, great staff"
4907,12-05-2012 ,5.0,"We were recommended to go here and eat tapas, really glad we did so. Actually we went one day for lunch and returned two nights later for dinner as well. This is a popular place, but they have a lot of seeting so it does not take long to have a table for two. I guess it was a little bit easier as we were not here ""high season"". If you can, book your table in advance.Some people say it is expensive, i really dont think so as u can feel the meat, fish and tapas over all are of high standard. Try the veal - so tender, and the fresh gambas or shrimps in garlic. They also had good prices of bottles of wine."
4908,10-05-2012 ,5.0,"Great food, great service, great astomphere. We even went twice within 5 days of our trip. Would highly recommend!!"
4909,10-05-2012 ,4.0,"The tapas are varied, but almost everything tastes good. Not cutting edge, or quite as good as Tapeo, but at least fresh and tasty, and at really reasonable prices (4-7 euros for most). In Barcelona, that's a bit of a challenge these days. So 4 stars for keeping that available. In the Eixample area, this was the best tapas option we found.Yes, the crowds are pretty heavy no matter what time of week or day or night. So definitely reserve ahead or put your name down and come back when they say to. And please be nice to the staff, who are great if you remain respectful as you should, and are dealing with the crowds as best they can. FYI, there are 2 separate lists, 1 for inside and 1 for outside."
4910,9-05-2012 ,5.0,"Even if we like to try new places, we made an exception for Cerveceria Catalana. During our stay in Barcelona we went 3 times for the three meals and always very happy about it. We tried very good sweets for breakfast (like homemade cakes), great tapas, montaditos, etc. for lunch and dinner. It's a restaurant in which mainly locals and regulars customers go, other then some tourists (not too many). Therefore, the only disadvantage is that in order to have a table you have to wait at least half an hour. If you show up early enough (lunch around 12:00 is pretty early for locals) you have good chances to have a table without waiting too long. At night it's pretty crowded and you might have to wait more, but it's definitely worth it !"
4911,9-05-2012 ,5.0,"It's best to come early (12 AM) or on weekdays, because it can get very crowdy. All types of montaditos, plates, salads and fresh seafood and fish are displayed on the counter, so the best thing is to sit at the counter instead of at a table in the restaurant. That way you can just point and pick what you like. Everything we ate was really delicous: the montaditos with ham, ham/salad/mayonaise, salmon,,.., the freshly fried little fish, the octopus, the grilled squid and scampi with 3 types of mushrooms. Really great food !!!"
4912,9-05-2012 ,5.0,"This restaurant had been reccommended to us by friends and by our hotel. We arrived approx 8 o'clock and decided to wait for an outside table. We were told we would have to wait up to 1/2 hour so we had a drink outside in a very convivial atmosphere. After 15 mins our table was ready.We were impressed by the range of tapas dishes, and the prices of the wine compared to UK prices. We were with another couple and we consider ourselves to be reasonable judges of decent wine, but I can tell you that you needn't go any further than the house wines at approx 9 Euros per bottle! The tapas dishes were all great and averagely priced at approx 4 to 5 Euros, so the overall bill for a fabulous evening was about 80 Euros for 3 bottles of wine and 12 tapas dishes."
4913,9-05-2012 ,4.0,"I'd always meant to visit on previous trips but never quite got around to it. The food is very good and surprisingly, given the ""trendy"" look of the cerveceria, the prices compare very favourably with local bars and restaurants. Many people have already covered the practicalities of asking for a table but if you are a tired tourist - once organised, go grab a seat and a drink in one of the local bars while you wait so you can enjoy even more people watching! The staff on both our visits were great and having watched them help visitors who'd never eaten tapas before, they have great patience while working at manic speed and they are a great credit to the business. For those who like to know: 1 bottle of good house white €7.95, 2 Camembert ( tasty if not Spanish..) 4.70, 4 good slices of manchego cheese 5.10, pimientos de padron ( green peppers) 4.5, pan con tomate 2.45 plus 2 desserts and 2 coffees all came to €50.40. Great value for the quality, location, staff and tourist watching! Similar food plus a Baileys and a pacharan ( a liqueur I like but my husband says is like cough mixture... ) took us to just over €60 on our second night. There are many small, local bars and restaurants in the city with similar food and pleasant staff but its still a great city centre option even if too many visitors for me in comparison to the number of locals."
4914,8-05-2012 ,5.0,We were lucky enough to snag two seats at the Tapas bar. It was a Sunday night and the place was absolutely packed. The service was very helpful and sitting at the tapas bar made it easy as we were able to do a lot of pointing. The food was delicious and the crowd was fun. It was easy to make friends with our neighbors as we were in pretty tight quarters. After eating quite a bit and drinking a couple bottles of Cava we were very surprised how reasonably priced the final bill was. We loved it here. It's just too bad that Cerveceria Catalana is a few thousand miles away form my home. I would certainly go back.
4915,7-05-2012 ,4.0,Food and service was good once you got in. We waited for 1 hour and 10 minutes. No room to wait and had to stand in close quarters or outside (which was cold). I would not go back because of the wait.
4916,7-05-2012 ,4.0,"If you can book in advance, do it. The terrace is the best place when the weather is good. Food is good, it used to be a place only for locals until someone else found it ;-) Good chances to meet up with Spaniards."
4917,7-05-2012 ,5.0,"The Best!! Thanks to our taxi driver, Francisco for recommending it. We had a ball and some great food."
4918,7-05-2012 ,5.0,"Must be the best place to eat in barca, and one of the best anywhere. A delightful succession of classic tapas, perfectly prepared with the finest fresh ingredients (the meats, fish, seafood, coffee, and drinking chocolate are all of the highest quality, and the sangria always goes down smoothly too!). Delicious desserts are served with little tumblers of sweet sherry.Excellent service (fast but friendly) and great value (~â¬2-6 per small dish- you can eat- and drink- like kings for â¬25 a head).We actually chose our apartment to be close to this place! (Based on happy memories from last year; a very pleasant part of town it is too- beautiful buildings away from the crowds and pickpockets of la rambla, but still handy for everywhere). Tried a few other spots, but nowhere else came close and we were more than happy to eat here very regularly!!"
4919,6-05-2012 ,4.0,"Eat from the daily special's, expect to wait even if you arrive early (We waited 45 min's others were waiting for 75 min's). Make sure you are added to the list for a table. The food isn't life changing but it's good, staff are friendly atmosphere is great."
4920,6-05-2012 ,5.0,I have been here on every trip to Barcelona. Sit up stairs and next to the windows and enjoy. This is really a nice gem of a non-turist resturant in the middle of the turist area.
4921,5-05-2012 ,5.0,"The hype and crowd make it easy to disregard the potential greatness of a restaurant. Why do the crowds flock to Cerveceria Catalana? It would be easy to say that it is not worth the time one would spend awaiting a table. Well, we went there last night and six of us were seated at 8:30 p.m. in about 3 minutes. Seems sometimes one can get lucky. We entered past the people standing 3 or 4 deep. A table for 6 had just opened in the bar and we were there in perfect timing. The menu was extensive, but not so much that we were overwhelmed.Service was equal to the best I have ever had at a casual restaurant. There were two servers working in tandem to provide us with everything we could need. The food came quickly, was very good, in ample quantity and varied in taste so that sharing made the experience even better.As I left a couple from the USA asked me is the food worth the wait? I said it was. The people of Barcelona have voted and confirmed the value provided at Cerveseria Catalana. I told them that coming a bit early on another night might be an alternative for them. They thanked me and decided to stay. I hope they enjoyed their meal as we did."
4922,3-05-2012 ,4.0,"The place is really nice and food is incredible! It worth the queu which must be done since they do not accept reservation. You have to go there I you are in Barcelona and be very patient while you are waiting for being seated. Otherwise you can also eat at the bar! Definitely, one of the best place in Barcelona!"
4923,2-05-2012 ,4.0,"Well located near the main shopping area and not far from the Sagrada Familia, this place has the advantage of being quite large as well as being open on Sunday. We got there at 2 pm, they told us that the wait was about half and hour yet ten minutes later we were given our table. Excellent tapas all the way and superb beer! We skipped desserts but the surely looked delicious!"
4924,1-05-2012 ,2.0,"One of those places which do not want you to come back... There must be better choices in Barcelona, it is not worth waiting 45 min for the table."
4925,29-04-2012 ,5.0,"We arrived at 10 pm and they said 30 minute wait. We ordered drinks at the bar and two seats opened up in front of us so we sat there immediately. A couple next to us ordered a plate of mini octopus and it looked great, so, we got one too along with a plate of lamb, which was out of this world and calamari sprinkled with olive oil. All the seafood was so fresh and tasty. We got a Lowenbrau b/c I haven't see that beer in ages, but it went so well with the seafood. The guy behind the bar was very friendly and helpful. By 11 pm there wasn't a wait at all. We had flan for dessert and it hit the spot to finish the night. Cost was very reasonable and atmosphere was great!"
4926,29-04-2012 ,5.0,"Honestly the best Tapas I ever had.If you are looking for great Tapas thats the place to go to.Good service, tasty food, and gentle waiters.Only issue is you might wait for 20 minutes (minimum) to be seated as its always crowded. "
4927,29-04-2012 ,5.0,I had dinner here last Saturday night with my family and loved it. Not having been to Barcelona before and not wanting to go to any of the Touristy places with bad food we relied on reviews on Trip advisor. This restaurant is in a really nice part of Barcelona and it's an easy and pleasant walk from the Metro. When we arrived it was packed and we gave our name to go on a waiting list. We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. We squeezed in and found a spot on the bar and ordered some drinks. The young guy behind the bar was so efficient and working very hard. We knew there would be a wait - at the time I didn't realise they didn't take bookings - we hadn't booked as we don't speak any Spanish so trying to book a restaurant was beyond our capabilities!!! The wait was about 30 minutes - the restaurant is huge - very deceptive. We had a wonderful meal - really worth the wait. The mini hamburgers were delicious as was the camembert. Potato Bravas was also very good. There was a good range of tapas to choose from and a good selection of well priced wine. The service was good and efficient. When the bill came it was 112 euros for 4 of us and we had lots to eat and a couple of bottles of wine. We enjoyed it so much that we actually tried to go back the next day (Sunday) for lunch but it was even more busy and the wait was about 1 1/2 - 2 hours so sadly we didn't stay. Would definitely recommend Cerveceria Catalana as a great place to eat with delicious food and very well priced.
4928,28-04-2012 ,5.0,"Visited on the recommendation of the hotel we were staying at - so glad we did. It's a surprisingly big restaurant/bar but was absolutely rammed, with a constant flow of people trying to get in for a table. If you're looking for a more traditional old worldy bar this isn't the place, but it had a charm of its own, especially in and around the bar area where I would chose to sit on my next visit. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for our table at the bar, jostling for space with a beer, but it felt longer as we watched all the various dishes going out - they all looked unbelievably mouth watering. The food lived up to expectations when we eventually sat down, offering a variety of non oily (!) dishes. The octopus and the calamari were particularly good. Service was brisk and efficient - it had to be to keep up with the demand. Would definitely recommend and will return next time I'm in town. "
4929,28-04-2012 ,5.0,The staff here were superb especially the lady on front of house bookings - the place was packed but she was so calm and very welcoming. She even remebered us the next which was amazing given the number of people who had been served in that time.We were recommended the Catalana by a couple of guys in a bar and we were so pleased to have met them. Yes there was a wait the first night but a glass of wine for 1.60 from a very cheery bar tender helped with that!! You must try the skewered prawns they are fantastic.We went back the next day and were not disappointed although the waiter that time did give us the impression he wanted our table! Wont stop us going back though.Briliant! Barbara and Linda
4930,24-04-2012 ,4.0,Once accomodated (it takes 30 minutes and no reservatiuon possible) the experience of tapas is great: timely served and tasty
4931,23-04-2012 ,5.0,Haven't been here for about six years but it's still a wonderful place to eat.A short walk from the Paseo de Gracia and you are in food heaven. Love the montaditos especially the ones with gambas. The service is fast and very good and where else can you buy a very decent glass of red wine for almost the same price as a bottle of water i.e. 2 Euros!
4932,23-04-2012 ,5.0,One of the best in Barcelona! Prices are ok service as well. A must go in Barca
4933,22-04-2012 ,5.0,We loved the food and the ambiance. lots of people. nice tapas.
4934,20-04-2012 ,5.0,"The tapas in this place is amazing! My friend and I ordered loads off the menu plus a bottle of rose and dessert. The whole lot came to about 50 euros. Can't be beaten on value for money (2.50-6 euros per plate), excellent service, cool atmosphere or the gorgeous food! "
4935,20-04-2012 ,5.0,Great food everything so fresh! Count with 30 to 40 minutes to get a table! 
4936,20-04-2012 ,5.0,"Based on the recommendation of our awesome tour guide Andrea (from Discovery Walk Barcelona), we came here a bit early for some lunch. GOOD CALL! The place was packed by the time we left and we know why. Excellent tapas, smooth service and just a fantastic atmosphere. We sat at the bar on the left after coming in, and were well attended by Pepe, who had that bar running like a clock! And then... And then... And then... They brought out the paella of the day. Holy Heck...delicious. Pepe was scooping it onto plates and handing it out so fast we had to wait another 20 minutes for the next one to come out to get some. And one of the special tapas of the day was fried artichoke heart slices. They were pricey (for a tapa) but probably one of the best tapas I ate all week! Well played, Catalana, Well Played."
4937,19-04-2012 ,5.0,We were here 5 years ago. It has been renovated since. Lots of space. Well designed. Friendly staff. But the food is what keeps us coming back. We know we are going to get lovely tapas. The extensive menu means that we can come back and try something new. 
4938,19-04-2012 ,5.0,"A little bit of the beaten track, this restaurant is rammed full of local people which is always a good sign.We tried to dine without a reservation at 2000pm on a Tuesday night, no chance ! We persisted by having a few beers and finally we gained standing up access to one of the tapas bars and we were not disappointed by the freshly prepared gambas king prawns on crostini (heavenly), mini fillet steak, mini hamburgers which were amazingly tasty and cute, green peppers were OK and the coated camembert was superb.If you want genuine, superbly cooked Tapas, you must give this place a go, but be prepared to wait !"
4939,19-04-2012 ,5.0,"We had lunch in this restaurant two days running - it was so good ! Had to wait for ages but so worth it when we sat down !Very busy with a great buzz about it !The daily tapas menu was brilliant ,we tried lots of new dishes, they were all very tasty and well presented.delicious - efficient, friendly waiting staff,can,t wait to go back !"
4940,18-04-2012 ,5.0,"amazing crab salad. great atmosphere great taste. simple food, and very affordable. "
4941,18-04-2012 ,4.0,"Spent a few hours in Barcelona , was recommended this tapas bar by a colleague , very nice place , loved the interior , atmospare great , menu good with a huge selection of tapas , must try foie gras and Roquefort , egg and potato tapas , bread with tomatoes and garlic , actually , everything was nice ! 5 people , two rounds of drinks huge selection of tapas + dessert and coffee €23 p/p , worth it ! Will come back on my next visit ! "
4942,16-04-2012 ,5.0,Great tapas!No bookings so head up not too late and register your name on the list inside. Then get a drink and be ready to wait a good 45 minutes or more depending on business...The tapas are pretty much all good here.Wash them down with an 'Enate'.
4943,16-04-2012 ,4.0,"Went here after being in Barcelona for a few days and trying to find cheap deals with the tourist restaurants but ultimately getting ripped off. Went to this place on the tripadvisor recommendations and was not disappointed. Had to wait for about 15mins as it was packed on a Monday night but was not a problem. Once seated had good service and a steady supply of tapas. Had enough tapas to fill us along with dessert and a bottle of wine between. Everything came to €40 between the two of us and it really was the best meal we had in Barcelona. It's just a shame we didn't realise that this place was excellent value before our last night. Excellent value, would recommend to a friend. "
4944,16-04-2012 ,3.0,"When I lived in Barcelona five years ago, this was one of my favorites. Now it seems to have slipped. The food remains pretty good, but it feels more and more like a tourist trap now. The service appears designed more on getting you out the door than anything else. Hard to blame them with these lines, which are long. There are probably much better options nearby."
4945,14-04-2012 ,5.0,"We were lucky to find a table outside as folk were queuing out of the doors and the food lived up to its popularity. There was a large tapas selection, some slightly unorthodox but worth a try, and all was reasonably priced. We ordered too much and our bill, with a glass of wine, only came to 40 euros. The staff were friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a visit."
4946,14-04-2012 ,5.0,"Very nice place! not expensive, good food, nice atmosphere! It can be, crowded but don't hesitate to wait for a table, really worth! :)"
4947,14-04-2012 ,5.0,"The two best tapa places we went to was Cerveceria Catalana and Cal Pep, both wonderful. This seems to be the most popular with locals. We went mid- week in April around 9:30 p.m. and found the crowd waiting all Spanish speaking. The concierge at our hotel told us that it is the favorite of her and her friends, and I believe it. When we went we were told the wait for tables would be a least an hour, and the place is large with an eating area on the sidewalk. We managed to get a seat at the bar with just a short wait, and thoroughly enjoyed both the food and the electric atmosphere. If we return to Barcelona, we will definitely return to Cerveceria Catalana."
4948,13-04-2012 ,4.0,Excellent tapas. We went there at about 13.00 hours and didn't have to wait for a table. But we also could see that the place is very crowded and full of tourists (as we were). Must be a reason for it and that is the value for money-thing. We didn't mind the crowd and ate very well.
4949,12-04-2012 ,4.0,"We went there by the recommendation of our hotel the first night in Barcelona. Catalana does not take reservations so the waiting time can be very long. We went around 5.30 p.m. so we did not have to wait. You heard more English in this place than anything else so it is obviously very popular among tourists. We did not see any locals around us and for us this is quite big letdown. Food was absolutely fine but we had similar tapas later everywhere else so we did not feel any urge to go back there. If you are there and there is a long waiting line, consider going to Barcelona Center Hotel restaurant which is a block away on Mallorca. We had there a special offer which was 3 course menu for 16.50 euros and it was very tasty with a lot of local flavors and quite big portions. After Catalana it seemed like a great value for money."
4950,10-04-2012 ,5.0,We gave this restaurant a skip 3 nights running because of the wait for a table and ended up eating bad food at other restaurants. On the 4th night we endured the 45 minute wait for a table and it was well worth it. Overall I found the food in Barcelona to be very mediocre but this restaurant get it right and the price is very very reasonable too!
4951,10-04-2012 ,4.0,"I was in Barcelona on business and asked the two people there who work for me to choose somewhere for us to eat out which was 'local' in terms of food but not too 'flashy'. We went on a Monday night and got there at about 8, but there was already a queue. So we put our name down and had a beer, the wait was about 20 minutes, which was what we hads been told so I was happy with that. It always helps to have locals with you or to ask their opinion as they know what is best on the menu and any specialities you may not consider. The food itself was excellent and worth the short wait."
4952,9-04-2012 ,5.0,"Hands down the best place we ate in Spain! Lovely Sanghria, gorgeous but simple food and very reasonably priced!!! The only problem is that if you decide to go between half two and 4pm at the weekends you could be waiting for over an hour! There's a reason this place is so busy!!!"
4953,8-04-2012 ,3.0,"We went to this particular Tapas restaurant because of the reviews here on TripAdvisor and by recommendation of a friend. After waiting 45 minutes for a table outside along the street (the inside wait was almost 2 hours) we enjoyed about 10 different dishes, all of which were nicely prepared but it was far from the epicurean experience we expected. Overall, this was no better than several places we ate at during our fortnight in Spain and not as wonderful as others.Be careful not to let your waiter overorder for you. For example we wanted to share a grilled prawn dish and he said it was only one piece so he ordered three. Actually each order had four nicely sized shrimp on a skewer.During our wait and seated at the tables next to us, both of which turned over during our meal, we only encountered foreigners. It appears that the locals know better places to eat."
4954,7-04-2012 ,4.0,"The food was good, the service was just as good. The wait beforehand left all certainly ready to eat. The waiter offered good advice on our decisions. The only slight downfall was the man who was trying to sell lottery tickets whilst we tried to eat. "
4955,7-04-2012 ,5.0,We went on Saturday afternoon and waited an hour and it was worth every minute. Every dish was fresh and flavorful. The salmon was fresh and some of the best we have every had. The tuna pasta salad was flavorful and tasty as well. We had children so after an hour wait they needed to eat fast and all the tapas came right out so that completed our great experience. We will go back and we are only here for 5 days!
4956,6-04-2012 ,5.0,"Bumped into this place today, just down the road from our hotel. What a find. Had to wait, of course, so ordered a couple of beers and stood around until a couple left. Sat n the left at the counter, where all the seafood was. Superb razor clams, baby squid and BIG prawns. Will go back tomorrow to try the rest!Don't go. You'll only make the queue longer for the rest of us!"
4957,6-04-2012 ,4.0,"Good food and nice people, but very crowded. Our waiter was only speaking poorly English."
4958,5-04-2012 ,4.0,"This is a great tapas joint located near the Passeig de Gracia, a few blocks from La Pedrera/Casa Mila. It is crazy packed every evening, with people queuing up for wine (very good selection), beer (decent), and tapas (excellent). Since I had an injured foot at the time of our visit, we waited for a table rather than crush in to the central aisles of the restaurant as most people did. We only waited 20 minutes or so for a table on the sidewalk, and there we had excellent service and followed the recommendations of our very helpful waiter - everything we ordered was delicious, from the fried whitebait-type fish, to the artichokes, to their crazy-good fried egg over French fries. The house wines were delicious and the bill ludicrously small (at least by California standards). We went back for lunch and found the scene much quieter but the food still top notch."
4959,5-04-2012 ,5.0,This place lives up to the reviews. I'm a solo traveller and was placed up at the counter. It was easy to fall into conversation with the people next to me. The food was lovely and I couldn't believe the price!! I'm going to try to go back tomorrow.
4960,5-04-2012 ,5.0,"My son and I wanted to expirience the famous Spanish tapas, which Cerveciria Catalana lives up to fully. Cured ham, cheeses, salted pebbers, shrimp, and their famous mini burgers and mini hotdogs."
4961,2-04-2012 ,5.0,This is a wonderful restaurant - great ambiance and good value. Try the fried artichokes and the veal on baguette.
4962,2-04-2012 ,5.0,"Tapas is an ideal meal for all, not too much and plenty of choice, at Cerveceria, I sat at the bar and ordered a couple of familiar dishes, after a couple, some one recommended another sea food, dish and I had another glass of Torres, a chat another dish and so on, a really pleasant evening, and my Spanish is lousy, but a relaxed pleasant enviroment, and the price was unbelievable, I had to check they hadn't missed any plates - great value, proper food proper service."
4963,2-04-2012 ,5.0,"Simply good food. Unbelievably busy! We put our name on the list and walked around for 45 min. Returned and waited another 10 min. Oh so WORTH it! I was very happy we decided to stick it out, even though we were starving and tired. Go early but be prepared to wait. (I think they are open all day long.) Best Tortilla (egg, potato & onion) I've had in all of Spain...a must! Pimienta Padron (grilled/fried peppers, salted but not spicy)...delicious! Amazing Fried Artichoke slices! Lots of seafood, too. The wait staff are extremely helpful with menu choices, very friendly and super efficient. Great value for quality, delicious food. (FYI, There are tables inside beyond the bar...it is quite large inside.)"
4964,31-03-2012 ,5.0,"I had one lunch last week here. I had to wait only few minutes before I got a table for 4. Great atmosphere, nice sangria and very tasty tapas and flautas. We paid 60 euro for 4 and it was quite reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area. Worthy to eat here!"
4965,30-03-2012 ,5.0,This place was suggested by a staff member in our B&B. She did not steer us wrong. We loved it so much we went twice!I'd suggest the Potatoes Bravas and the Artichokes (my favorites).
4966,30-03-2012 ,4.0,This place was our first stop in Barcelona. We didn't know what to order when we got in so we sat at the counter and just pointed at items to order. The guy behind the counter was very helpful and described what we had picked and helped us pair a beer with the food. The cheese covered by almonds and topped with marmalade was outstanding....the gambas (shrimp) were grilled to perfection. We sat with a coupld of locals who engaged in converstation with us and gave us some ideas of places to see. Great experience.
4967,30-03-2012 ,4.0,"In Barcelona you can eat taps everywhere, but here the quality was excellent. Our hotel owner recommended this place for us, there was long queue but it was worth of waiting."
4968,30-03-2012 ,5.0,"We actually went here twice while in Barcelona. Our first night we had calamari, mini cheeseburger & hotdog, the crispy fries with sauce & egg (our favorite), and a salad. It was all very good and our waitress was helpful as well. We found the dessert Crema Catalana a delight to end the night. The second time, we went the waitress was actually a bit moody (not the same one as the other night) and we found ourselves trying to avoid her more than ask for her advice. We got some different items that night that were all superb. The rest of the staff was very helpful & each night we met some nice people sitting by us. Would highly recommend this place & that you go a bit early, the line is long and the wait can be over an hour around 20:00 (but so worth it!)"
4969,26-03-2012 ,5.0,"We were introduced to Cerveceria Catalana in 2009 and had a great evening there so we went back last March. It didn't disappoint us except for the huge crowd waiting to snap a chair or a table. The food was superior to what you'll find elsewhere, especially near the ramblas and the service, despite the crowd, fast and efficient. We'd highly recommend this place!"
4970,24-03-2012 ,5.0,"Brilliant food, great value. We ate here twice and second time arrived slightly earlier than the locals which meant we avoid all the rush. Good tip - If you arrive and there is a queue, don't be shy but walk to the front to give your name to the front desk, or you'll just stand there with all those in the know putting their name down before you. Great fresh food well cooked. Don't forget to ask what's on the dishes of the day, like the paella or rice as it's beautifully cooked. Make it a place to go to, you won't be disappointed."
4971,23-03-2012 ,5.0,"Quick service,great sangria,excellent food and desserts, great mini hamburgers. Must visit!!!"
4972,23-03-2012 ,5.0,"Excellent food, great drinks and the staff are very helpful, happy paying a little more for the tapas here, looks freash and tastes fresh. We went and had to wait for 30mins, so had some drinks and snacks at the bar... generally worth the wait!"
4973,22-03-2012 ,5.0,"There was a bit of a wait for seats when we got there (1.30pm) but we put ourselves on a list for an outside table (it was sunny) and then got a couple of beers and just watched the food arriving at other tables. Once we got seated we ordered almost exclusively by pointing at things on other people's tables that looked good. We weren't disappointed.We ate and drank on and off for a couple of hours (with no pressure to hurry, despite it still being busy) and the bill was under 40€ for the two of us."
4974,20-03-2012 ,4.0,"The three of us got to the restaurant at 8:30pm on Friday and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. Fortunately for us, the wait was only 25 minutes and we were eating by 9pm. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The eggs on fries (I believe it was Calbresa style?) is a must-try. "
4975,18-03-2012 ,4.0,"Nice restaurant, great house wine, big menu, and friendly service. I would recommend waiting for a spot on the patio if the weather allows, and just go town on the menu. Most of the dishes are big enough for two or three to share, and they were all pretty tasty. Reasonably priced as well."
4976,17-03-2012 ,5.0,"Everything we had here was just superb! The presentation is excellent, and the food is delicious. The menu is a little pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth."
4977,17-03-2012 ,5.0,"My husband and I visited this restaurant for lunch just before we flew back home. There were a few tables of people when we got there and the restaurant got very busy within half an hour. The food here is brilliant - spanish tapas, beautifully presented, extremely delicious. The restaurant also offers 'canapes' which may sound like very small portions, but they are quite big for a canape and so are also good value.We'd recommend the crispy camembert, prawn skewers and fish skewers.There is a good selection of beers available - and quite a few are not available in the UK which makes it more impressive.One regret I have is that we didn't have time to try the paella! We'll save that for our next Barcelona visit!"

What a temptation stay right in front of them!Do not miss that place in the heart of Eixample neighborhood, between one and other Modernist attraction."
4979,16-03-2012 ,5.0,"One of my favorite resturaunt experiences. The vibe, the service, and the food were outstanding. My wife, Debbie, picked this from reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. She made the perfect choice. All of us loved it."
4980,15-03-2012 ,5.0,"Around 7-8 years ago I used to come here everytime i was in Barcelona (often) and thought it was the best tapas place in the city. then I didnt go for a few years until last week. I was a bit apprehensive about going back after 6 years - was it going to be as good? was it going to disappoint and murk the great memories?Getting there was a bit of a shock as they have refurbished the place and it looks very sleek standard place that could be in any fancy cosmopolitan city - sadly lost a bit of the great spanish character. But the food, drinks, service and atmosphere lives on!!!! every single tapa was perfect! great flavours. Went there two nights in a row and will be sure to come back next time I am in town!!"
4981,15-03-2012 ,3.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is in the tourist books so it gathers quite a crowd. For that reason we went only once in our 5 day trip although several people recommended it as the best tapas place in Barce. The place is nicely decorated and I loved the bathrooms (hehe) but I hate crowds. The food was tasty and good but not as good as I was expecting based on the hype. Why? Dont know. A good thing was they have imported beer. The unfiltered belgian beer goes great with the cuttlefish and calamari. I would go again for brunch, not dinner."
4982,14-03-2012 ,4.0,"This place was hopping on a Monday night around 8! We had called ahead and been told they weren't taking reservations so with a party of 7 decided to just try our luck, and were able to get in without too much trouble, although the place was definitely busy. We enjoyed the seafood tapas especially, and the dry Manchego. We had a few small kids in our group and the atmosphere was loud and easygoing enough that we all felt comfortable."
4983,14-03-2012 ,5.0,"Simply the best Tapas restaurant I have ever been to. I have been here on two separate occasions before this visit to Barcelona and it is now even better then before, in fact we ate here 2 out of 3 evenings.Highlights; Prawn Skewers (I ate 3 portions one night!), Thinly sliced Potato with Fried Egg sooooo good & Veal, the freshly made Sangria is also excellent.You will need to be prepared to wait for a table, no more then 1 hour, but its great enjoying a drink and eyeing up every bodies food to get your taste buds going.This place is seriously good, I cant recommended it highly enough!Oh and both meals cost under 50 Euros including drinks."
4984,14-03-2012 ,3.0,"Nice place with nice food. But extremely hectic all over the place, wich transferred to all the staff. Felt we had no time to relax and almost pressured to leave as soon as we finished eating."
4985,13-03-2012 ,4.0,"Great food, lots of unique tapas dishes. A bit too crowded and the staff could have been more friendly, but it was still a great place."
4986,13-03-2012 ,4.0,"I arrived on a Saturday at 2.30 and this place was packed with a 20 minute wait. Platters are piled high with different tapas to get your mouth watering. When we sat at our table it felt more like a TGI Fridays than a hip Spanish tapas place. Perhaps the vibe is better at the bar. Regardless, the food was quite good."
4987,12-03-2012 ,3.0,"This used to be such a great place! But in the last 2 years, the quality has dropped.It is still very poplar and you will have to wait to get a table, but I think the quality has dropped significantly from when this place was really hopping.The outside seating is nice, and the wait staff is fair to good... but every hotel tells their patrons to go here for tapas, so... I think the quality is sinking. Same with Ciutat Condal. It may even be the same owner- I think it is. Both have dropped precipitously in their quality.Still a great environment tho... and still some locals... so maybe i am being overly critical. But I remember the first time I ate there ... i was jumping with joy! Now... eh... I may be picky, but I believe many restaurants in Barcelona are starting to use inferior olive oil and I don't know what... industrial butter... or something. The freshness and beautiful subtle flavors are disappearing... at least from SOME of the restaurants... I still say go to Blau, Tres, Rene's, and if you really want to treat yourself, go to Cinc Sentis- You'll be in heaven."
4988,12-03-2012 ,5.0,"amazing food,amazing service, everything was beautifull."
4989,12-03-2012 ,5.0,"I remembered this place from a couple of years ago where we accidentally wandered around and found a place that was so packed, we had to try it! Squeezing ourselves in at the bar, we didn't regret it and came back another time to sample some more of the huge delicious menu. This time around I came looking back for this place, a real favorite with locals, and found it just as packed and just as yummy. Weather you're alone, a couple, with friends or family, it has great atmosphere, really nice tapas and very reasonably priced for the quality. Since you are very likely to wait for your seat (it's worth the wait!), position yourself strategically in front of the service area where they pop out the tapas fast and furious. There's nothing like eating with your eyes. Have fun!"
4990,11-03-2012 ,5.0,"Wonderful Tapas. Our first meal in Barcelona, it was a great introduction to the food. Ordered an assortment of Tapas and everything was great. It was recommended by everyone. Great wait staff who were attentive and understanding of Americans."
4991,11-03-2012 ,5.0,"We ate here our first night in Barcelona and I had to force myself to go to other places - I would have been happy eating every meal here. This was our first time ordering tapas and our waiter was helpful and patient as he answered all our questions. I loved the sangria and all the tapas we ordered were delicious.We arrived early (around 6:30), per the suggestions on this website, and were glad we did. When we left around 8ish, the place was packed and people were waiting outside.I will go back here again when I visit Barcelona in the future!"
4992,10-03-2012 ,1.0,"What a disappointment. We were really looking forward to eating here. Heard such great reviews. Don't get me wrong. The meal we had was perfectly fine tonight but absolutely not deserving of the high rating it seems to get here. The tapas were fresh but really nothing special about it. Quite bland. We had a meal last night in a place called bubo, .... It's in the gothic quarter and was far far superior tapas... Best I've ever had. It renewed my faith in tapas! Deserts to die for also...I feel I have to give a bad score to Cerveceria Catalana restaurant tonight as it has an unbelievablly high score from so many. They must have great marketing people working for them, I do not understand??!! Apologies to Cerveceria Catalana again, the meal was absolutely fine but really nothing out of the ordinary. P.s I'm not an overly fussy punter... I just can't understand what all the fuss is about here!!!"
4993,9-03-2012 ,4.0,"I used to have lunch here about 10 years ago when the company I worked for had an office round the corner. Several jobs and many years later when my colleague told me we would go to a tapas place in a cerveceria, my memory light pinged on and I wondered if it could possibly be this one. Of the many hundreds of restaurants and bars in Barca, she had picked one I already knew and liked.The place has been tarted up fairly recently - gone is the old faded wood and air of past times to be replaced by shiny new counters and tiny tables. We squeezed through the door at about 8.15 - unfashionably early for Barcelona but packed tight with diners and drinkers. The 'lady with the list' took our names, told us it's be a wait of 20 mins and then called us about 5 minutes later.Food was excellent - we ate cipirones (not the best I've had), finely sliced and fried artichokes, two types of mushrooms, spring onions 'a la plancha' with tomato and nut sauce and more things I can't even remember. The bill for two very full people and two beers was 42 euros - one of the best bargains in Barca where very average food can easily cost twice that amount."
4994,8-03-2012 ,4.0,"This is a good tapas place located in a nice district of Barcelona. It's quite popular and can be quite crowded. We got there around 8pm and we ended up waiting 30 mins or so for a table which is not too bad but people right after us ended up waiting for 1 hour. The entrace/bar area was very crowded with not much space to stand. You definitely want to get there early if you want a reasonable wait time. Once we had the table, it felt a little rushed with multiple waiters flying around and the waiter forgot one of our orders. The food was pretty good with good value and there was a good selection of wine and beer. Definitely worth a visit but if you prefer a quiet dinner, there are plenty of other tapas places in Barcelona."
4995,8-03-2012 ,4.0,"I was speaking with a friend of mine on the phone while on my way to Barcelona from Girona airport and as soon as he heard that I was in Barcelona he recommended Cerveceria Catalana. He didn't really remember where this place was since he had just stumbled upon it but he insisted that it was a place that I should really try to find and visit.While initially I thought that this was just one more recommendation since a lot of my friends loved Barcelona and everybody had a favourite place, I soon realised that fate dictated that my first tapas in this city would be in this place. The apartment that I was renting for my short stay was just across the street from Cerveceria Catalana and it turned out to be one of my most interesting finds in the 5 days spent in this wonderful city.First of all it is very easy to find since it is on Mallorca Street just off Rambla de Catalunya. The place has a very airy and modern feel with young unpretentious people enjoying their drinks and tapas either on the bar or its large wooden tables. We decided to sit outside despite being December since it was a very pleasant night and (most importantly) the place was packed at 21.00 when we got there.The waiters immediately came to assist us suggesting a nice and very affordable bottle of cava while we were going through the menu. Being our first night in Barcelona we didn't have much experience about tapas and didn't really know what to order. We enjoyed though the patatas bravas, the flutas (small toasted baguettes), jamon tapas and a plate with grilled aubergine with red sauce and goat cheese, which was just incredible. I didn't really like the fried calamari since the batter was covering the taste of the calamari, which was maybe because of the fact that the calamari was so finely shredded. We finished off with a crema catalana (some kind of a catalan creme brule), which was the discovery of the trip for me.The bill (including the aforementioned bottle of cava) came at around EUR 45, which I consider very affordable.To conclude, me and my partner really loved cerveceria catalana and we would definitely recommend this lovely place!"
4996,8-03-2012 ,5.0,"We had such an amazing time there! We sat at the bar, and enjoyed... Great food, such a pleasant and devoted service, and what about the atmosphere! A night to remember, that's for sure!"
4997,7-03-2012 ,4.0,"Having sampled Tapas through out the United States (see other reviews), it was time to check out the Real Deal in Barcelona, Spain. Needless to say, there are many, many Spanish restaurants through out Barcelona, but some are truely better than others, and Cerveceria Catalana is one of the better ones. Made it there for lunch (same menu are supper) and glad I did. While there is both inside and outside seating, due to the time of year and chill, I opted for the inside seating. Inside, the environment was very warm and welcoming and the waiters presented the Daily Menu (in Spanish), which is you have had any Spanish you can make out a good portion of, but when they when they realized I was an English speaker (how did they guess ;-D), they provided me with an abbreviated English (AN) menu. One thing to be aware of is that the English menu is the 'standard' Tapas fare, but the daily Tapas menu changes daily and is not translated. I was able to 'interpret' most of the Daily Tapas menu and the waiter was happy to confirm or clarify the interpretation. The sea food salad was excellent (they don't seem to remove the sand-vein in the whole shrimp in Spain in general), the grilled (semi-hot) peppers were the best I have had, with just a touch of salt and olive oil, and the asparagas/mushroom combination was superb. Don't forget to sample the local ham, it is of course hard to mess this one up. The cold dishes were delivered cold and the warm/hot dishes all came straight from the kitchen window to the table HOT (see other review re Tapa Tapa).As usual, when you enter the Tapas bar, there are plates and plates of Tapas prepared and sitting out on the bar for you to look over and sample if this is your desire while taking a drink at the bar/counter. I found that just wandering in the various Tapas Bars was a good way to explore and see if there was anything that I liked.Cerveceria is close to the Passeig de Garcia/Mallorca intersection, and there are also a number of local Bar Tapas Restaurants just south of Mallorca along Passeig de Garcia. One is located at Passeig de Garcia, 71 and although I never did figure out the name, it is THE place to go for the local ham, with the various hams all hanging down over the bar area that the server is more than happy to explain to you . .Finally the price, be aware (see review of Tapa Tapa) that the 'tourist traps' generally charge significantly more than the local Bar Tapas as I spend 23 Euro's for 4 plates and a drink here."
4998,6-03-2012 ,5.0,"the best tapas ever, highly recommened. the solomio is a must try"
4999,6-03-2012 ,5.0,Every time I plan a visit to Barcelona I make sure to allocate enough time for at least one meal in Cerveceria Catalana. Every dish I have ever tried was brilliant and I must have tried the majority of dishes they have on their menu by now. it is definitely worth the wait of 2 hours and as it is so centrally located you can always hop in to book your place on the waiting list and stroll around until the time comes.
5000,4-03-2012 ,5.0,Amazing food. I come here as much as possible. Love everything! You can't go wrong.
5001,2-03-2012 ,5.0,"I recently went to Cerveceria Catalana while in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress event. The ambiance was very fun and lively. We arrived at about 7:45 which was perfect. Unlike many places in Barcelona, this place filled up much earlier. Fifteen minutes later the wait would have been at least 30 minutes. Everything we had was outstanding. The fried egg on shredded potatoes was a specialty and deserving of a try. We tried a half dozen things and all were great. The price was pretty reasonable too--less than 25 euros for each of us.The outdoor seating was lovely, but a little cold for us the way we were dressed."
5002,2-03-2012 ,5.0,"We visited this Tapa bar and restaurant. The food and drinks there are awesome. Be careful if you go late, you could have a 45 mts wait, but it is worth it. A must visit for anyone going to Barcelona."
5003,27-02-2012 ,5.0,"Not much to say except lively atmosphere, super friendly, helpful staff, wonderful tapas and unbelievably good prices. Don't miss it!"
5004,27-02-2012 ,4.0,We dined here based on recommendations from friends who had been. We have a nine year old so we went a bit early (6:30pm) and had no problems getting a table. Food was good (not amazing) and restaurant was fairly quiet (still some empty tables) when we arrived. Service was perfectly nice. By the time we left around 8:00pm was a 30 minute wait and bar was hopping. We walked up from our hotel on La Ramblas which was on the edge of being a bit far (we were probably over hungry).
5005,27-02-2012 ,5.0,"Liked - Price, quality, environmentNo Liked - Nothing"
5006,27-02-2012 ,4.0,"I spent a few days in Barcelona last week, my second trip there. My friend from NYC who now lives in Barcelona took me to Cerveceria Catalana for dinner. We knew it is usually very busy so we went at 7pm. We ordered some tapas and local beer and were served promptly and properly. The food is very good as is the atmosphere. Total bill was just 25 Euro. Highly recommended."
5007,26-02-2012 ,3.0,"This place has a great buzz with loads of locals and tourists filling the bar area and outside, whilst waiting for tables. The food was good, although not the best we had in Barcelona."
5008,26-02-2012 ,4.0,"You need to go early if you dont like waiting.. the place is great but its almost full all the time with tourists and locals..waiting time depends (inside , outside)(number of persons) etc.the place is always full so its not a romantic place for whom looking for one :Dwe tried lot of dishes all were just wonderful.. I love food :)We asked about some recommendations for dishes and we order others so if you are like 5 or 6 persons you need at least two order two eachSo when you are in Barcelona be sure that you do a visit to Cerveceria Catalana."
5009,25-02-2012 ,4.0,"We were prepared for a long wait, so we weren't surprised that the wait was still over an hour. We finally sat at 11:30pm and the food was pretty great. There were a few dishes that were fantastic and a few that were just good, but overall the quality of the food was excellent. The service was okay, but with a bit of attitude. Overall, I would recommend, but try to go on the early-side if you don't want a long wait."
5010,24-02-2012 ,5.0,"We ate in 4-5 highly rcomended tapas bars but this is the best. Sit at the bar and order what you see. There are a few things you should not forget in the menu too. Price is very convenient. Eat all you can -we challenged our limits- with 0,5-1 lt sangria and the maximum you will pay per person is 25-30 euros.We went there 3-4 times. "
5011,23-02-2012 ,5.0,"This is the third time I have visited this restaurant & cannot find any faults. The food is amazing, service friendly & although you have to wait for a table due to the restaurants popularity its so worth it. While waiting its a opportunity to people watch & take in the great atmosphere."
5012,23-02-2012 ,5.0,"My and my friends ate here 3 dinner over 4 nights in Barcelona. Recommend you should go with group, you can order many dishes and share together. We ate over 20 different dishes here in 3 dinner :D."
5013,23-02-2012 ,5.0,"Having visited many times before we were amased at how busy the Cerveceria Catalana had become. However, we were not disappointed with the food or the service. The range and quality of tapas is very good withprices for every pocket. With a bottle of wine and coffees it is hard to spend over 50 euros for two. We will be back next time we visit Barcelona."
5014,20-02-2012 ,4.0,"Seriously, the egg with the mini fries was the best thing I ever had in my whole life! I wish i could remember the name of the dish...The interior was dark and nothing special in my opinion. The waiters were friendly and service minded, the place was crowded but we managed to get a table right away. Definitely going here next visit in Barcelona."
5015,19-02-2012 ,5.0,"Good and fresh food, professional staff, excellent value for money. Good variety of food from fish to meat, from rice to desserts. Consider that i'm Italian and so I'm into eating well... This place alone is worth the trip to BCN. I've been in Barcelona for three days and I couldn't stop going there."
5016,19-02-2012 ,3.0,"I have been several times, the food is absolutely lovely and I confirm that. However my most recent experience was significantly worst in terms of service. I got there at 7,15 Pm which you would expect at least in Spain to be early enought to not have problems particularly since they do not accept reseverations.I was told that a table for 9 was available but only for maximum 1,30h.I asked why since they do not take reseverations and they did not want to explain. We ended up staying longer, I simply refused to leave as I was still eating. However they first started to look at us badly, then as soon as we finished they brought the bill. There was no tip left...."
5017,19-02-2012 ,5.0,"High quality products and nice cooked. I'm from Barcelona and I can say it's a really good place to have some tapas, may be a bit tourist but it happens when you do the things well."
5018,16-02-2012 ,3.0,"We had dinner here and I loved my food but my wife was so-so on hers. I ordered the prawn skewer and the fried baby squids (andaluz style) which melted in my mouth like butter. My wife thought the patatas bravas were good but the tortilla was like tasteless scrambled eggs. The service was decent but it was VERY bright in there (I almost put on my sunglasses because I felt like I was in an interrogation room). We had a 45-minute wait, which wasn't a problem because we knew to expect it. Aside from my wife's food and the loud/rushed vibe, our main problem was that it felt a bit touristy -- like they were churning out dishes one after another on conveyer belts. There wasn't an authentic vibe to the place and there were as many tourists as there were locals. So, if you want great food and don't need an authentic experience, you should go here. But, if you want something more true to the Catalan experience, I'd go somewhere else."
5019,9-02-2012 ,3.0,my wife and i kept looking at each other saying whats the big deal. razor clams were nasty and sandy. the mini hamburger and the bacon/cheese floutas were tasty. the fried mini peppers were the star. but the rest of the tapas were mediocre. go to Orios. that place rocked. oh we also ate the catalana creme (creme brulee). that was pretty good at CC.
5020,4-02-2012 ,5.0,No need to wait for a table; just grab the first available place at the bar. That way you can just point to what you want. Order a bottle of wine and order your tapas as you like. We went back again a second night to try new dishes. Excellent food at a very reasonable price.
5021,4-02-2012 ,5.0,"I was in Barcelona for four nights and ate dinner here 3 of those nights and not just because it was close to my hotel. The food and service are excellent; the atmosphere is energetic, the restaurant had an international crowd as well as a local crowd. A nice selection of tapas, beer and wine, menus are available in English and the servers also speak English if you want them to. If you want great tapas without spending a fortune, this is the place for you. "
5022,3-02-2012 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona, it's located around the hip area shopping area. Their tapas are well seasoned, the perfect size, and you MUST order the sangria, I'd say it's the best sangria I've ever tasted! Will definitely come back when I'm in Barcelona!"
5023,30-01-2012 ,5.0,"Cerverceria Catalana was recommended by the hotel concierge - and it lived up to its reputation. Definitely a modern stylish take on Tapas, expect a 50 minute wait for a table (plus the front of house team are super efficient and polite) simply due to the popularity.Once in enjoy the atmosphere - full of locals - and sample a great selection of Tapas. Enjoyed it so much that we ate their on two consecutive nights (50 min wait both times). Highly Recommended."
5024,26-01-2012 ,3.0,"We live in Barcelona and we often go to this place because the tapas are very tasty. But I guess this place has been advertised in many travel guides and it's getting very difficult to get a table now. It is always full at Spanish lunch time (1PM-4PM), Spanish dinner time (after 8PM), but also during tourists lunch&dinner time especially in Summer or Christmas time... It's a shame they don't accept reservations. To get a table easily you should go at noon for lunch or 7PM for dinner... Otherwise prepare for a degrading experience, waiting a looooong time in the street and possibly having to share a table with other people... This is just ridiculous. For God's sake, these are only tapas !!!"
5025,25-01-2012 ,4.0,"Modern design,central location,very good tapas.You can sit at bar and show to waiter what you want to eat."
5026,20-01-2012 ,4.0,"Hard to fault, the variety an the price was very good and the food, it was of a high quality! The decor was nice an the service not bad. All in all a great experience and I will go back next time I am in Barcelona!"
5027,17-01-2012 ,2.0,"What we expected was a simple inexpensive place to enjoy Spanish food. When we arrived the place was overcrowded and we were informed to wait 45 minutes, so we left and came after 40 minutes to be informed that we were late, which meant an extra 20 minutes wait. About the service: it was definitely the worst part for us. We asked for a selection of montaditos and the waiter stared at us in silence, we asked if he understood what we said and he said ""I did, but probably you didn't understand what you asked"". In my opinion, even if we asked for something very bizarre, it was unacceptable to have a waiter answer like that. If we hadn't been waiting for 1hr, we would have left at that point. About the food: some dishes, like calamarcitos romana, were enjoyable but most of the others, like everything in the ""surtido de tapas"", were plain and had that flavorless taste of overcooked dishes. All in all, 1hr to be seated, rude service, overcooked food."
5028,16-01-2012 ,5.0,"great in season and freshly prepared fantastic food, with local beer, great atmosphere - very busy - 40 mins until table was available but worth the wait"
5029,16-01-2012 ,5.0,"We were extremely impressed with the food. They have an extensive menu with very reasonable prices. We ate at this restaurant twice during our stay in Barcelona and would have eaten here again had we had more time. All of the food is nicely displayed and is very delicious. They have a great beer and wine menu too. The staff is wonderful and moves quickly. We cannot say enough about this restaurant, except for we hope we can eat here again. One of the best restaurants in Barcelona and not touristy."
5030,13-01-2012 ,4.0,"be prepared to wait a little as you cannot reserve a table and there always seems to be a queue,we got a table and after waiting by the bar we more or less new what we wanted after looking at the mounds of food on the bar ,but there are lots of extra things the waiter will inform you off.the kids also enjoyed it .i would deffinitley recommend but go early"
5031,12-01-2012 ,4.0,"The reception desk at the hotel is a bit of a gold-mine really since the staff are seasoned locals who where to go and where not to go. Yeah sure, they make the odd mistake but they've never sent to me to a dump of a joint so far!This is a great little place, nice warm ambience and I loved the outdoor sitout (for smokers too :)) with the heat lamps.Tried the assorted tapas, beer and a double espresso. Good, fresh and solid. EUR 25.00 including tip.At this point, I would like to express my heartfelt distress and frustration that the items on the ""assorted"" tapas plate was the same (Padreno peppers, croquettes, anchovies, shrimp, and clams) at all restaurants I tried!! :(Still tasted good.Good and friendly service."
5032,11-01-2012 ,4.0,"Go early! We arrived around 8pm and waited 45 minutes for a table. Food was good and the restaurant is very modern. We ordered the croquettes, shrimp skewers, and mini hamburgers. Everything was delicious! We left around 10 pm and the line appeared to be even longer than when we arrived."
5033,9-01-2012 ,4.0,"Expect a long wait if you haven’t booked for this stylish and modern tapas restaurant which was strongly recommended to me by a friend who used to live nearby.It’s not that expensive but no bargain either. There is a very extensive menu and the food is very fresh and well cooked, the staff are friendly and service is good.It was absolutely packed on a Sunday evening (a sign of its obvious popularity). I prefer somewhere a bit quieter and a bit more down to earth; nevertheless an excellent meal and a nice restaurant."
5034,8-01-2012 ,5.0,"This place is owned my same family and is comparable---nice big round tables for big groups. Get there early, is mobbed even on Monday nights!"
5035,6-01-2012 ,5.0,"Yes it is super busy. Yes you are likely to wait a little bitIt is all worth it!The tapas are fantastic. A lot of them are on the extensive menu, with a lot of specials every day.Make sure to look at the specials menu before completing your order. Even more, look around, you might discover new tapas on tables that attract your attention, ask.I have not had anything I did not like. Their ham and manchego are very tasty. The Padrón peppers were great also.It's proximity to the Rambla de Catalunya (a way under appreciated avenue for anyone that likes walking in Barcelona) is reason alone to go also.So go there, put your name on the list, go for a walk... Enjoy the area and furthermore, have a fantastic meal, you won't be disappointed (at least I don't think you will)."
5036,4-01-2012 ,4.0,Upscale and modern - hostess accomodating in light of us having no reservations. 
5037,4-01-2012 ,5.0,"There is a reason there is a line out the door at this place... It's a great value... very reasonably priced.The tapas is very good but I would not put it at the top I have ever had. But again, the prices are great! We had a decent bottle of vino for less than 12 Euros and ended up ordering more food than we could eat.Patience is required. You have to be willing to wait for a table or a space at the bar."
5038,3-01-2012 ,5.0,"came back here 3 times and enjoyed every single time.great sangria, great patatas bravas and excellent food altogether , not expensive"
5039,3-01-2012 ,5.0,"We have been there twice. It is just too good! For 20-25 Euros per person, we tried many montaditos, tapas and had beer and wine.Apparently, it is very touristy, but it is so good! - To get a table, you may wait around 30 minutes or so. - It is worth the waiting time."
5040,2-01-2012 ,5.0,Very good tapas place make sure you have time to wait for a table beacuse the wait around lunch is about 50 minutes! but its totally worth it. Also beware of pickpockets when eating outside.
5041,2-01-2012 ,5.0,"All the reviews were right, this is an unmissable restaurant. There was a queue when we arrived, and one when we left, but it was worth it.The seafood was excellent, jamon brilliant and the pa amb touquet an absolute triumph.Loved it - and decent value too. Not cheap but worth it. "
5042,29-12-2011 ,5.0,"As we are very regular visitors of Barcelona we are still trying out all the nice restaurants in town. We always go back to Cerveceria Catalana. Maybe we have been there a 100 times and were never disappointed. All our friends and family that have joined us several times are also always happy to go back. Excellent food and nice and efficient staff. Dont forget to ask for the daily tapas, these are written on a separate menu..."
5043,29-12-2011 ,5.0,"Great tapas! Must try - kebab prawns & cod! grilled squid is good too. Make sure you arrive early as the queue/wait can be more than an hour. In event that there's a queue, just add your name to list and walk around the nearby pedestrian-only avenue. There's also a Haagen-daas round the corner to have an ice-cream before dinner.As the place is so busy, service staff can be a little impatient sometimes in helping you with your order if you are new to the place. "
5044,27-12-2011 ,4.0,"We visited this place twice, once as a couple, and once a few days later hosting a business colleague. On our first visit the food, service, atmosphere and crowd were fantastic....the place has a real buzz and you will not be disappointed by the excellent choice of tapas. HOWEVER...on our second visit, while all of the above was still true, my wife and I got food poisoning from the Creme Caramel dessert. We are pretty sure is was the dessert because our guest did not eat the dessert and did not get sick. My wife and I were both violently ill. These desserts are stacked up on the counter in a pyramid, and on reflection, not very hygenic storage of food...especially dairy based food."
5045,27-12-2011 ,4.0,"Great tapas, price a bit high for portion size, good for groups and tourists. I often take friends and family who are visiting to this restauarant. They accomodate groups on short notice, though you may have to wait a while. Fri/Sat night wait is very long. Portions are a bit small as is the case in many of the most famous tapas bars in Barcelona."
5046,24-12-2011 ,5.0,"We went for an early dinner (around 7 pm)' and cully it was lready fairly crowded. We got a variety of tapas and beers and all were excellent, very traditional and reasonably priced. Would return if in Barcelona in the future!"
5047,22-12-2011 ,5.0,We discovered this place on our first trip to Barca in 2007 and we made certain to revisit this past November. We were not disappointed. The dining room has been renovated but the quality food and service remains the same. This place is very solid and I could eat here daily. Not an over the top experience but that suits me fine. This place is frequented by the locals more than tourists.
5048,22-12-2011 ,5.0,"We visited this restaurant in May 2011, but I doubt the quality of food and the atmosphere has changed much. We were walking around downtown Barcelona and notice this restaurant with big open windows, outside seating, and bustling crowd of people. We decided to go check it out and noticed that it was a huge Tapas bar and restaurant. It looked like the wait was going to take awhile, but when we put our name on the list it was only about 25 min; so we pulled up a seat at the bar and ordered some beer. They served the Estrella Clara there which is a lemon beer and perfect for a Sunday. Also at the bar they had most of their cold tapas right on display so you could see exactly what you were ordering, which actually made the decision quite hard! We got our table and ordered about 6 or so tapas which were all absolutley delicious; everything from omelette to the sardines tasted incredibly fresh. It definitley seemed like a place the locals try to go and not very touristy. We will be going back for sure the next time we visit Barcelona!!"
5049,21-12-2011 ,5.0,"Beautiful and modern place, the food is excellent, we tried the famous ""patatas bravas"" which are amazing."
5050,14-12-2011 ,4.0,"Recommended by our hotel as consistently good. We agree..all our tapas of good quality and lots of variety. Take your time ordering...look at the displays..look at the other tables...good value and we would eat here again...service very good and ""tourists"" given an even shake"
5051,11-12-2011 ,4.0,"Four people working together, went for dinner saturday night. We went early (17.30) but the place was quite busy even at that hour. Had some of today's specials, and struggled a bit since they were all listed in spanish. The waiter helped us translate with great patience. All tapas came in descent size and must be considered good value for money. Four people incl deserts and drinks at 80 euro! Recommended!"
5052,10-12-2011 ,4.0,We all loved that outside a tapas restaurant there was a statue of a German in Lederhosen! The tapas on the bar looked delicious and they were! The seasoned olives were tasty and I really liked the cod in butter sauce. Cerveceria carried many different beers and the Barcelona beer was great!
5053,7-12-2011 ,4.0,"First of all I have to say that I don't understand the bad reviews. I mean it's a tapas restaurant, at a decent level, with a high quality of commodities, great service and great ambience. If that isn't what you want, you should'nt go here. I've tried 10 or more of the highly reviewed tapas places in Barcelona, including at least 10 others recomended by local friends, and I would say that this one is in top 5.Not many surprices, but you'll get what you order, and it will be high quality. It's a busy place, so don't expect a lot of attention from the waiters, but they are quick and efficient!WIll come back, many times."
5054,6-12-2011 ,1.0,"one of the most famous place in Barcelona to eat Tapas! well don't believe people.It was one of the worst place I ever been ... It's 4 years I'm living in Spain, I'm a chef and I know tapas pretty well. I never found a tapas menu that boring.. it's seems to be in a country yard village bar.. but at the end pay attention !! for what you eat the bill is really EXPANSIVE!!! the quality is really low ! probably they are champions in opening cans there is nothing done a la minute that's why service is so fast and probably few things are done in the kitchen!!! don't fall in the trap to eat there because is famous... it's plenty of better tapas bar!!!!overall Rate: 0 !!!!"
5055,6-12-2011 ,5.0,This place was recommended to us by many people so we went. And we went there for 2 days during our 5-day stay in Barcelona. Sitting at the bar was so fun becuase you can just pick and choose whatever interests you. EVERYTHING was SO good!!!
5056,5-12-2011 ,5.0,"Great tapas restaurant and bar. Very popular place among locals and tourists - don´t expect to get a table that easily if you haven´t reserved. Serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Very good food and creative tapas. Huge selection of sea food tapas. It´s actually not so much a beer drinking place though, people come here for the food and the nice atmosphere. Very professional service, although sometimes a bit snobby. People stay here until the late hours, it closes around 1.30 am. A good 15 walk from the tourist areas and Placa Catalunya."
5057,4-12-2011 ,4.0,"Excellent choice in Barcelona. Good tapas. Service ""semi"" OK."
5058,30-11-2011 ,4.0,"Wide veriaty of tapas. Almost every dish turns out splendid. Don't miss the grilled iberico and make sure to mix some vegetables within your order. The service is fast and efficient. Like any other busy tapas on the tourist route, each dish is a little too expensive considering the small portion."
5059,30-11-2011 ,4.0,"well organised and wel furnitured tapas bar, with lots of seating places and every day tapas of the day selection, food is well seasoned and good quality"
5060,29-11-2011 ,5.0,"It was a great laugh just sitting there and listening to the jokes of the staff members - the best one is Antonio :)The food is typical Spanish and always fresh, good range of seafood, salads and tapas.Really recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner, especially if your hotel is nearby."
5061,26-11-2011 ,5.0,Truly the best restaurant I ate at while in Spain. Great food and service. Everything was tasty and fresh. The veal tapas was absolutely fantastic. Will definitely return while in Spain. 
5062,24-11-2011 ,5.0,"nice food in general a big variety of tapas and not only,good prices,and fast service"
5063,23-11-2011 ,5.0,"simply one of the best places to eat tapas in the world. very good, not expensive and well located - avoid going there on lunch/dinner time because it can be full"
5064,23-11-2011 ,5.0,"I have eaten at 3 of the top 10 on the tripadvisor list as well as some other highly rated restaurants in Barcelona. I would not hesitate to rank Catalana in the top 5. First of all, their selection is huge, much larger than most other places. They seem fairly authentic as well. Service is the quickest I've ever experienced. We had 20 different dishes on 2 different occasions, and did not have one bad item. At least 10 of these items were as good as top 10 restaurants on this list, and a good 5 dishes were better (and spectacular). Very popular with locals as well. On top of that, prices are very reasonable."
5065,23-11-2011 ,5.0,"We were staying near Universidad and this place was withing walking distance. It was also recommended in our Lonley Planet guide so thought we'd take a chance. It is a modern tapas bar - nice decor, friendly staff and very, very busy. We went early enough that we didn't have to wait for a table, but I can see how quickly queues would form. They have an extensive menu of tapas, ranging from the usual suspects to some quite bizarre specials. We had some excellent cava and each chose one tapas with a couple of smaller offerings out of curiosity. Ample food and excelent. The price for 4 of us with two bottles of wine came to just over 80 euros before tip."
5066,22-11-2011 ,5.0,"Good location. Interesting menu options. Nice place to people watch. Good atmosphere.The croquettes, mushrooms with garlic and olive oil, peppers, and flautas (ham and cheese) were very good. Tip when eating in Barcelona: Many of the restaurants (this one included) charge more to eat outside (up to 15% more). It’s great to sit outside and people watch but you need to be aware of it. It’s usually written in the menu but you have to be looking for it. Most of the restaurants charge less to sit and the bar followed by 10% more to sit inside and 15% more to sit outside. Another thing to watch out for is bread and olive charges. This happens in many locations in Europe. You sit down and they bring you bread or olives and then you get your bill and they charge you for them. Some of this bread ends up costing 4 euro per table."
5067,21-11-2011 ,4.0,"Very nice Taps selection. Had a great dinner.Not sure if it is outsdanding, but certainly enjoyable."
5068,19-11-2011 ,5.0,"Thus far this is the best place we have eaten at in Barcelona. Straight after arriving you see why the entrance is packed with people. The tapas look amazing; and that is not their only positive aspect. the taste is inredible as well. We were really not disappointed by the fantastic and friendly service, even though the place was packed. Patatas bravas were heavenly, the maynoaise and ketchup sauc sounds pretty standard, but the great thing is that you are in for quite a treat after having had the first few bites of the patatas; a very nice and spicy hint is added that make such a simple dish plain splendor. The magret de pato (duck liver) was exquisit, the chef clearly knows what he is doing. an absolute must to go to and have one of the best tapas in Barcelona. oh, and the price is also on the soft side, amounting to less than 18 euros per person including a drink or two, and a four euro tip. "
5069,18-11-2011 ,5.0,"First, Cerveceria Catalana is a busy restaurant. There are two wait lists - one for outside and one for inside. There is an alcohol bar and a tapas/alcohol bar. Getting a seat at the bar is one part timing, one part luck, and one part not looking the other guy in the eye as you go for the seat. The restaurant is very exciting and the service somehow manages to keep up with the bustle. From the manager at the door to the inside/outside wait list keepers, bar tenders and waitstaff - everyone runs on high octane but manages to keep it fun and enlightening. The tapas menu is extensive: fried peppers or artichoke hearts to hard sausage and cheese to duck liver pate - you'll get full long before you taste the same thing twice. The good news is that once you figure out the system and timing for getting a table/ bar seat, then you will have no problem visiting several times in one trip. Lastly, prices are very reasonable relative to some of the other tapas joints in the Capitol of Catalana..."
5070,17-11-2011 ,5.0,"We did have to wait quite long time for a table but the trick seems to be to put your name down, find out how long the wait is and go for a drink around the corner! The food and service were perfect. One of the cheapest wines (Chard/Sauv) was delicious and in fact the whole meal was very good value. We shared spanish omlette, fois gras & roquefort sandwich (flute), patatas bravas, prawns, mushrooms.... can't recommend it enough!"
5071,15-11-2011 ,4.0,"We (group of 6) went here twice during our stay in Barcelona. We had a fun table, crowded outside on the sidewalk. We chose to be outdoors due to the warm evening (in October!), The inside was jam packed both nights. We had to wait for a table both times but there was no problem drinking Cerveza and Sangria on the sidewalk! The food was delicious and the service good. A great way to start our first night in the wonderful city of Barcelona"
5072,15-11-2011 ,5.0,"Excellent choice of quality tapas. Good selection of beers and wines. This place is so popular that you need to beat the rush. Get in before 12 pm at lunch and before 7.30 pm at night or face a crowded bar area and no free tables. Later arrivals have to stand in the bar area, crowded like a football match, which eventually spills out onto the pavement outside. If you are prepared to walk another block to Passeig Gracia there is an alternative tapas bar/restaurant, Costa Gallego, which also has excellent tapas and a restaurant with fresh fish dishes. Catalana probably has a better range of tapas dishes but you have to put up with the crowds unless arriving early. This also applies to leaving the place. In a group of seven we arrived just after 7 pm and found a table to accommodate us. Two hours later we had to fight our way out through the bar area and then through the crowds on the pavement outside. Get there early if you don't like crowds or go to Costa Gallego."
5073,13-11-2011 ,4.0,"This is the newer restaurant from the owner of Ciudad Condial. Both were really good, this restaurant had large tables which made sharing easy. The more contemporary atmosphere was nice but less authentic than Ciudad. The tapas were excellent although the beef was cooked very rare, like bloody. I know this is how they eat their beef in Barcelona, but I couldn't handle it...just too rare for me. Also the service at this restaurant was less friendly than at Ciudad Condial. THere was a wait and it was worth it, the place was electric with activity and had a great vibe. I'd definately recommend a visit. Also it was very reasonably priced."
5074,13-11-2011 ,5.0,The tapas are so tastful you just cannot stop ordering...and the sangria or wines are perfect as well..!!Seriously you have to go at least once!!If there is a line and you must wait for a table..do it!!You will be rewarded afterwards..I promise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Enjoy :D
5075,12-11-2011 ,5.0,"It's really hard to beat this place in terms of getting excellent tapas & nice drinks, and the locals know it too. There's a queue building outside after 18 already so come early; for us this was the perfect spot before going to a concert at the Palau Musica Catalana. Check the selection of cava, there's some very nice ones."
5076,10-11-2011 ,5.0,"We waited half an hour to be seated in Cerveceria Catalana. We ordered a pitch of Sangria and table full of tapas. The shrimp tapas are excellent ,one should definitelly try them."
5077,10-11-2011 ,5.0,"My husband and I went here with friends during our stay in Barcelona on October 30th. After a longer than expected walk from our hotel around 7:30 pm, (where my husband was complaining about the distance to go to a restaurant when we passed numerous other restaurants along the way) we arrived at a very crowded restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. We gave the hostess our name and were told that it would be a 30-35 minute wait. We opted to wait. Another friendly restaurant patron suggested ordering a pitcher of Sangria at the Bar window while waiting, which we did. The bartender prepared the Sangria while I watched. It was delicious! Before we knew it (in about 20 minutes) our indoor table was ready. The tables are close together, so it is not an intimate, romantic place for couples. There were many local families there as well as tourists like us. We asked the friendly waiter for tapa suggestions. We ordered a few of his recommendations as well as a few of our own picks, in addition to another pitcher of Sangria. Some of the waiter were not as helpful or friendly..The four of us had a great evening with wonderful food and drink. This restaraunt is easy to find locate; on the corner of Rambla de Catalunya and C/ Malloca, 236. It was definitely worth the wait and somewhere I would highly recommend."
5078,8-11-2011 ,2.0,"The food was ok but the experience was miserable due to excessive crowding, noise and rude, indifferent, and incompetent wait staff. There are much better tapas choices in Barcelona."
5079,7-11-2011 ,4.0,"we went tonight according to tripadvisor;s rating as I am tied of trying whatever tapas restaurant by radom. There is a reason why people strongly recommend this restaurant.We tried about 10 tapas and they are all delicious! Especially the `brocheta langustinal, paris mushroom, green pepper, salmon and all kins of pancetta with breands, they are all delicilous. Not expensive. We two paied 75 euro with 4 drinks. The place is very busy while the waiters are veery efficient. Will go back this week:)"
5080,7-11-2011 ,5.0,"Yes there will be a wait, but Oder a pitcher of sangria while you wait and not only will you not be disappointed but the time will go much faster. They make the sangria fresh and you can tell. The smell alone is captivating. The atmosphere was great very modern. Because the tapas were so good, we got very adventurous and enjoyed every one. You must try the grilled peppers. Our friend who normally would not eat them said they were one of her favorites. This place cannot be missed when you are in Barcelona."
5081,7-11-2011 ,5.0,"My sister suggested that we eat dinner here. At first I was reluctant because we were advised that it was an hour's wait for a table for four people, she said they always say that. So, we waited and got a table after thirty minutes. Service was quick (so is the turnover!) anyway, food is lovely and not that expensive. That is why people queue up at this restaurant. FYI. they don't take reservations."
5082,7-11-2011 ,3.0,"After reading the rave reviews on TA and elsewhere we were looking forward to our first experience of authentic tapas. Perhaps we went on a bad day. The staff weren't really very helpful (in fact one waitress could barely bring herself to smile at all). The interior was nothing special. And the tapas was a bit bland, mushy and uninteresting (we had much better later in our stay in a randomly chosen bar). Not great IMHO."
5083,6-11-2011 ,5.0,"Don't let the name fool you as this is much more than a brewery/restaurant. Tapas were excellent, diverse and economical. The atmosphere was chic and modern and very enjoyable for a few drinks (good wine in addition to the beer). The food quality was excellent and service was accommodating, but at times hard to attract due to the busy scene and action. Will stop again on our next visit to Barcelona."
5084,3-11-2011 ,5.0,"A definite when staying in Bracelona, even for one night, not to be missed. You will have to queue to get a table at night but only 20 / 30 mins but the wait is worth it. Great food, loads of Tapas, I thought I had seen it all until we came here, great choice. The atmosphere is high energy with staff to match, however, the food is the jewel in the crwon of Catalana"
5085,3-11-2011 ,4.0,"This is the 1st time we were in Barcelona and our first try of tapas. This restaurant was very fully booked and we must to wait more than half an hour to be seated. However, it was worthy to wait as tapas and other dishes were delicious. For dessert, I had caramel which was so so. But I love the atmosphere of this restaurant therefore overall I ranked it 8/10 and would absolutely return at our next trip to Barcelona."
5086,3-11-2011 ,5.0,"We were recommended to try this place by the concierge at our hotel. At first we were apprehensive, assuming that he would send us to one of those 'tourist traps'. It turned out to be quite an opposite. We saw more locals there than tourists. The place is busting with people, so you might need to wait, but it definitely worth it. This place offers a wide selection of fresh, delicious tapas of many kinds and excellent sangria. So my advice would be - stay away from all the 'tourists traps' on Rambla and satisfy your craving for tapas here, even if you have to wait about half and hour."
5087,2-11-2011 ,5.0,"We had tapas all over town and this was the first and last place we went to. Not only was it cheaper than many, it was also better than most. It's a bit frenetic at times and the queue by the time we left was a bit horrifying. The locals eat very late, many restaurants dont open until 9pm - so if you arrive before 8pm then it should be OK.Delicious Croquettes, also Cuttlefish vg. The Camins Priorat is a. excellent and b. cheaper here than elsewhere at E24.60 pb. Oddly most restaurants carry this wine and it gives some gauge of pricing."
5088,2-11-2011 ,4.0,"This is a large tapas restaurant, among the biggest I encountered in my ten days in Barcelona. It has a long bar as well as two large rooms with tables of all sizes. It is a popular spot at almost any time of the day, but the maitre d'hotel takes your name and ensures that diners are served in the order they arrived. There are no reservations, like most restaurants in Barcelona.We liked this restaurant so much that we returned several times. Notable tapas included baked camembert with nuts and grilled veal. The creme brule was delicious.Service was always efficient and speedy. Many servers speak English, and were helpful in recommending dishes."
5089,31-10-2011 ,5.0,"We went to CC on a Friday early afternoon. We have tried tapas in Barcelona several times, but had heard it was good.We had to wait 10-15 minutes for a seat at the bar (we could have had a table before that, but wanted to sit close to the food).We planned to just have a snack and a drink since we had a dinner reservation later in the evening - but the temptations were many and the food was sooooo goood! The waiters behind the bar was very helpful and also shared info about his personal favorites. We tried and tried and were more and more amazed.Unfortunately, we had to leave to reach our dinner reservation (which lso was excellent), but we went back for lunch on the day after. Then the line was very long, and we unfortunately selected to go another place - and were terribly dissapointed.We will absolutely be back at CC next time in Brcelona!"
5090,31-10-2011 ,5.0,"Loved the Catalana. Food is excellent and reasonably priced. First time we went, it was pretty crowded, but we got seated really quickly. Service was excellent. We returned two days later and were seated with a couple of locals, one a Catalan, the other a Basque. They spoke no English, but we were able to communicate quite effectively. They were very helpful and friendly. They told us they come to this restaurant often because of the good food and good value."
5091,31-10-2011 ,5.0,"Our cousins had eaten here in June and recommended this restaurant for our August visit. We arrived at 9:20pm and their were people everywhere -- we were told it would be an hour and a half wait but we had nothing else to do so we waited, and amazingly the crowds kept getting bigger until about 11pm. The wait was worth it -- everything we ordered was great, the waiter was fun, and for Barcelona it was reasonably priced. We liked it so much we went back a second time (this time we got there at 8pm and sat within 5 minutes.) The last night of our visit we decided to go to a tapas restaurant nearer our hotel -- big mistake, it wasn't even in the same league."
5092,31-10-2011 ,4.0,"The best tapas restaurant in town (I have been there several times during my 3 trips to BCN). It's better to go there for lunch because it's packed for diner and you will have to wait for a table for 50 minutes or an hour. If you do not want to wait for a table try to eat at the bar : they serve the same food as in the restaurant but there is no reservation and as soon as someone lives you can sit down and enjoy delicious tapas, montaditos...Try the pescaditos fritos, they are excellent..."
5093,31-10-2011 ,3.0,"This was a little bit like a fast food tapas restaurant. It was very busy and the service was quick and efficient. The staff were friendly and spoke good English and were happy to help. There was a good selection including some daily specials on the back of the drinks menu, although these were in Spanish. The food itself was of a reasonable standard although not as good as some of the smaller tapas bars around. There was also a very good selection of bottled beers from around Europe if you wanted a change from Spanish lager."
5094,30-10-2011 ,5.0,"This was a 2 minute walk from our hotel and I spotted it on the way in from the airport. Packed with locals it could seem a little daunting to even seasoned tourists but don't let that put you off. The service was sharp (if a little abrupt - this was maybe because it was busy - and it wasn't rude - just very efficient). The food is the best tapas catalans can offer. Our waiter told us to stop as he felt we were ordering too much. Wonderful experience, even though the place was packed the order came out in a timely manner and we were not hurried for our table to give to waiting diners. Very very good, we will return asap!"
5095,30-10-2011 ,4.0,We have to wait over an hour in the rain to get a table. They should start taking bookings. The tapas is great though and the staff are helpful. Once inside the restaurant is pretty spacious and relaxed.If you go as a couple try to grab seats at the bar near the door or on one of the handful of tables outside. You can save yourself a long wait that way. 
5096,29-10-2011 ,5.0,"I could go and have lunch and dinner everyday there when in Barcelona. The food is perfect, the atmosphere is amazing and everything is cooked while you watch. I've been many times and every time was perfect.Just sit at the bar on the right - worth the wait - and choose from the vast and mouth-watering array of tapas, either cold or warm.Make sure to finish with the Roscon - absolutely delicious."
5097,29-10-2011 ,4.0,"What a variety of tapas and montaditos. I just couldn't decide there was such a hug range so I asked my Spanish business colleagues to choose. This was a good idea. The different beers were also good and I tried one I haven't drunk before. Fortunately we arrived early later on it was really full. Certainly not a ""cheap"" place but well worth it."
5098,25-10-2011 ,5.0,"Excellent tapas! Good service! You cannot book a table, so you have to wait to get one..in the end, its was worth it for me. "
5099,25-10-2011 ,4.0,"This place is probably one of the best places in the center of Barcelona, when looking for some genuine tapas. Been here twice, and on both occassions I ate very good. Spanish style service, but that has its own charm :-)"
5100,21-10-2011 ,4.0,"This restaurant must be one of the best tapas style restaurants for the price in Barcelona. The food was truly excellent, and the price was totally reasonable at the bar. It was a lot less than I expected. I was there at about 4pm (quiet time), and I am sure it really fills up at about 9pm when you probably have little room to stand, considering the value for money."
5101,20-10-2011 ,5.0,"Some of the best tapas I had in Barcelona. Cool place, had a nice table outside on the sidwalk. Big menu with lots of options, both simple and complex favorites. Presentation of all dishes was excellent, with the taste to match. Highly recommended for lunch or dinner."
5102,20-10-2011 ,4.0,"came here first time 6 years ago, very constant quality, always crowded even more at night than at lunch.probably due to other restaurants having improved quality i felt that this one is stagnating some courses were less refined."

5104,18-10-2011 ,5.0,"Way up las Ramblas, several streets away heading north from Boqueria, on the corner of Rambla Catalunya and Mallorca, is the tapas place where Catalanes and Spaniards go for a drink after work or for a good meal. The razor clams were EXCEPTIONAL as were the grilled sepia (larger cousin of the squid). Great wines (of course, you are in Spain!), great service, almost friendly... Get off the Rambla main drag and go where the professional Barcelonians go!"
5105,18-10-2011 ,4.0,We loved this restaurant. The food was DELICIOUS and the prices very reasonable! We ordered tapas at the bar and then moved to a table and ordered more tapas with a bottle of wine!! The service was friendly and quick. The waiter told us that we were lucky because we went early (around 7 pm) on a Tuesday. He said that most other times the restaurant is crowded and busy. I definitely recommend this restaurant.
5106,16-10-2011 ,4.0,"Spent 5 days in Barcelona recently and in terms of eating adventurously we had a good mix of great restaurants and traumatic experiences (read: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d2263808-Reviews-American_Soda-Barcelona_Catalonia.html). On our last day we decided to venture into Cerveceria Catalana after reading good reviews.We went for brunch on Sunday so there was none of the much mentioned waiting time to get a table. The bar seating was full but the main dining wasn't so service was quite attentive. Waiters spoke fluent Engllish and Spanish and recommended the Spanish omelette which turned out to be to-die-for. We tried some of the tapas including the cuttlefish, the fluetas, and some other recommendations. A lot of food and for only 40 Euros. We returned around 6PM for early dinner and was lucky enough to get a table quickly. The restaurant's main dining and bar was full so the service was spotty but the the food was still exceptional. They had a broad beer list - we recommend you ask the waiter for recommendations - they know what is the best.Overall, good food for your buck but since you are reading this based on recommendations for tourists, do expect that everyone else visiting Barcelona who browse Tripadvisor or other travel sites will be there for dinner. I suggest you go for brunch or lunch like we did or early dinner to be able to savor the ambience and get attentive service you can't expect after 8PM. I will definitely recommend to friends and will come back (when we come back to Barca!)."
5107,16-10-2011 ,4.0,"This was recommended to me by the hotel. Went here on a Sunday afternoon and had a 20 minute wait. I asked for a menu in English and got one and an Englidh speaking waitier. The only mistake I made was not realizing that all tapas could be for a half order. That would have given me more variety. I did not feel that there were only toursits there since I did not hear a lot of languages besides Spanish around me. I felt very comfortable dining on my own. Afterwards, it was a very short walk to Gaudi's casa Mila."
5108,15-10-2011 ,3.0,"The restaurant was full, had to wait 10 minutes. I went there because of the 500 votes on tripadvisor but was pretty dissapointed. The food was nothing special, small prices, full of oil, I felt sick after. If you look for something really tasty go somewhere else. There are other restaurants maybe a little bit more expensive but where you can eat better."
5109,13-10-2011 ,3.0,"We had to go her after getting recommendations from anyone who's been to Barcelona rcently. However, it seems that the place got too popular among tourists for its own good. There areno locals there, and for a good reason. The service is unfriendly (careless even - I guess it's that with so many people coming why bother) and the place feels packed in a bad way and is exetremely noisy.In short, while not utterly bad, it has all the signs of a tourist trap in the making. Avoid."
5110,13-10-2011 ,5.0,I travel for business a lot and go to Barcelona 4-5 times a year! I would not eat anywhere else! I even try to have lunch and dinner there! Be prepared to wait if you go after 8pm but it is worth it!
5111,11-10-2011 ,5.0,"like alot of people said....IT IS WORTH THE WAIT...YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED!! We went there our first night in barcelona as it was suggested by out hotel and went back there the last night of our stay. Honestly speaking, it was the best food we had in town...we went to pricier places and were very disapointed.The prices are very cheap (considering the value/quantity and quality of food). My husband and I shared a total of 8 tapas + a bottle of wine and all cost us about 50euros...now thats a deal!I have been back from barcelona for a month and keep thinking about the amazing food that i had at this restaurant...you should try it!\"
5112,10-10-2011 ,5.0,"Recommended by friends, we ate here 9/16/11, the first of three nights in Barcelona, and returned the last . Remarkably better than the two other highly rated tapas restaurants we visited. The variety of menu choices, the extremely hyper-active but comfortable environment, the helpful wait staff, all made for an outstanding experience. An eclectic international clientele were friendly and there was no language impasse."
5113,9-10-2011 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by Jaime at our hotel. He assured us we would not be disappointed. He was absolutely right.Located on a side street just off a main thoroughfare, you'll know you're at the right place by the line/crowd. Don't let that dissuade you. Inside the crowded bar, the hostess takes your name and gives you the time to wait. Go early.The place is perhaps lacking in ambiance, however, the food is unbelievable and the service extremely quick. We tried a little of everything. The tapas were fantastic. Dessert was great too. If you are not used to spanish food (we aren't) just dive in and try a number of things, even if you don't think you'd like them. You might very well be surprised.The beer on tap was lovely (and I'm not a beer drinker).Great surprise is the cost. Dinner for 4 (including 4 drinks) 70 Euros before tip.This is a fantastic spot and if we had had longer in Barcelona we would definitely have gone back."
5114,7-10-2011 ,5.0,"Do not be put off by the queue. Put your name down and you will be told how long the wait will be, sometimes up to an hour. Don't worry, every time we had to wait only about half that. Stay beside the bar and try the house wine - excellent and great value. Have been here with family and now with work colleagues from Germany, France and USA. everyone was enthusiastic and wants to go back."
5115,5-10-2011 ,5.0,This place was recommended by our hotel concierge and it did not disappoint. You will have to wait but it is definitely worth it. It was so good that we ate here 2 nights out of our 4 night stay in Barcelona. The sautéed mushrooms with ham were to die for. So was the coleslaw and ham topped crostini.
5116,4-10-2011 ,4.0,"This place was recommended by a friend living in Barcelona. I was on a family vacation touring Spain and had not had much success with locating the good tapas restaurants in other cities, so we were happy to finally find a nice restaurant with the excellent Spanish tapas we've promised ourselves. We particularly liked the savory ""crazy eggs"" dish, and the fried green pepper.The service was a bit rushed, but I'm told this is how tapas places operate.It was also handy that the personnel spoke English, and that the restaurant is a walking distance from Plaça de Catalunya."
5117,3-10-2011 ,5.0,"This hot spot is loved by locals and tourists alike. They don’t take reservations so be ready for a wait, which is well worth it and the perfect opportunity to take a stroll down Rambla de Catalunya. Try the alcachofas laminadas (thinly-sliced fried artichokes), cuatro quesos (bread topped with four heavenly melted cheeses), brocheta de langostinos (perfectly grilled prawns), pimientos del padrón (fried green peppers) and the solomillo (mini beef fillet).

5118,1-10-2011 ,5.0,"My husband and I are from NYC and rarely hit up the same restaurant twice...and yet in Barcelona last month came here TWICE. This place is wonderful....a wide selection of wonderful Spanish tapas, lovely staff and a great location. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a delicious lunch or dinner....and definitely try some of the many seafood selections- top notch!"
5119,28-09-2011 ,5.0,Great food. Vibrant atmosphere. A highlight of any trip to Barcelona. 
5120,25-09-2011 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a classic amongst the locals. Tapas are first-rate but the ""flautas"" ( flautas are very thin versions of a crispy french stick) are outstanding. They have flauta specials everyday for breakfast ( incl. Sunday) which are really good value. Staff are courteous although a touch slow at times. Well worth a visit."
5121,24-09-2011 ,5.0,"This place is fabulous . It was unbelievably busy ( Sat. Night ) but all the staff were friendly and positive . I couldn't believe how hard and fast they worked . I saw one of the waiters actually run more than a couple of times . The atmosphere was as positive as I've seen in any restaurant , both staff and customers . The food was distinctive and wonderful . Every dish we had was new to us and we loved them all . Every ingredient was fresh , fresh . When the bill came we were in shock at how reasonable it was . We've been traveling in Europe for 6 weeks now and this was one of the top places we've been . We both just loved everything about it ."
5122,21-09-2011 ,4.0,Great atmosphere and place to be if you are keen on trying the notorious TAPAS !!!A bit difficult to get a table as always very very busy therefore better if you are in a small group or with a local !!
5123,19-09-2011 ,5.0,You come to this place for the food and not the relaxed ambiance of Southern Mediterranean culture. The place is filled (read packed) with locals and tourists and the serve a wide variety of very good tapas. Get the early or plan on waiting an hour for a table. You can always try and squeeze into a spot at one of the two bars. The seafood is as fresh as it gets.
5124,17-09-2011 ,4.0,"A bottle of sparking wine, and 6 dishes for 55euro... not bad for a Tapa restaurant in the heart of the city. The staff all spoke English, and are pretty easy going. The food is decent, (I am by no means a Tapa expert, but it's better than what I've tasted in the US). I can totally see why it's rated well on TripAdvisor."
5125,16-09-2011 ,5.0,"It was our second time in this restaurant. We found out that it is better to go there for a late breakfast/early lunch; otherwise you must wait for a long time to get a table. Anyway, we went there for the late breakfast and it was amazing as expected. We had fresh pressed juices, coffee, water and a variety of small tapas. The food was amazing, the service is quite professional, but they are very busy - so do not expect a cozy chat with a waiter. They run all the time and serve! We paid about 35 Euro for 4 people – we found it quite reasonable taking into consideration how much good food we got. We would advice everyone to go to that place."
5126,15-09-2011 ,5.0,"It's a busy place, and the service is more efficient than friendly, but oh, the food. Every dish seemed lovingly prepared. The flauta de loma con queso was a highlight. If there's a line, wait in it. This place rules!"
5127,14-09-2011 ,4.0,"The tapas were excellent, the second best we had during a week in Barcelona. One dish was absolutely amazing. It was a plate of very thinly shredded fried potatoes and when there were brought to the table, the server cracked open an egg on top. This was delicious! You will see other people eating this dish, and you can just point it out to the server (that's what we did).The downside to this place is that it was packed! We had to wait for an hour, and there was no space to wait at the bar. So we had to go somewhere else to have a drink while we waited. Once we were seated, I got the feeling that we were bothering the server every time we asked for something. And we really weren't pestering him. But the server never stopped to see how we were doing, so whenever we wanted to order more drinks, we had to stop him when he walked by. All in all, I think this place is definitely worth a visit."
5128,12-09-2011 ,4.0,"We needed to wait over an hour for a table on a busy Saturday night, however, it was well worth it. Great atmosphere and tables were a mix tourists among many locals. Tasty tapas and sangria for a reasonable price."
5129,12-09-2011 ,5.0,"This is a traditional tapas restaurant in Barcelona that gets absolutely packed - both for lunchtime and dinner - and for good reason. The food is fantastic quality and has great prices to go with it. We went for a late lunch on our 3rd day in Barcelona and liked it so much that we came back for dinner the following day.Word of warning - expect a wait. If you need seats for more than 2, you may wait an hour plus. No big deal, just get a beer or a glass of wine from the bar, and mentally make a note of all the things you want to order while watching people eat. The best way to reduce wait time if you're just a couple is to just sit at the bar. It's first come first serve, so if you're lucky and can stand behind another couple just finishing, you can swoop their spot and get service much quicker than waiting for a table.A lot of the servers behind the bar are Filipino, so they can speak English extremely well, so if your Spanish/Catalan isn't great, don't hesitate to ask in English. The cold prawns, patatas bravas, clams, fideua (only at lunch), were all fantastic. I don't think there was anything that we didn't like here.Don't be intimidated by the wait - it's worth it! Cost of lunch for 2 was approx 45 Euros, and dinner was a bit pricer at around 60, but a great value for both quantity and quality of the food."
5130,12-09-2011 ,4.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is a Barcelona institution -a wide selection of freshly prepared tapas using market produce at competitive prices. Cerveceria Catalana has been around for a while and it is still mostly true to its original values, despite soaring popularity.Expect to wait in line for 30-60m on most occasions (no bookings allowed) and enjoy the specialities-deep fried camembert, calamares, mini hamburgers, prawn skewers, pimientos del padron and more. My advice is skip the jamon or ham...you can find better elsewhere (for example, in Las Arenas)."
5131,10-09-2011 ,5.0,"Amazing atmosphere. Amazing food. Extremely affordable. Come early or eat by the bar, otherwise prepare to wait for a table."
5132,8-09-2011 ,5.0,"Four star food at two star prices. They have an English menu. Everything that we ordered was delicious. I highly recommend ordering tapas specials of the day, which are written in Spanish. Even if you do not understand the menu just order from it! The presentation was wonderful. We ordered the special prawns with head on and the foie gras on top of warm apple and puff pastry. This was the best foodie dish of our trip. The foie gras tapas was salty and sweet at the same time. The foie gras was buttery when biting into it with the apply. For the prawns, they were succulent and well-seasoned. For the regular tapas we ordered calamari rings, potatoes with mayonnaise and fried sardines. All dishes were simple but loaded with taste! My only regret is not coming back to this restaurant more than once during our 4 day stay. Yes, the restaurant is touristy, but don't let that deter you! Also beers were under 3 euros and their house wine was under 2 euros. That was unheard of during our whole trip. Not only are the prices reasonable but the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and modern. I wish I could go back now!"
5133,8-09-2011 ,4.0,"Lovely food, great selection of dishes and good service - definitely worth a visit."
5134,8-09-2011 ,5.0,"Really enjoyed a lot of tapas and drinks. Had to wait 30 minutes as usual but well worth it ! Only spent €60 for four, four beers and sangriaI come here everytime"
5135,7-09-2011 ,5.0,"Great restaurant, must do in Barcelona. We Ordered various tapas! All were amazing & we were served very quickly. Staff were excellent!"
5136,6-09-2011 ,5.0,"This is a bustling, busy place. If your looking for quiet, laid back. This is not it. But if you want great tapas, great menu choices. Electric atmosphere, upscale setting. "
5137,6-09-2011 ,5.0,Tapas here were fresh and well seasoned! One of the best tapas I had throughout Spain - can't beat it. Waited around 40 minutes on a Saturday night for a table but it was well worth it. Food was amazing and the waiter was great. :)
5138,6-09-2011 ,3.0,we went early so we found a seat at the bar. Tapas were tasty but the prices are were expensive.
5139,5-09-2011 ,5.0,"This place is mega busy, so unless you want to wait over an hour or fight for a seat at the bar, try going there during the week and/or before 9pm. Once you do have a seat though, the service is great and the food is to die for! I ate here two nights in a row because I didn't think there could possibly be anywhere that served better food at such a great price. EAT HERE!!"
5140,2-09-2011 ,3.0,"My wife and I were advised by the hotel staff if we want to try local tapas. After all we were very disappointed. The place was very crowded and we had to wait half an hour to get a table. As we know some Spanish tapas dishes by name we ordered within 5 minutes after getting the menu. We ordered a bottle of wine and it was served very quickly. The tapas were served within 10 minutes after we had the wine, so the service is fast and that had to be with such a waiting queues. The food is average, not what we expected of a real Catalan Restaurant. The tapas were very basic and with not much taste. As my wife loves to make tapas in her own kitchen like real Catalan style we were at least expect their tapas better then my wife could make, to bad my wife makes better tapas then this restaurant. Our opinion is that this restaurant is overcrowded by tourists that get much lower quality of food then the locals do. At least we didn't pay that much, but it wasn't worth the price and waiting time to get a table. We can't recommend this restaurant to others."
5141,1-09-2011 ,5.0,"Great restaurant, must do in Barcelona. We ate early at 715pm compared to the usual Spanish dinner time. Did not have to wait, managed to get a table straight away. Sangria was strong but tasty! Ordered various tapas including Spanish omlete, cured ham, iberian potatoes, salad & tasty mini hot dogs! All were amazing & we were served very quickly. Staff were excellent & provided translation. Also had chocolate coolant & creme caramel to share...managed to find room!4 tapas, salad, water, 1/2 L Sangaria & 2 deserts 38euro! People sitting next to us had been There over 5 times in one week. Says it all really! It was packed when we left, wait was 1 1/2hrs about 30 people waiti g. Make sure you go early so you don't miss out!"
5142,31-08-2011 ,5.0,"Great tapas, fast service, and fun atmosphere. It was open late and very crowded but was worth the wait. One of the better places that the city has to offer."
5143,30-08-2011 ,4.0,"What a fabulous restaurant......as long as you don't mind waiting up to an hour for a table. You can, however, get a drink at the bar and stand outside until you are called. Wine by the glass was under €2 and the food was equally cheap but excellent quality. On the second visit we asked for certain tapas to come together as otherwise they just come as they are ready and don't always match how you might like to eat them. On the first visit on Thursday evening we were pushed along as it was really busy but the Sunday night visit was much more relaxed. Not a sit back and graze leisurely sort of place! "
5144,30-08-2011 ,4.0,"We went to Cerveceria Catalana after reading all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. The place was extremely crowded and we had to wait for a table for an hour (you can also eat tapas at the bar if you are lucky enough to get a seat). The bartenders were really rude, which I can understand given the amounts of people they have to serve, but still not a great experience. Once you get a table, the service is quite good though. We had 6 or7 different tapas, and most of them were nice. Razor clams were full of sand and impossible to eat. Potato with egg was probably the best. All in all, Cerveceria Catalana offers good food at a good price, but no way I will wait for an hour again. Not worth it and there are less crowded places with just as good tapas."
5145,26-08-2011 ,4.0,Super packed restaurant with locals and tourists alike. Its great tapas and an awesome environment. Love this place.
5146,24-08-2011 ,5.0,"This place was rammed with people when we arrived at around 23:00 on a Tuesday night. Great atmosphere with lots going on; people eating at the bar with drinks (what we did - as the wait for a table was 45 min - 1 hr!). It seems to be 'the Place' for tapas, all sorts of people both tourist and local here. Found the choice of tapas to be extensive and varied, you can ask for seafood fresh from the counter and have it cooked in minutes. Very fast service!! Food was very tasty - good quality chorizo and veal sirloin was delicious! Would go again."
5147,23-08-2011 ,4.0,"Excelent tapas, not cheap but very good quality and huge choice. The only problem is that many people come and it can be difficult to have a table."
5148,23-08-2011 ,4.0,"Had dinner here last night. Lovely tapas, drinks very reasonable. All in all a great experience, would recommend. "
5149,23-08-2011 ,3.0,"We were recommended this tapas restaurant by numerous people especially locals during our stay. We went on our first day at about 4.30pm. We were only going to have a couple of small nibbles as we had a booking at Botafumerio later that night....that didn't happen as we were easily tempted to have quite a lot of nibbles as the food was so great. Because it was an odd time, we were able to sit at the bar and interact with the bar staff. The bar man was very helpful recommending signature dishes and suggesting some great options. We had such a fantastic experience we came back on the last day for lunch. The food again was great however we were sat in the main restaurant where we had an AWFUL waiter and service was extremely poor. the dishes of day are all in Spanish and he was unwilling to spend the trouble to translate. He did however suggest to have the most expensive dish in the menu (!) - almejas galena plancha (clams) which fortunately turned out to be absolutely amazing and one of my favourite dishes of the trip. Also recommend the chipirones andaluza which I had thought I was ordering small sausages...turned out it was baby octopus (!)...was fantastic though.If you don't know what you want then sit at the bar so you can see the dishes being made."
5150,21-08-2011 ,5.0,Having read some great reviews of this place we turned up late on a Friday night and got a table straight away despite it being quite busy. The service was very friendly and polite and we sat down to some of the best food we've had in Barcelona! I had the goat's cheese 'bricks' with mint and bacon and my girlfriend had the foie gras. Both were incredible and gave rise to some powerful food envy!
5151,19-08-2011 ,5.0,We originally didn't go to this place because of the wait but on the last night of our honeymoon we decided to give it a try since there was always a crowd there! Boy was it worth it! They made me gluten and dairy free tapas and the food came out pretty fast! The staff was so friendly too! Perfect end to my honeymoon with this delicious food!
5152,16-08-2011 ,2.0,I liked the foods but really hated the receptionists. Non professional
5153,15-08-2011 ,3.0,"We went to this restaurant based on the rave reviews on Trip Advisor and even thought it is very rare that I disagree with the ratings, I have to on this one. We went early (about 8:30pm) waited 50 minutes (after being told 20 minutes) and that would have been ok but the food just wasnt as good as other places we went to in Barcelona that didn't have any wait. To put in your name for outdoor seating was with a different person and was even longer wait (1 1/2 hours).The service was incredibly slow because they were jam packed and we got put at a table for 4 that was originally a larger table that had been pulled apart (like the kind where you would insert table leaves). It was still attached so we could only sit on 3 sides and were about 1 foot from the other diners. The food was just mediocre compared to other places we tried and was a little more expensive as well. The waiter was so hectic that he kept giving our orders to the people at the other end of the table (who arrived after us) --- they kept the parts of our order that were the same as theirs and had ours sent down to us so we then had to wait even longer to get our original orders.Again -- it would have been ok (although irritating) if the food had been great but it just wasn't -- try some of the other places in the Trip Advisor rating."
5154,11-08-2011 ,4.0,We went to this restaurant because of all the great review on TripAdvisor. And I must say I was not dissapointed. We had a great dinner for two and we payed around €35 including a 10%+ tip. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
5155,8-08-2011 ,5.0,"I had already been there 2 years ago, even improved now:quality of food and service absolutely great! Value for money and great quality indeed. Absolutely reccomended!"
5156,8-08-2011 ,5.0,"This place is worth the long wait (as the locals can tell you).The place carries wonderful tapas, amazing quality, and reasonable prices."
5157,7-08-2011 ,5.0,"Fantastic fresh delicious tapas, very reasonably priced. Good service too, although usually very busy. We went three or four times in the course of a three-night stay nearby! Much much better than its 'sister restaurant' Ciudad Condal..."
5158,5-08-2011 ,5.0,"We celebrated my husband's birthday, it was a pleasure !!!!! Great food and atmosphere !!! We are going again before leaving Barcelone."
5159,3-08-2011 ,5.0,We got to the restaurant at 12.30pm after arriving late in Barcelona. We were served quickly and our food came in no time. The tapas were amazing! After splitting the bill it was 10 euros each between 7 of us for around 16 tapas and 2 bottles of wine. Really good value and an amazing atmosphere.
5160,2-08-2011 ,5.0,"The food was great - we loved the veal! Very good quality tapas unlike many restaurants in barcelona. Only 45 euros for 9 tapas, 2 glasses of wine, one beer, an almond cake and 2 coffees!Amazing value with a buzzing atmosphere.GO!!!"
5161,1-08-2011 ,5.0,"Went twice in a 3 day city break - Waiting time first night was 40 mins (not a problem when the house wine in less than 2 euros a glass). Second night waiting time was only 10 mins. Warm, friendly helpful staff and a great ""buzz"" about the place. The veal was outstanding. Go there and enjoy!"
5162,29-07-2011 ,5.0,"A very good quality/price ratio for this place. Tapas are excellent, we loved their patatas bravas (we asked for the sauce to be served on the side, so we could put as much as we liked), the grilled squid, the shrimp brochettes, the camembert roll, basically everything we tried. The sangria is very good too. One night we went at 8h30 and were seated right away, but when we got there after 9 we had to wait for more than 1hr. The wine by glass was cheap and good. As our hotel (Murmuri) was very close, we ended up eating here 4 nights out of 5. For the three of us, with sangria and everything my son wanted to try, it never went higher than 55 euro."
5163,28-07-2011 ,5.0,"My family and our friends went there because our friend knew this is one of the ""hot"" places in Barcelona, hard to get in at peak time (8 to 9 PM) so we all went for lunch after visiting Park Guell. The place was quiet then, so we can't talk about the bar and people watching factor, but the food was excellent! Salpicon de mariscos (seafood salad) almost as good as the ones in La Coruña and excellent Pimientos de piquillo (small sweet red peppers stuffed with local cheese). Ask for ""tinto de verano"" to drink (red wine and a lemony local drink), most refreshing on a hot day!"
5164,27-07-2011 ,5.0,"I have been several times to this restaurant which is both delicious and cheap The issue is usually the long lines but on two occasions I got a table for 6 within ten minutes despite the long lines just because most patrons are ususally 2 . So don't be put off if you're a big party. Also when you are seated , ask for your table number and make trips to the bar to order whatever you fancy . My personal favorites, flautas con Jbuco iberico with the most crispy baguette I've ever tasted, tortilla which is made to order , soft and hot , all seafood either fried or a la plancha. The housewine white is terrific for less than 8 euros a bottle"
5165,26-07-2011 ,4.0,"We heard it was sooo busy but if you go when the locals consider lunch time, there's really no problem. Maybe in the weekdays but not when we tried. The locals eat dinner around 10pm but that's not the way we do it in Norway, so we were happy to eat our dinner at 4pm in their lunch setting! Lots of free tables and open all day. Thy have a larger restaurant and from what I believe, also a new logo. We especially liked the fried Camembert and the Paris entrecôte. We did however miss a lot of our tapas favourites, like bacon dates and such. Overall good value for money and good food!"
5166,25-07-2011 ,4.0,"Totally recommend this place. Wonderful food, although there was a hefty hour long wait. But it was worth it. Atmosphere is good, food is even better. Although the queueing was a nightmare. Might be best to get there early but worth going to at any time. A must."
5167,22-07-2011 ,5.0,"All my friends agree to this: Barcelona that's a fantastic city with great shopping, lovely culture, great beach and fantastic Cerveceria Catalana!We can't have been to Barcelona without visiting this fantastic restaurant at least twice!With waiting times with often over an hour it speaks for it! It is undoubtedly worth the wait...The food is delicious and cheap!"
5168,20-07-2011 ,4.0,"Arrived and having read reviews knew we would have to wait. make sure you put your name down for both outside and inside table to get first available. We met a couple who had arrived 1/2 an hour before us but only put name down for outside and were still waiting when we sat down (after 40 min wait). Great tapas and atmosphere. Service impressive, no feeling of being rushed. Best night out in Barca for us."
5169,19-07-2011 ,3.0,"We went on a recommendation from friends and found the place packed at around 1pm for lunch which was a surprise. We sat down and grabbed a beer from their respectable list and chose a couple tapas including: manchego cheese, and a Russian salad which was potatoes, peas, and tuna. The salad was a sub for the artichokes I wanted but were not in season. We ordered two mini hamburgers but they were never served. After sitting for awhile we began to regret not ordering the egg dish on the menu as it looked and smelled amazing going by our table. Overall the price was a bit high for the quality of the food, but everything that arrived was tasty."
5170,19-07-2011 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana is slightly outside of the main tourist spots and yet quite touristy. nevertheless this mix between modern and stylish restaurant and local, traditional food was one of our favourites! the value for money is excellent!Waiting time ist to be expected though as the place is just heavily crowded. reservations recommended for bigger groups."
5171,17-07-2011 ,5.0,We had only four days in barcelona. Upon arrival we asked for a spot which locals and tourists went that served tapas and local dishes. We arrived at Cerveceria Catalana not knowing what to expect and have an open mind. Sat at the bar (got a seat right away!) and ended up eating for a good 45 minutes. The tapas caters for all people and is a truly unique experience. The staff are on a mission to churn people through the restaurant but if you can avoid noticing that and relax its a great venue. The food is different to anything I had ever experienced and is a blend of all culture's major dishes. Very worth the trip as there are nice shops in the area as well.
5172,17-07-2011 ,4.0,"It's a nice place... somewhat touristy, I personally enjoyed the food portions were ok back then.. had the solomillitos (little sirloins) the sliders, stuffed piquillos (bell peppers), foie gras with figs, clams, cod, sardines, and a lot of pintxos and tapas whose names I can't recall... quite tasty...In short, it's not cheap, it's crowded, you have to sit at the bar stools to get quick and effective service, and finally if you're not familiar with the dishes and not adventurous try another place... To be honest with you I like it a lot... when I'm in Barcelona I go there every time"
5173,14-07-2011 ,5.0,MUST GO! And go early. We got there at 8:30 and had to wait about 40 minutes.It just got more crowded. But so worth it. Nuff said!!
5174,9-07-2011 ,5.0,"The best in barcelona, long wait for a table but that says it all. Best food, best price, best atmosphere. Try the razor clams"
5175,3-07-2011 ,5.0,"If you want to have amazing, fresh, tasty tapas whilst in Barcelona, you MUST eat here!! We ate here three times in 4 days!! Two dinners and one lunch. Both dinners we wait between 1/2 an hour to an hour for a table but it is so worth it!! The food is DELICIOUS!!! If you like cheese, make sure you order the three cheeses on the mini baguette! Absolutely amazing!! However, I didn't eat anything here that I didn't love!! Go at about 10pm for the best atmosphere as that's when all the locals seem to go for dinner! :)"
5176,30-06-2011 ,5.0,Had to wait 40 mins for a table but you can buy a drink at the bar and wait outside or inside!!good portion for the price!wine was also good and cheap!advice just go a little earlier than than 9 30 pm!also very central location 
5177,26-06-2011 ,5.0,"We went based on other reviews from Tripadvisor - the food was fantastic, we had to wait about half an hour for a table but they came to find us at the bar when our table was ready. We enjoyed some great Sangria while we waited which was reasonably priced at 12 euros 50 for a large jug - by far the best Sangria we had. Great atmosphere too and I would certainly go again."
5178,26-06-2011 ,5.0,Great place to hang out. Come at 20:30 and sit on the bar
5179,23-06-2011 ,5.0,"It was the best tapas we ate in Barcelona and we ate in many places. You can try everything without doubt, really delicious. Fried calamari was my favorite, it was fresh, not frozen like in many tapas bars. The deserts were also tasty. Would strongly recommend the place. The queue is a problem, yes, but it's worth it."
5180,21-06-2011 ,4.0,a lot of neighbours .. always a very good sign!not cheap but excellent tapasaffordable wines
5181,20-06-2011 ,4.0,"Extremely busy tapas bar with crowds outside waiting for a table. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait but luckily a lot of people had given up waiting so we were seated within 20 minutes. Good choice of Tapas, buzzy atmosphere and pleasant staff."
5182,20-06-2011 ,4.0,"First thing you notice is the queue. It's not that bad if you're a couple and their system is quite reliable (see below). The menu is very diverse - veggies, meat and seafood - plus there is a daily menu at the back of the beer menu but it's in Spanish. We had 2 good meals. Particularly good dishes were dates wrapped in bacon, mini steak, grilled prawns and mini hamburger. The fried champignon mushrooms on the regular menu were simple yet genius. Surprisingly, typical local dishes were below average – fried calamari, patatas bravas, assortment of salads, and desserts were so-so. Dishes range from 1.5 to 12 euros, our bill was around Euro 60 including drinks. Service is ok compared with most places we visited in town. Sitting system: for a table - register with both the indoor hostess and the outdoor waiter; for bar stools – you'll need to lurk for vacating seats and grab them as fast as you can. We waited 15 minutes in the evening (were told it would take 45 min) and didn't wait at all for lunch. Groups of 4 or more seem to take forever so arrive early or book in advance if possible."
5183,18-06-2011 ,4.0,We were recommended this place by a taxi driver.... who dropped us off out the front. Expect to line up but it does appear this is where all the locals go. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day ......The variety and quality of the food was outstanding.... highly recommend it.The service was efficient and friendly and the staff were happy to explain the dishes to us.
5184,17-06-2011 ,3.0,"Ate here for dinner with my husband. Waited 15-20 minutes for a table which the queue was well organized. However tapas are a bit overpriced and service was pretty poor. Tapas were good but not excellent so not really worth the hype. Our greek salad was the worst greek salad I have ever eaten. It should be renamed and called a feta and pickle salad. Overall, there are better places for tapas in Barcelona for the price."
5185,15-06-2011 ,3.0,"Folks, if you haven't tried their Razor clams with cold San Miguel you haven't been to Barcelona. Except for that - expensive (or may i say ""tourist oriented""), packed so there's no oxygen left, the queue can take up to an hour till you get in. If you decided to go for it - bar seats only! The only way to chose the food you actully want (unless you're a master of Spanish cuisine and speak perfect Spanish)."
5186,9-06-2011 ,1.0,"Food was excellent!.. Nevertheless, after checking my bank account when we came back from our vacation, I found out that my credit card was double charged, i.e. I paid 2 times the same dinner. The person behind the bar said the card-reader didn't worked the first time and that we have to do it again...there you go!.. 40 euro tip for Cerveceria Catalana(!).. Such a shame, for such a nice restaurant..."
5187,8-06-2011 ,5.0,Upmarket tapas in eixample area. Great selection of standard tapas as well as tapas del dia. Approx €50 for 2 including a couple of glasses of wine. Good vegetarian selection which is hard to find and fantastic atmosphere.
5188,8-06-2011 ,5.0,"This place was recommended by a waitess in a hotel bar. She said 'you must have heard of Catalana, it's where all the locals go' so we thought we would give it a try, and were not dissapointed. Expect to spend around 20 Euros a head including wine and dessert. The food quality is outstanding. You will probably have to queue to get in, but can enjoy a drink whilst you wait. I would highly recommend the pumpkin cake served with desert wine at 2Euro40, you really can't go wrong. Watch out forthe cost of the clams though. Ordered them by accident and they were more expensive that about 4 other dishes combined!"
5189,8-06-2011 ,5.0,"We got this restaurant recomended by our hotel and was a bit skeptical, but it turned out to be outstanding for it's price range. My girlfriend didn't even think she likes tapas, but it turned out she was wrong, she loved it. For me it I got to say this is the best tapas I've had in Spain."
5190,7-06-2011 ,4.0,"The food was excellent, worth waiting for a table. Considering the ambience and the quality of the food and wine we very pleasantly surprised by the bill."
5191,7-06-2011 ,3.0,"The kind of place that is good to take your friends from out of town. When you´ve been a few times nothing great, very straight forward local tapas, but what´s fun is the bustle. The food is not great, some tapas better than others...."
5192,7-06-2011 ,4.0,Although very crowded we could seat and enjoy nice wine and lovely tapas ( cold and warm). Grilled fish ( calamari a la plancha) were outstanding. Service was friendly and efficient. They do not take reservations and seating might be difficult. Worh a vist though!
5193,5-06-2011 ,5.0,"This place really deserves the fantastic reviews it has received. We went for lunch and had a mix of tapas - flautas (little sandwiches) with ham and chorizo, patatas bravas and greek salad. The greek salad wasn't what we were expecting (no lettuce) but everything else was fantastic. Much better than the same dishes at other tapas places we tried. The atmosphere was very comfortable and the waiters were easy to communicate with and provided an English menu. The customers were a blend of locals and various tourists. The cost was also very reasonable for how good it was. With coffee and drinks I don't think that we paid more than 30 euros for a filling lunch."
5194,30-05-2011 ,4.0,Good atmosphere and very good service. The food is good but not great. It's good and fair choice in example area but you can find better food all around barcelona. The prices are ok and you can try it for a lunch after a morning in Shopping. Sangria is also good.
5195,30-05-2011 ,4.0,"Great food, great ambience. Waitress was rude but the meal made up for it. Amazing Prawn Skewers and helpful menu with English translation. We waited 20 minutes for a table but it was well worth it. Would return for sure!"
5196,29-05-2011 ,5.0,We basically stumbled across Cerveceria Catalana and as we were walking up thought it was going to be a more expensive stop than not. The place was packed and people were overflowing onto the sidewalk. We somehow managed to get a spot at the bar - the wait for a table was 30 minutes. The tapas was probably the best we had during our trip - they change it over every hour or so to keep it fresh and it was very yummy! The bar guy was engaging and helpful. The house wine was 1.80euro a glass! And because it was packed - with locals and tourists - the atmosphere was really fun and happening. We loved this place.
5197,28-05-2011 ,5.0,"Great tapas, nice drinks, good environment, quick service. If you go between 21.00 and 23.00 you will have trouble finding a table but they will serve you satisfingly quickly."
5198,27-05-2011 ,5.0,"This was one of our favorite restaurants in Spain. Recommended to us by a couple on a wine tour (incidentally check out Pares Balta if you want an intimate wine tour in Barcelona) and we were so happy we took them up on it!The crowds outside look daunting but by the time we'd ordered a glass of wine at the bar they'd already had us seated. The place is A LOT bigger than it looks from the outside. The food was fantastic - make sure you order the broken eggs with potatoes and brava sauce. It may be the best thing I ate in all of Spain. Beware, the portions are much larger than normal tapas - we definitely ordered more food than we needed, but everything was so delicious that we ate it all anyway!"
5199,26-05-2011 ,5.0,"This place serves great tapas at reasonable prices. You can sit at the bar or at a table. If you have to wait a few minutes to be seated, it is well worth it. Locals frequent this establishment and for a good reason: the tapas are mouth-watering. Try the huevos cabreados, the pescaditos and the ajies de Padron."
5200,25-05-2011 ,5.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was recommended by our hotel's concierge, and we ate dinner here twice. The tapas are absolutely delicious, and the prices are amazing: five tapas, mineral water and three glasses of wine for less than 30 Euros. Because the food is so good and the prices so reasonable, it's always crowded at dinner time. We arrived before 8:30 pm (early for dinner in Barcelona) and waited between 30 and 45 minutes for a table, but if the weather is good, that's not a burden. The hostesses -- friendly, polite, and fluent in English -- will give you a pretty good estimate of when your table will be ready, and you can wait on the sidewalk with a drink or stroll the beautiful streets in the neighborhood while you wait."
5201,20-05-2011 ,4.0,Is a busy place so the noise is quite high and the service is not the best.The tapas are good but you will be not served with a premium quality food.
5202,19-05-2011 ,5.0,After being very disappointed with everywhere we had tried we decided to give this a try.We arrived a about 8pm and waited for 10 mins to be seated.We had the mixed salads all of which were fantastic and Spanish omlette prawn skewers and the veal. I can honestly say the veal and prawns were the best thing we had tasted in a long long time.When we left at 9-30 the q of people waiting was so big we had to fight our way out.Best meal we have had.
5203,16-05-2011 ,3.0,"There was definately a buzz about this place, I loved it for that. The decor is easy on the eye and the house wine was excellent, but the food is average, and the service functional."
5204,13-05-2011 ,5.0,3 nights in Barcelona and used this Tapas bar twice. You cannot book a table but just wait until the next seats become available. The fact that the locals seem to use this bar more than tourists made it better for our enjoyment and helped the atmosphere generated. We sat at the bar both times we ate and we just chose our food from a vast choice of seafood meats salads and other delicacies. Allow 2 hours to enjoy this very good Tapas bar and possibly half an hour drinking an aperitif whilst you wait for your seat.
5205,9-05-2011 ,5.0,"My wife and I decided to give lunch a try after reading the reviews. Arrived before 1pm (early for the Spanish) so we were lucky to get seated right away.Oh yes! Lived up to all the hype, great atmosphere, really lively and the tapas were really delicious (and the sangria wasn't bad either - very good in fact).We went to another restuarant the following evening but it just didn't match the fabulous food of Cerveceria so we found ourselves back there the following evening for more! Second time around was even better as we knew the ropes and although it was a 45 minute wait for a table, it didn't dissappoint. The place was very busy right up until we left at 11pm, when people were still arriving to eat . Had we been in Barca a little longer no doubt we would have been queueing up again!Doesn't break the bank either, prices are very reasonable indeed compared to what you can pay. Remember you cannot reserve a table in advance, so if you don't want to wait a while, have your lunch or dinner early! (ie ~12.30pm or ~ 8pm)."
5206,9-05-2011 ,2.0,"I used to like this place to take my visitors friends...but it's getting a too touristic, the waiting time is too long and the diversity of tapas is so so..Service is also getting a bit rude... It's still worth a visit if you are near the place."
5207,5-05-2011 ,5.0,"Visited this place having read the good reviews on here, and it was close to our hotel.We had a 45 minute wait for a table, but it was more than worth it. The food was superb and the environment was enjoyable. We enjoyed our visit here so much that we went back for a second meal two night later! (Wait time 20 mins).I would not hesitate to recommend this place - if you are prepared to wait for a table."
5208,5-05-2011 ,4.0,"I really wanted to return here on our visit, but just couldn't get through the door, it was so busy. I'd recommend people come for lunch, or even for breakfast, as we ended up doing.Breakfast isn't tapas, but rather a wonderful array of little sandwiches, good coffee and fresh orange juice. They did meet my request for a tortilla (potato omelette) too! The sandwiches were really good, fresh and constantly replenished as we watched. Particularly recommended is the cheese sandwich - something mildly blue, a sort of firm ricotta, something hard and possibly sheepy - more than the sum of its parts, and one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time."
5209,2-05-2011 ,4.0,After reading the good reviews we decided to try this restaurant on our first night in Barcelona. We arrived around 8pm when it was very busy and put our name down for a table with the friendly maitre d'. We only waited about 20mins. The bar area was rammed and we couldn't get to order drinks while we waited for our table. When we were led into the restaurant it was still quite rowdy and gave me the feel of a cafe. The staff were busy but quite attentive. The food and wine was reasonably priced and delicious. I would have preferred somewhere quieter but this type of eating seems to be quite popular in Barcelona. This place just wasn't what I was expecting but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend it if you like a rowdy atmosphere.
5210,27-04-2011 ,5.0,"Absolutely love this place. I don't normally like tapas, but Cerveceria Catalana has converted me. Food was exquisite, and very reasonably priced. We had 5 plates each plus a jug of sangria (beautiful) and the bill came to 39 euros. I have honestly never eaten such good food. Real range as well. They had everything from mini hamburgers, meats, cheeses, seafood, salads, to little tostadas with just about anything you could think of on top.It was absolutely heaving with people when we went in. Bit confusing as we didn't know whether to wait for a table at the bar, or to queue - turns out you have to put you name down for a table as soon as you arrive as it gets packed very quickly. This was a good sign! Although there were a lot of people waiting for a table, the staff did not rush you whatsoever. They were very kind and polite, and the food came very quickly. We went back the day after as we couldn't get enough!"
5211,26-04-2011 ,4.0,"My wife and I enjoyed a dinner here after recommendations from a local chef we met in Barcelona. Its all about the tapas and this is what fills the entire menu, with lots of options covering both catalan and spanish traditions, but all presented and influenced in a modern manner. We ordered 6 different tapas between us and were too full for dessert, but of course it depends on the size of each dish you happen to choose. The food was quite good and we were not dissapointed with any of our choices. Make sure you arrive around 7pm or make a booking, because it fills up quickly with local after workers and tourists alike."
5212,26-04-2011 ,5.0,The food was excellent and really yummy. If you like to try all the different foods from spain. It was really busy on the sunday night. We had to wait 15 min till we got seated. We went there 2 days later and the waiting time was up to 45 min. So we decided not to stay. I recommend to make a reservation.
5213,21-04-2011 ,5.0,"Went here on last night of an eight night stay - wish we had found it before. Got a seat at the bar after a couple of rounds of drinks stood nearby soaking up the great atmosphere. Food was wonderful - grilled cuttlefish, shrimp, pate and cheese, and unlike us, two great desserts. Service was great as well. Impressed."
5214,20-04-2011 ,5.0,Don't be put off by the hoards of people. I would recommend it for a lunch venue in between your touring around the city. We ate sat at the bar and really you can enjoy the buzz! The dishes have a creative twist and we thought it was the best tapas we ever had. The service was friendly and the staff are working very hard!
5215,17-04-2011 ,3.0,Good first impression. But once seated we felt forgotten. Good food without exceeding expectations. 
5216,16-04-2011 ,5.0,"Very crowded but worth the wait. Every time I traveled to Barcelona, I would not miss eating at this restaurant. This is my fifth time eating here and still love the food and the atmosphere. It is definitely one of the best tapas restaurant in town."
5217,10-04-2011 ,4.0,It was extremely crowded on a Friday night; we wentback on Saturday for early lunch instead. The food was decent but a bit overly salty for my liking. The price was very reasonable for the upscale decor and friendly service.
5218,8-04-2011 ,5.0,"Went to Catalana on strong recommendation and we were not disappointed. The food is fresh, delicious and local. Despite if being off from Las Rambla, it does not lack atmosphere. If you can manage noise and lively bustle, get a seat at the bar where you can see all the action. Be prepared to wait if you arrive without booking especially after 8pm. We loved the food that much, we saved it for our last night in the lovely Barcelona. And no other tapas bar met the quality and value we found at this gastronomic adventure. If you are a 'foodie' then this is a must!!"
5219,6-04-2011 ,5.0,"This restaurant was recommended to us multiple times, we we had to try it. We went for dinner on a Saturday night - the place was packed and the wait long. After fighting for 2 seats at the bar, we decided that's where we would stay. All of the tapas ordered was AMAZING - the razor clams were to die for and the risotto was the best I've ever had. Wine is a steal at 1.75 Euro a glass - and their sangria is excellent. If this place was near me, I'd be a regular for sure!!"
5220,26-03-2011 ,5.0,"I stayed in Barcelona for 7 days in September of 2010 with my boyfriend. We tried to stay away from typical touristy areas when getting food as we wanted to experience non-tourist trap restaurants. However, all restaurants kept on coming up short. After 4 days of very average food we were pretty disappointed by the food in Barcelona. A friend who had been to Barcelona had recommended this place and off we went. We stopped for lunch and it was amazing! We ate at the bar as there was no wait and it was great. Interacted with the staff and loved having each dish be consistently delicious. We came back that night for dinner and did have to wait at least an hour. However, the location is pretty good and you can go away and wander into shops while you wait. As for the food, the prawn croquette is phenomenal, the asparagus are sooo delicious, the escalivada with goat cheese on top is very yummy. Although not authentic the mini hamburguesas are great, and the veal is delicious. Also the sangria is a must! Everything at this place is done very well and is extremely flavourful. Definitely the best food find in Barcelona!"
5221,23-03-2011 ,4.0,"seafood is fantastic , cheap and fresh!try everything on the daily menu!DO reserve a table!"
5222,13-03-2011 ,5.0,The food was extremely tasty and fresh.Served quicklyCheapWe love this rest!
5223,6-03-2011 ,4.0,"My son and I visited for lunch - confirming other reviews, food is excellent and service a bit pushy. But that's part of the fun of tapas - you can choose quickly and whimsically, without worrying that you've made a big mistake. One suggestion - if at all possible, go with someone who knows some Catalan and can translate the specials menu (as far as I can tell, only available in that language). My son was able to identify about two thirds of them, and the ones I had (canellones and mussels) were outstanding. And don't skip dessert."
5224,6-03-2011 ,4.0,"Cerveceria has a huge variety of tapas reasonably priced... It's usually packed so make sure you are prepared to wait about 30 min. I like it because it gives you the chance to try a lot of different tapas! obviously the service is not great, but then again, Barcelona as a city does not have friendly staff!"
5225,26-02-2011 ,4.0,Tapas the way you'd expect it in modern-day Barcelona. Service could be a bit more attentive.
5226,22-02-2011 ,5.0,"Came there a sunday and it was crowded. Easy to get in and get to talk with the headwaiter and sign us up for a table. We waited for 40 minutes which was excellent. Chilled in the bar and had a couple of beers, watching people sitting/ordering in the bar. The food looked delicious and we had a glance at the menu which all seemed very reasonable priced, dishes from 4-10 euros.Our party of 4 had to wait 50 minutes to get in and got a big round table for 8 people, thinking they would seat somebody else with us, but no.This table was really close to the kitchen and it was great fun observing the staff running around.We had a full lunch/dinner with Sangria and desert for 4 people, costed us €75 which was really reasonable. I'd go to this place next time I visit Barcelona."
5227,20-02-2011 ,4.0,"Was a little wary due to the negative reviews, but this restaurant was recommended by several friends of mine who have been before, so we went. We were there at about 7:30pm on a Saturday night, and it was busy. We waited about 15 minutes for a table. The hostess and waiters seemed hurried, yes, but they were accommodating and good-spirited. We do not speak any Spanish, and they were very helpful and joked around with us. I enjoyed it. The food was pretty damn good too. We just ordered a ton of different things, not exactly knowing what we were getting. Everything was delish. It was also reasonably priced... about 8 or 9 tapas and 2 beers was 48 Euros. It was a very fun place to go on our first night in Barcelona. I would recommend it."
5228,13-02-2011 ,4.0,"Got recommended by the hotel receptionists and was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the food. Very good and tasty tapas, however the service was poor. Fresh and well cooked food!"
5229,13-02-2011 ,3.0,"I think the restaurant was OK but not that special from a food and service point of view. I really do not understand the excitement around this restaurant. We went there for a Sunday brunch and it was really crowded. Service was superquick but I would say too much and the food was OK but not comparable to CalPep or Origen or other similar tapas restaurants. Filled up with tourist, I did not enjoyed too much. But he prices are quite reasonable. Give it try, as it still seems quite popular amongst Catalans."
5230,8-02-2011 ,3.0,"Cerveceria Catalana was busy every time we passed it in the evenings, so we decided to go for lunch on our last day in Barcelona. To be honest it was a little disappointing having read the glowing reviews here. The food was ok, well cooked, and a good variety, but was expensive compared to some of the other places around, and the experience left me feeling that it was more style over substance. The layout is impressive, but for a ""Catalan Brewery"" the large range of international beers on display compared to the lack of locally brewed drinks was disappointing. The staff were attentive but (and strangely) we felt they were a little on the hard sell for some of the more expensive items on the menu. The wine list was however, well priced with plenty of local options.The Crema Catalana dessert was the saving grace, which came with a sugar topping which it took a good thump to break - always a good sign in my wife's eyes!All together a little bit disappointing, and I left with the feeling that our €40 lunch would have delivered better value elsewhere"
5231,7-02-2011 ,4.0,"A little bemused by some of the negative reviews. I went with the husband, his sister and her husband. It isn't cheap but it is not pricey, and certainly feels worth it once the food starts arriving. The tapas is divine, it's a busy place and the service is a littloe rushed, but that is the nature of the place.Try the manchego, green peppers, fried artichoke, mushrooms with garlic and mini burgers. great breads and hams."
5232,7-02-2011 ,4.0,"My friend and I went here for dinner based on trip advisor rating. We walked from the centre (near the fountains) and walked passed many restaurants but none as busy as this place.Full of locals and tourists spilling out on the the street, we had to put our name on a waiting list for about an hour but it was fine as we stood at the bar with a bottle of wine. It was busy and you do get knocked into but it was all part of the fun, some people were eating tapas at the bar and others waiting for a table.It is bright lit and the lady who takes the booking was very funny....which made it better when I asked about our table again (slight delay). The food was fresh and tasty...you are close to other tables so I would not recommend if you want a romantic night out. But the service was quick and we ordered tapas a few times.I would go again."
5233,2-02-2011 ,2.0,"The restaurant is busy and obviously popular. We were seated straight away. We were given menus and asked were we ready to order by 3 waiters within the first 2 minutes! The waiting staff are unfriendly, disinterested, unhelpful and it seemed that they were in a big hurry. Our food was served very quickly indeed, it was good but not great. We ordered the house red, it was very good. Overall a very rushed experience, I would not recommend this place, try somewhere else where the staff appreciate your custom."
5234,1-02-2011 ,2.0,"me and boyfriend went there at 7 o'clock and it was already getting busy. First bad thing - we have been located straight next to the waitress space, where everyone was passing all the time, almost stepping on your feets. passed 8 it became really crowded, loud and service got pretty pushy, by literally taking the plates from you while you where still eating. Even the food was excellent, still poorly served and overpriced. We also discovered that for the tourists you have different menu than for the locals which unfortunatelly reduces the number of offered tapas and dishes. I found it not so nice that the waitress did not have will and time to explain us and help us to discover the Spanish Tapas specialities, because at the end what the locals next to us got on their plates looked very much amazing. So maybe i will go there - but for sue with some spanish firends and this time will say directly to the waitress not to take the plate from my nose (even there are people waiting outside in the line)."
5235,16-01-2011 ,5.0,"We stumbled across this place 3 years ago and have been back several times since - both for drinks, tapas and sit down meal. It never disappoints."
5236,9-01-2011 ,5.0,"This place is outstanding in terms of service, atmosphere, food quality and price. It is always busy, but you don't have to wait for long. We were here for a long weekend and went twice, it was that good. You will pay double the price for a vastly inferior experience. Go. You will not regret it."
5237,6-01-2011 ,5.0,"We were looking for a decent tapas style restaurant but had no idea how to find one so we turned to Trip Advisor for help. After reading the reviews we took a chance and grabbed a cab from the W Barcelona, gave the driver the address and arrived about 10 minutes later. The place was crowded (about 7:00 pm) but we were called to a table within 5 minutes.Every dish we ordered was superb. Ham, cheese plates, fresh anchovies, delicious calamari, mini burgers (super yummy), etc. I can't remember all that we ordered but we ate like pigs and ordered seconds for some things. The food is fresh, hot and comes out very fast. It's a feast! Even my kids loved it.Servers were very efficient and polite.The bill was about 75 Euros and that included a nice bottle of wine and a few beer. We were so impressed that we returned the following night and had just as great food and service as the night before."
5238,20-12-2010 ,3.0,"Food was just ok, and the service was not too friendly. Cool area of town but I'd rather just go find a little bodega in Mercado Bouquería"
5239,15-12-2010 ,4.0,"The best tasting tapas I've had in Barcelona. The place has changed over the years from a traditional setting to a much more sleek and modern feel now, but the food is still great. Portions have shrunk from a few years ago but it's the quality of food that you are paying for. Easier to take a taxi unless you know where you are going or are good with the map. The place is busy at most times but more so into the evening as this is the time the locals go out. Check in with the host who will advise of waiting times and have a beer or wine at the bar. I've never waited more that 20 mins. English menu available. Skip the more 'run-of-the-mill' tapas such as patatas bravas as these are pretty much the same anywhere you go. House wine was under 10Euros a bottle last time I went (Nov 10). Great experience . Busy. Lots of chatter. Very popular with locals and tourists"
5240,7-12-2010 ,5.0,"We discovered this tapas bar on tripadvisor, it wasn't really near any main landmarks but very easy to access from the Diagonal metro stop. Get there earlier than you want to eat as you will have to wait 30 minutes or so. You can then either have a drink at the bar or go to another cafe just around the corner for when your table is free. The wait is definately worth it, the staff offer a very good service and the food is fantastic at very affordable prices. We went 4 times and our most expensive bill was 59 euros. For that we got 9/10 very filling tapas dishes, 2 deserts, water and a bottle of wine.Our personal recomendations are the croquettes, bravas potatoes, mushrooms and the mini hotdogs and hamburgers! I have probably forgot a few!Definately go visit Cerveceria Catalana!"
5241,3-12-2010 ,5.0,We ate here twice during out stay we liked it so much. There are so many amazing & wonderful tapas to choose from! The sangria & wine are also wonderful. We were shocked by how inexpensive everything was and we absolutely loved that it's a non smoking restaurant! And it was open on Sunday when nothing else was. If I were local I would eat here all the time!
5242,30-11-2010 ,5.0,"We are hard-core foodies! We take more photos of food when we travel than of sites and this place is amazing. We have taken cooking classes on tapas at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa and fell in love with Cerveseria Catalana. We went there three times and never were disappointed. The skewered ham, date, and cheese brochette (see photo) was amazing as was the red pepper stuffed with cod (bacalao) and cheese. Some of the wait staff speak English but we pointed if we had to. Most nights there are lots of crowds after 9:30 p.m. but that adds to the excitement and fun! It's always entertaining to people-watch and talk to others who are waiting. (There are English-speaking tourists, but you are not surrounded by them!) Or, you can go for tapas late afternoon (around 5:00 p.m.) We are still talking about how wonderful their tapas was! If you can't get in, Paco Meralgo in the same neighborhood (Eixample, near Paseo del Gracia) is also superb."
5243,29-11-2010 ,5.0,"I just returned from Barcelona for a short holiday (5 days). We ate 3 times in this restaurant.The food is really excellent. If you arrive between 07:00-07:30pm there is hardly a que, but after 08:00pm it's crazy people are standing in the que, not only tourists but also locals.It's also possible to sit on the counter, you can see all the delicious tapas in front of you hmmmm.The staff is working very hard, but sometimes loose the overview and we had to wait long for first our drinks, but the great tapas compensated all the waiting.....;-)Will definitely return to Cerveceria Catalana!"
5244,17-11-2010 ,5.0,"One of the best food, perfect service. Always crowded, but you need to ""register"" at managers desk, wait 15-20 minutes and you will be seated. You can also try to take a seat next to bar - if you are lucky.It may be a little difficult to explain in English what you want to order, but much easier option is to go to bar and show what you want to try. Very good seafood on tapas.Price depends on how many tapas (sandwiches) you try. 4-8 for a person should be reasonable. You can also order some other dishes from menu.Price of one tapas should be around 1,8-2,5 EUR. Bottle of wine is around 10 EUR or less. Perfectly organizes service.You also need to try dessert. Lemon cream cake and catalunya style cream (creme brulee) were one of the best we ever tried.Highly recommended."
5245,6-11-2010 ,4.0,"You will have to wait at this popular tapas bar, but do it. We loved the food, but then we love eating a lot of different things - so we are made for tapas. Service was very good - friendly to Americans. Not a quiet place - but heck, it is not supposed to be."
5246,2-11-2010 ,3.0,"We stayed in Barcelona 4 days and we tried many tapas restaurant. This is a good place but not so different from many other. You don't need to wait if you want to seat at the bar. The tapas was the same (really, the same!) that we found in Ciudad Condal restaurant. Good prices."
5247,1-11-2010 ,5.0,"We came here for lunch in August 2010 on a Sunday, and then came back the same night for late night eats. For the foodies, sit at the bar so that you can get the full affect. Staff is very friendly and the menu can please everyone. Seafood, meats, veggies, cheeses,etc. This place will not disappoint! If the tapas bar is not your thing, it has a large dining area and a decent sized patio."
5248,30-10-2010 ,5.0,"We travel with a 9 year old and this spot was a WIN for us all! We are not the late evening diners so nom line, no wait and excellent food and service!"
5249,27-10-2010 ,5.0,we had lunch at this restaurant...and we were not disappointed...very good food with very quick service..would love to go again...
5250,27-10-2010 ,4.0,"Based on our experience from the day before we went here early, about 8 pm. There was already a lot of people but we put ourselves on the waiting list and got a table after about 30 minutes.After being seated and reading our English language menu we noted that the English menu lacked the ""tapas of the day list"" which was present in the Spanish menu the people seated next to us had. Upon our request the waitress brought us the special menu and translated it for us and I´m glad she did. The special menu contained a lot of seafood, like clams, and other specials.We ate a mix of 6 dishes from both the regular and the special menu plus a dessert and it was all really good food for a good price. This place is definitely worth a visit. If you, like us, don´t speak Spanish keep an eye out for the ""tapas of the day list"" and get it translated - it will improve the experience."
5251,26-10-2010 ,5.0,"Myself and my boyfriend ate at Cerveceria Catalana on our last night in Barcelona, and we were really impressed with the standard of both the food and service. The restaurant was packed to the brim, but the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. During our trip we tried tapas at about 5 different restaurants around the city, but this was by far the best. The food is really well-priced too. Very, very highly recommended!"
5252,24-10-2010 ,5.0,Best tapas restaurant in Barcelona that we visited. Had the most unusual tapas in BCN. We found that a lot of the restaurants had the SAME tapas...this restaurant had refreshing choices. Excellent service too-we found that other restaurants were lacking in this. We would definitely return if ever in Barcelona again!
5253,24-10-2010 ,4.0,"This restaurant was always packed whenever we passed. We had read the TripAdvisor reviews and fancied trying it, but the crowds put us off. Eventually, on a Wednesday night, we took the plunge and got a table after only a half-hour wait.Once seated, we were almost immediately approached by a waiter asking what we'd like to eat. As we hadn't even read the menu yet, we asked for more time - he reappeared about two minutes later whilst we were still deciding. He was visibly miffed at us taking so long. Service on the whole was poor - perhaps the staff are a little overworked? We saw one poor chap disappearing into a backroom with a bowl of plain rice - if I worked amongst all that beautiful food I'd hope for a prawn at least!!Anyway, back to the restaurant. The food was good, but as another reviewer mentioned, we felt a bit left out that we couldn't understand the ""specials"" section of the menu, where I suspect the real gems lay.I would recommend this place for the hustle bustle vibe, the classy decor and the decent (but not brilliant) food. I am not sure why it is quite so packed every night, but it's definitely worth a visit."
5254,23-10-2010 ,4.0,"Went here on our first night in Barcelona on a Wed, arrived at about 9:45 and waited 20 mins for a table with a glass of house wine, nice quality. Really busy and noisy but good fun. An English menu made life easier but we noticed that the Spanish menu had daily specials so felt a bit left out. Ordered some green chillis, fillet veal steak, salad and razor clams. The food was fine, the veal was great and we ordered another. We had to send the razor clams back as full of grit which was unfortunate. There were a few belgium beers in the fridge along with a good range of other beers and wines. Overall I rated this highly as it is a good experience but we didn't go back as too many other places to try and the food was just ok. We also walked past on a Sunday night and it was crazy busy, not sure I could be bothered on a weekend."
5255,21-10-2010 ,5.0,"Found the restaurant to be very popular with both locals and tourists - it appears in at least one major guide book so the word is spreading. Seems to be v busy from early in the evening, in spite of locals' habit of dining late. But I found it to be worth waiting around a bit for a seat. My friend and I decided to sit up at the counter near the entrance, where you can see all the fresh seafood behind glass and, I would imagine, get served rather quicker. Tapas were very good, reasonably priced. Service was very good too: for some reason most of the staff in the bar/counter area seemed to be Filipinos."
5256,20-10-2010 ,4.0,"We stayed at a hotel near by, so we passed this place every time we'd come and go. At first we were thrilled, it was really fun and certainly good. A great place to people watch. After a few days, we grew tired of the crowds and of being jostled. We also deduced that there was too much hype about the place. We found less crowded, less touristy places a few blocks away, close to Valencia Street, still with great food, but much more relaxing."
5257,19-10-2010 ,4.0,"There is such a load of people going in and out and waiters rushing around that it feels a bit like a fast food or something. The atmosphere isnt there.However, it is still probably worth a visit. I would recommend it to grab a bite at daytime when there are no queues (it is extremely popular!). The menu also is more for lunchtime meal rather than late evening as the restaurant specializes on tapas. Since it is very conveniently located, the food is very good and the prices are not very high it would be a good choice."
5258,13-10-2010 ,5.0,"We knew we hit the jackpot when we saw people spilling out of the restaurant, enjoying drinks while waiting for tables...we were told the wait was an hour, but it didn't take long for us to get a great seat at the bar, where we were free to ask the English-speaking Filipino staff what they recommended. The Sangria was only 10 Euro/jug & every single tapa we sampled was truly delicious! We probably ate more than we should have, but the bill, including drinks & tip was only ~56 Euros."
5259,11-10-2010 ,5.0,"After being ripped off at a restaurant on La Ramblas (live and learn), we decided to give this restaurant a try. What a treat, and boy do we regret not going to this one our first night in Barcelona.The food was excellent, the sangra was amazing, the service was impeccable and attentive. Our server took the time to go through their 'night specials' with us, and we were delighted with a few of the tasty treats not found on their regular menu. Everything we had was delicious, especially their version of what we would call a 'poutine' here in Canada. It consisted of crispy thing french fries, seasoned perfectly with an egg on top - with just the right balance of heat. It was so good - we had 2 plates of this. After countless dishes of tapas and a big jug of sangria, we asked for a bill - expecting to see something that would put a hefty dent in our wallets (again, we were thoroughly ripped off at a restaurant on Las Ramblas). The bill came and we were shocked that it didn't even come close to our first night's dinner, and we definitely ate WAY more here at this restaurant. This restaurant will definitely be a return for us, if we ever find ourselves in Barcelona again."
5260,11-10-2010 ,5.0,"We were delighted when we got the bill at this restaurant after having a horrible experience at another Tapas restaurant that was closer to the Ramblas.This place offered awesome tapas and great service. The waitress took the time to explain every single special tapa of the day (20 of them) as they were only written in Spanish. We started with a pitcher of Sangria and ordered a large selection of tapas, one highlight was fries with a special hot sauce and sunny side up egg on top. We ended up ordering 3 of them! The seafood was also fresh and tasted great! We were absolutely shocked when the bill came and it was only 150 Euro. We quickly realized we had been taken the night before at the other restaurant. This place is classy, clean and modern and must not be missed!"
5261,10-10-2010 ,3.0,The food is very average and the service is poor to rude.
5262,7-10-2010 ,5.0,"I have been to a couple tapas restaurants in my life but this place blows away any place in the states I have been to and is much better than Cal Pep which some people said is much better than this place.We arrived here around 8 PM which is early for dinner in Barcelona since most people eat at 10 PM. The place was actually busy this early but we managed to get two seats at the bar right away. After about 20 minutes there was a wait to get in this place. Upon walking in you feel like you're at a sushi bar because so much of the food is displayed for you to choose from. The atmosphere, food, and service here was spectacular. The only thing I like better in the states is the Sangria. We left here completely stuffed and only spent 40 euro's for two of us. I could eat at this place on a daily basis with no problem."
5263,6-10-2010 ,4.0,"and i don't even really like patata bravas! but i was really impressed with this place. budget-wise and quality of food, we ate quite well. and i'm quite picky."
5264,5-10-2010 ,4.0,"This restaurant is crowdy and serves very good tapas. The selection is wide and each of the tapas we ordered were tasty, in particular the veal loin and the cod. Pricing is very affordable since it costs less than 20 Euros / person, wine included. The restaurant is centrally located. If you want to eat at this restaurant, show up early since we had to wait approximately 40 minutes to get a table. The only caveat is the service where the waiters are putting some pressure to get you out of the restaurant as soon as you have finished eating."
5265,5-10-2010 ,4.0,"standard tapas fare on the menu. enjoyed my meal, but enjoyed the cava sangria more. the service wasn't particularly good - waiter rushed us through the meal, and then out the door. nevertheless, i would still choose to return. i recommend ordering the foie flautas."
5266,4-10-2010 ,4.0,"Went here on a recent birthday trip to Barcelona after a friend recommended it and reading the reviews on here. We waited 50 minutes for table. The food was lovely, until we decided to order one last dish. Having admired others eating some seafood dishes we decided to order the razor clams... sadly this spoilt our dinner. They were gritty, which meant they hadn't been cleaned properly, the intestines were still there and they were very chewy. Despite this mishap we would still recommend the Cerveceria."
5267,1-10-2010 ,5.0,"We have been in Spain 2 weeks, and this is by far the best Tapas we have had. Bear in mind, that in Spain, the main meal is to be eaten at lunch around 2PM, and dinner consists of tapas, small meals. We sat a the bar of hot tapas (there's another side which is making cold tapas, but you order either). We had typical bread, spread with tomatos and Iberian Ham, Calamare (squid), and Camembert coated with almonds. Together with olives and wine, that was enough for us. We saw countless variations of tapas being served, pork, beef tenderloin, clams of lots of varieties, shrimp (the same). I can't wait to go back tonite."
5268,30-09-2010 ,5.0,"After traveling through the Basque country in France and Spain and after having many fancy and memorable meals, we wanted to dine in an informal and fun atmosphere and also experience wonderful, fresh food. Our first dinner at Catalana was so good and so much fun, that we returned three times during our stay in Barcelona. The greet staff was gracious and helpful, the waitstaff was sensitive and encourage an adventurous spirit and the food was fresh, hot and beautifully presented--all-in-all it was an amazing cultural and culinaryexperience."
5269,29-09-2010 ,5.0,"Came across this restaurant by chance and waited a few minutes to get a seat outside as the sun was shining and the food looked so good! Really good tapas served here. You can pick from the extensive range and then it is brought to your table either hot or cold depending on choice. Nice beer as well. Great service by a Spanish/Moroccon/ Scotsman!!! Highly recommended, great food but not if you're on a budget! Worth a try though just limit the amount of tapas you pick!"
5270,24-09-2010 ,1.0,"When dining in Barcelona, one doesn't expect restaurant servers to speak perfect English or to be Asian. This was the first sign that we were in for an inauthentic crappy dinner at Cerveceria Catalana. At first glance, this place holds great promise. It's packed, it has a good atmosphere in the bar area, and, and it seems like a neighborhood/local sort of place. This is all an act. We strayed from Rick and trusted the reviews on my iPhone Trip Advisor app. We were very sorry to have done so. The tortilla espanola was like eating a block of scrambled eggs and even the manchego cheese plate didn't taste right. After only a few dishes, we decided to scram and not waste any more money on highly mediocre food. I've always had luck using Trip Advisor for hotel reviews, but I will be very cautious about using it for restaurant reviews if this is what patrons consider a great meal in Barcelona. I had been warned by a few reviewers that this place wasn't worth it. I figure that they were grumpy dissenters and that this many people couldn't be wrong. Instead, they turned out to be the lone voices of reason. Don't bother with anything more than a drink. You'll be able to order it easily because there is nothing Spanish about this place beyond its name."
5271,21-09-2010 ,5.0,"We went there twice on our trip to Barcelona. The waiter at our hotel recommended it as it was nearby the Hotel Alexandra where we were staying. Our first visit there was late in the afternoon, around 4pm. It was our first dining experience in Spain so we may have been a little bit easily impressed, but the food was great! The fried sardines were delicious. I didn't think I would like them, but they are addictive. Also the potatas bravas were by far the best we had on our trip. They were lightly fried and the sauce was great.Also, get the roasted peppers with salt. Very unique and also highly addictive! On our second visit we went for dinner.... we had to wait for a table- it was packed! We sat at the bar and drank the house wine, which will run you around 1.50 euro/glass! Great value!"
5272,20-09-2010 ,5.0,"Wentbthere based on reviews, and hotel recommendation, then place Is buzzing, have to wait for a seat, be prepared, the food is fresh, great, and excellently priced, it's a great place to have excellent tapas, sit with friends and enjoy your time, it is worth the visit, and the price is magnificent."
5273,18-09-2010 ,5.0,Great food that attracts you when you just look at the display.Great Sangria.Always full so you have to wait for a seat.
5274,17-09-2010 ,5.0,"Don't listen to the last reviewer this place is absolutely amazing worth the 45 minute wait. We ordered about 12 Tapas for the 3 of us consisting of calamari, potatoes, seafood salad, prawns, bread, omelette, bottle of wine, Vodka. We were all so full we could barely eat breakfast the next day. The food and drink is cheap as the bill came to under $60E, after we paid the waiter gave us complementary coffee. What more could you ask from a restaurant?"
5275,12-09-2010 ,3.0,"this restaurant is raved about on this site and we followed our guide book recommendation and gave it a shot. It was very busy and the service very rushed and impersonal. in the end we managed to squeeze in at the bar which is loaded up with food. We tried ham sandwiches, a mayonnaise salad and some fried squid. All was acceptable but not in any way out of the ordinary. Didn't really seem to have local cuisine, it was more of a factory atmosphere."
5276,9-09-2010 ,5.0,"We were told there'd be a wait.....and an hour and a half in this buzzing place went by quickly, the food is great value and delicious. Impeccable service, a Must-Visit!"
5277,4-09-2010 ,5.0,"Based on the Trip Advisor rating for good value our family went to the Cereceria and was not disappointed. In fact, we went back 3 times. Great food (Prawns and Sirloin on the brucetta is a must) We spen a lot of time in restraurants and have been to some very expensive places and been underwhelmed. This ticked the box on value and quality, just go and make you own mind up.EnjoyRegards"
5278,31-08-2010 ,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in Barcelona, especially if you want to experience true Catalan cuisine without breaking the budget! Cerveceria Catalana is insanely popular among tourists and locals alike, and it's not hard to see why - delicious fresh tapas made from quality ingredients, good portions and great prices.The menu doesn't do a great job of describing the spectacular tapas, so it's often easier to sit at the bar and point to what you want. We loved it so much we visited 3 times over 5 days!"
5279,28-08-2010 ,5.0,"Really nice food, well priced, good atmosphere. We had 20min wait, but we just waited outside with a nice cool beer! Best tapas I had in Barca!"
5280,24-08-2010 ,5.0,Loved it so much we went their twice. Waited a bit both times but worth it. Best value meal in Barcelona...famiy of 4 ate until we were full with great bottle of wine for under $50 euros.
5281,23-08-2010 ,5.0,"You might have to wait for admission, but it's all worth it."
5282,22-08-2010 ,5.0,"We tool a cue from the other reviews and arrived around 7:15 PM and were able to snag the last table outside. We got a mixed plate, plus chorizo bocadillos, the grilled cuttlefish, and Russian salad, all of which were delicious. Excellent food at very reasonable prices considering the quality of cuisine."
5283,19-08-2010 ,3.0,"After reading the reviews here I was looking forward to a culinary experience however I have to say I was dissapointed. It was average at best. The food was chruned out to the masses and was heavily salted. The service was efficient but far from friendly as the plates were plonked down on the table with little or no interaction. However for the location I have to day it was reasonable priced. As for the atmosphere, well I would consider it just noisy rather than atmospheric and I didn't see many locals."
5284,18-08-2010 ,5.0,"Reading previous reviews I have to agree with the fact that the place is indeed crowded and that there is a woman taking reservation as you walk in and there might be some waiting time, it's true. Why though? Because the place is so popular. Why then? Because the food is so good.We really love Tapas and Pintxos and we usually like choosing and eating them right at the bar. There were no stools available at the bar when we arrived but after a 5-min wait we were already savouring a really nice sangria.The food is on another level altogether. It is simple and delicious. We ordered a selection of all their salads as well as 4 or 5 Tapas and they were all good, with some verging on the mind-blowing. Some classics, like the fish à la plancha and the tortilla were out of this world.What's more even though the food is great and the place is a hit, ""la quenta"" was actually not that expensive at all, sangria, selection of salads and 4 or 5 Tapas for something like 35€, not bad considering we couldn't even finish what we ordered.The place also seemed to do take-away...Will recommend it to anyone looking for a Tapas place in Barcelona, definitely."
5285,15-08-2010 ,2.0,"The rave reviews here are terribly misleading. Barcelona is in many ways the culinary capital of the world, but the food is trashy, incompetent, and not at all fresh. It seems to be a cafeteria for the masses. If you want to go somewhere where you'll be eating ""safe"" food, that you will neither like nor dislike, this is the place for you."
5286,12-08-2010 ,5.0,"There is a reason this restaurant gets such rave reviews - it is THAT good! Not only is it a hot spot for visitors and tourists, but it is a local hotspot as well.My wife and I ate there on our honeymoon. We arrived shortly after 9 pm and the place was packed. We ordered a pitcher of sangria from the bar while we waited on a table. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but were seated within 30 minutes. The restaurant has lovely decor - great for either a night out with friends or a romantic meal with your special someone. We saw quite a few couples, as well as a few large (6+) groups. While the atmosphere is great, the food is even better. From the first bite to the last, we were in awe of the food. Typically at a tapas bar, you expect small portions of each item you order - that was not the case. Each item we ordered brought out enough for my wife and I each to have some, and to be satisfied with what we ate. *Note for you American travelers - while you can continue to order, tapas in Spain is a bit different than the tapas bars back in the states. You order everything you want up front (except desert) and they bring it to you as it is prepared. Though, the waiters understand we do things differently, so feel free to keep ordering as the night goes on if you want. We ordered 7 different items from the menu, each of which was excellent, and then had dessert. The Catalonian Creme (which is essentially creme brule) was excellent, as was the chocolate souffle cake. The food is well priced. The sangria was only 15 euro for the pitcher, and the meal was less than 30 euro. The food was excellent, the service was great, the sangria was some of the best I've ever had. Find time and spend a night dining at the Cerverceria Catalana."
5287,11-08-2010 ,5.0,"we got here around 10pm and were told there was an hour wait. We ended up getting seats at the bar 10 minutes later and ate there. The sangria was very good and the tapas were amazing. The shrimp brochettes were my favorite, as well as the little green fried peppers. It is very busy and packed and the hostess was not super friendly, but the people behind the bar/tapas counter were great."
5288,6-08-2010 ,5.0,"After looking for a good tapas resturant in barcelona I decided we should try cerveccia catalana. It was about 5-10 minutes walk from were we stayed and when we arrived there it was about one and half hour wait. We decied to stay and we finally sat down, we realised we had made the right desicion. the food tasted exellent, with the high points being the potatas bravas and fried green peapars! The sercvices was verry good aswell, the atmosphere and interior was nice. We were so pleasd that we decided to go there for our finally evening in barcelona."
5289,5-08-2010 ,4.0,"There are daunting crowds every night, but the tapas is excellent, fresh, and worth coming back for. We had supper there on a busy Weds and again on Thurs night, many excellent choices, all fresh, beautiful and tasty. Fried seafood (squid, anchovies) were not greasy nor over-salted, but delicious. Veal was tender, spanish omelette amazing, and the mushrooms and asparagus fresh picked and nicely seasoned. Dessert favorites- warm chocolate cake, creme catalana, homemade cake all worth saving room for. Service was prompt once you negotiated the wait, easily 45 minutes+ at 9PM."
5290,3-08-2010 ,5.0,Top quality tapas right in the center of barcelona. Mix of locals and tourists this place has Nerver disappointed us. We love sitting at the bar and ... Order!
5291,3-08-2010 ,5.0,"You must try the mini burgers and the sauteed garlic mushrooms! There is also a vast beer selection, my favorite is the Leffe Blonde."
5292,2-08-2010 ,4.0,"This is a very good restaurant for tapas. It's very busy, the first time we arrived quite late which is never a good idea in Spain and were told the wait would be 40 mins. we were really hungry and decided to go elsewhere (which was a mistake). We returned the next day much earlier and enjoed excellent tapas and the house red for very good value. The service isn't overally friendly but that's normal for Spain! Wish we'd found it sooner."
5293,1-08-2010 ,4.0,"We ate lunch at Cerveceria Catalana last month during our pre cruise stay. Originally we planned to have dinner there but after we went to La Pedrera, we realized that it was not far away so we decided to hop over for a quick lunch instead. It was only a little after 12noon but the place was already busy. We saw quite a few locals there. It took a while to get one of the waiters' attention but after that, the service was attentive. The food was very good. We were slightly surprised to find that the Tapas assortment was exactly the same as the ones we got at Ciudad Condal. We loved the grilled peppers there since they were the spicy ones Vs the grilled peppers we got at Ciudad Condal and Taller de Tapas were both non spicy. Price was reasonable given the food quality was very good. The atmosphere was less vibrant and more relaxed compared to Ciudad Condal. We definitely would love to eat there again."
5294,29-07-2010 ,4.0,Always overcrowded but worth of waiting: Taste Tapas!watch your bag!
5295,29-07-2010 ,5.0,"Hi,I ate the three times in three days!Very busy at night, but you can get a drink while waiting, maybe a place at the ‘bar’/tapas bar while waiting. In the day you can get straight in there.The staff were very friendly and helpful.Food was lovely (we also ate at Tallers- woundn't recommend it at all), nice selection.Highly, highly recommened"
5296,21-07-2010 ,4.0,"We found this restaurant to have some of the best tapas in Barcelona. The mini-burgers were delicious and the bacon/fig/brie skewers were also a favourite. We also enjoyed sangria and local beer. I know the wait times can be long, but it's worth it!! And if you can handle eating early, we went around 7:15 and got a table for two right away."
5297,20-07-2010 ,5.0,The taste of the food was excellent.Service was good.My favaorite tapas restaurant in the city.The others were even not close to that restaurant.Do not forget to eat seafood.
5298,15-07-2010 ,5.0,We ate here last night and the food was absolutely divine. We walked in at 8 pm for dinner and were told a table for 2 would be a 40 minute wait or we could try our luck on the bar. We chose to wait and strolled the streets in the meantime. As many people will tell you the wait was well worth it and the food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering. Our meal of approx 6 tapas varieties and soft drinks was 30 euros which was well worth it considering we were too full for dessert. Overall we really enjoyed the meal and I'm looking forward to eating here again on my next visit :) 
5299,15-07-2010 ,3.0,The place was packed but we managed two seats at the tapas bar. The waiters behind the bar were obnoxious and snickering bout the customers. After being in so many friendly tapas bars throughout southern Spain this was unexpected. The food was good and the prices were fair. Maybe we would have enjoyed it better at at a table. But we had no desire to return because we were not made to feel welcome. This was the ONLY place on a 12 day trip that made us feel this way
5300,12-07-2010 ,5.0,"Staff were friendly & warm even if they had limited English (i felt terrible we couldnt speak Spanish). We arrived at 8:30 on a saturday night and only had to wait 10mins, which was pleasant enough to take in the atmosphere while sipping wine. Tapas were perfect in taste, variety, value. Ambience was buzzy, but not noisy. Also the best Sangria we had in Barca. This place serves great honest food at excellent prices. We wish we could have gone back time and time again."
5301,12-07-2010 ,4.0,"I have been there maybe 5-times and always satisfied. Good place for the afternoon, if you wish to come in the evening be prepared for a long queue. It is always full!Very good quality for a good money."
5302,10-07-2010 ,2.0,"Are you feeling nostalgic for your local chain restaurant in Kalispell, Montana? Well here it is, with an Ikea make-over. Or perhaps you crave that familiar taste of stale bread and fishy fish, thrown graciously at you by a waitress on the verge of a nervous breakdown? You need not look elsewhere. Indeed, if you wish to be surrounded by drunk American and British tourists driving said waitress insane - or plan to be one of those tourists - this place is for you. For everyone else, keep looking. There are hundreds of tapas bars in Barcelona that are way better than this. Check out Cuitat Comtal a few blocks south on La Ramblas."
5303,3-07-2010 ,5.0,Wonderful food and sangria.Great selection of tapas.Open even in the afternoon( 16.00-20.00) when many other restaurants are closed.
5304,28-06-2010 ,3.0,"Easy to find off top end of Rambla Catalunya. although lots queing at 8.30pm we got an inside table for 2 straight away. The place was rammed full and we fought our way through the bar to get to our table. Then it was a wirlwind of being given the Tapas menu, wine menu, our food being delivered and the bill received all within 30 minutes. Good - the menu had a really good variety and was very tasty as was the wine and the place was atmospheric. Bad - extremely busy and impersonal and not a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience - not the best tomato bread we had either. Top end of acceptable taking all that into account for price."
5305,22-06-2010 ,5.0,Loved this place. Great atmosphere and delicious food!
5306,21-06-2010 ,4.0,"Very busy - make sure you get there by 8:00 p.m. otherwise you may have to wait a bit for a table. Great selection of tapas, so many that it makes it hard to choose! Everything is great and prices are very reasonable. More authentic tapas even though it is located a few steps from La Rambla."
5307,14-06-2010 ,5.0,"Excellent, well worth a visit. Would recommend to a friend and hoping to go back for a meal on our last night."
5308,8-06-2010 ,5.0,"While there tends to be a crowd waiting to be seated during prime dining hours, this restaurant is worth the wait. Excellent tapas for very reasonable prices have led me to return here four or five times during my three month stay in Barcelona. I would and will highly recommend this restaurant to anybody I know coming to Barcelona."
5309,3-06-2010 ,4.0,"Great tapas, good design, good prices! They speak some English which is helpful!"
5310,1-06-2010 ,3.0,"This place was written up about in so many places and was right around the corner from our hotel. The food was good, but we had much better Tapas in the same area throughout the week. The service was good, but nothing amazing. We sat outside to eat which was nice, but again you can do that everywhere in Barcelona. We went a few times and were told it was a 45 min wait, if that's the case...do not wait! It is not worth it. We went back once during the week for a late lunch and had no issue getting a table."
5311,31-05-2010 ,2.0,"We went to have lunch and were very disappointed. Food was average, service was insolent and the atmosphere lacked personality. The waitress cleared the table before we had finished. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."
5312,30-05-2010 ,5.0,"Went here on recommendations from Tripadvisor and it fully lived up to expectations. Good tapas, great atmosphere and really helpful pleasant staff who were excellent bearing in mind my limited Spanish.Prices were very reasonable as well!"
5313,28-05-2010 ,3.0,"We went to several tapas places on our stay in Barcelona and, sadly, this was our least favorite. Ordinarily, I hate people who say stuff like this, but it was obnoxiously touristy. Lots of Americans, Brits, and Canadians making no effort to speak Spanish, the entitlement of which really, really bothers me—at least try, people! It blows my mind that people expect to be spoken to in English and yet complain loudly in English as though the wait staff can't understand what they are saying—? I also can't stand people who sit there ordering pitcher after pitcher of sangria or worse, slowly sipping a single glass of wine, while watching others wait in an hour+ long queue. I don't really mind waiting, but this was somewhat ridiculous—go to a bar! But enough about the patrons. The place was packed even though we went fairly early, at 8:30ish. Wait was about 45 minutes, so no big deal. We did sit outside, which was nice, but the outdoor seating was not nearly as nice as many other places in BCN, including some nearby. The food was eh. Cuttlefish was definitely the favorite, but most everything else was middling. We ordered 7 between the two of us, which was more than enough—we were stuffed. We appreciated that they had a half-bottle of cava, as well.In a city with this much great food, it's a shame to waste a dinner here, in my opinion. However, if you're right nearby and hungry, it's not awful."
5314,25-05-2010 ,5.0,"We went here our last night in Barcelona - if we'd found it earlier, we might have gone more than once. The decor is very sleek and modern. The menu is a blend of traditional and more creative tapas, but they were all delicious. Waitstaff was helpful and provided an English menu. It definitely gets busy, but while we were quoted a 30-minute wait time, we were seated about 10 minutes later. Worth going!"
5315,20-05-2010 ,5.0,"I heard about this restaurant from several people and read many good reviews so decided to give it a try during my visit to Barcelona. Well I'm glad I did, the food was awesome, great selection of Tapas and very tasty. Service was excellent as well and the waitress spoke English which was a big help. I do recommend getting there a little early to avoid line ups as this place fills up quick for dinner. We got there around 8:00 and had to wait in line just to put out name in to wait in another line for a table! (I knew the food had to be good than) However you can grab a drink at the bar and wander outside while you wait. After a 2 hour wait we were seated and began to feast. Food came quick and everything was delicious! If you in the city and looking for some good food at fair prices, this place is worth a visit for sure!"
5316,15-05-2010 ,4.0,Good people watching and nice tapas. Great location.
5317,14-05-2010 ,5.0,"There's not much more to say about this place. There's an hour long wait to get in pretty much every night and you can really never go wrong with anyplace that has that kind of following. Most of the tapas regulars can be found on the menu although often they've been creatively enhanced. If I had to recommend a portion of the menu it would be any fresh seafood on the tapas del dia menu that involve the grill (plancha, brochettes, etc...)."
5318,13-05-2010 ,3.0,"We lunched at this smart and bustling tapas restaurant early, which was just as well because a queue started to form soon after we were seated. The food was attractively presented and enjoyable. The service was somewhat frantic and we got the distinct impression that they expected a fast turn over of covers. Overall an interesting and lively experience."
5319,11-05-2010 ,5.0,"My wife and I have been on a 4-city European honeymoon and I must say that of all the restaurants we've tried during this trip, this was hands down the best and where we had the most fun.First of all, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating which we have come to discover is rather rare in Europe. Compared to Italian or French waiters, the mostly Asian/Filipino waiters here were very casual and friendly, with none of the usual snooty-ness you'd come to expect from highly rated restaurants.We came in at around 1030pm on a Monday night and there was a 45 min (!) wait for a table. This was however made much easier by the waiters who gladly made space for us on their tapas bar so we could begin having tapas and drinks while we waited. Service was extremely fast and we would usually get what we ordered, drinks or tapas, within 2 minutes or less, which was nothing short of amazing given the place was packed!The tapas were nothing short of excellent -- I have tried tapas from San Sebastian and the tapas here are very much competitive to say the least. Our waiter patiently gave us suggestions on what to order and before we knew it, we had downed more than a dozen tapas and were stuffed. For drinks, we had Sangria which was well done (taste not too strong) and we also had some dessert (a bigger than usual version of creme brulee) for whatever space we had left.The biggest surprise though was the bill, for everything that we ate we expected to pay somewhere in the vicinity of 100 euros but were very pleasantly surprised our bill didn't even hit 50 euros!Overall, I wish all restaurants in Europe were like this -- excellent food, excellent service, great value in a casual and relaxing environment minus the usual European snootyness."
5320,7-05-2010 ,5.0,"had to find this place following the reviews and also a recommendation in a glossy magazine. Was easy to find and was really surprised how modern and attractive the place was. I was expecting a rustic looking place. Went at 6.30pm and found a table easily but reckon this place gets packed out in the late evenings. The menu was easy to follow. I think i ordered at least 10 tapas dishes, we also had a bottle of red wine. The food was delicious, very simple but well cooked and the produce was fresh, you could tell by the squid and cuttlefish. The bill only came to 50 euros, it was so good we went back the next day! loved it"
5321,3-05-2010 ,5.0,"Wonderful!! The service here was exceptional , especially given how busy they were. Locals and tourists alike mingled without issue, and everyone was very friendly. Portions were solid and the flavours incredible. Best tapas in Barcelona, without a doubt."
5322,2-05-2010 ,5.0,"I had read the reviews and had also been referred to Cerveceria Catalana by several private sources. Friends I was dining with had already ready had two poor Tapas experiences on this trip and were hesitant to try another. After a long day of touring they agreed to go with us to celebrate a birthday. Six of us arrived at 8pm on Saturday night to see the huge restaurant full and a sizeable group already waiting to be seated. The bar was standing room only. When we reached the front of the line, we were told we could immediately be seated if we promised to finish by 10pm. No problem. The restaurant was beautiful, much,much nicer than I expected. The wait staff was attendant with pretty good use of English. The birthday 'girl' is a 'foodie' and wanted to order several different dishes. The plates kept coming. All in all, my only comment would be to be clearer as to the quantity of each serving. The waitress implied that each serving was individual so we ordered far too much food. In the future, I would order fewer servings and add more if necessary. The tastes were amazing. We even did the Sangria, which we would never touch, but it was a party so we ordered a couple of pitchers. The prices are VERY inexpensive, particularly relative to the quantities of food. All in all for 6 adults and 8 take home boxes (another 3-4 meals), 2 pitchers of sangria and 3 bottles of water, the bill was UNDER 140E. Also, the bathrooms were clean, with no waiting. Would definitely recommend without hesitation."
5323,20-04-2010 ,5.0,"I am a VERY picky (American) eater with a lot of food allergies, but I had a great meal here and the waiter was so helpful and patient. He recommened a wonderful wine and even though we were only in town three nights, we went back here for a second meal. Wonderful!"
5324,14-04-2010 ,5.0,"Spotted this place whilst walking back to our hotel, it was packed and we were determined to try it the next night.We arrived at 8.20, early by spanish stanards but it was busy and we had a 45 minute wait for our table. This was no problem as we sat at the bar drinking wine at a very resonable 3.50 euros a glass, looking at the food and watching what other customers were ordering and deciding what to order ourselves. The service is extremely slick and efficient but you dont feel rushed or pressurised into ordering too much food. Our waiter guided us through advising how many portions to order and he was spot on. A bottle of wine and 7 tapas came to a very resonable 34 euros. Cant wait to return."
5325,12-04-2010 ,5.0,Nice and simple - i read the reviews beforehand - they are true - Modern / clean / a good quality meal at reasonable prices. What I liked was the fact that you can spend as much or as little as you like. Go for the seafood -Razor clams / Gambas / Octopus. Overall - superb tapas ranging from 3.50euros to 12euros / Wine is also good value (16+euros).
5326,12-04-2010 ,5.0,Loved this tapas restaurant - had a late lunch and stayed for hours!
5327,7-04-2010 ,3.0,"Mmmmmmm......... This is a tough one. We have been visiting this crazy place for years. We went last Tuesday to discover it had had a major makeover. The new branding was fresh and clean. It had also been extended at the rear. New tables, menus etc. But, something was missing. The organised chaos was now organised. The quirky waiters were gone to be replaced by young identi-staff. The food had moved ever so slightly towards generic. I got the distinct feeling that there were more tourists than locals. Its difficult to criticise the place and if you have never been, I am sure you will have fun. We went in search of the famous Cal Pep tapas bar but it was closed for the whole of easter week. Ended up doing lunch in Taller de tapas which served great food. Maybe try both if you have time to compare."
5328,5-04-2010 ,4.0,"My husband and I wanted to eat something small so we went to Cerveceria Catalana around 7 p.m. and a little bit later the restaurant was getting full. The waiter who took our order didn't quite understand what beer I ordered (asked if Chimay on the list was blanc; he said yes and gave me rouge instead. I didn't complain since rouge is good, too.) The other waiter who served us the rest of the evening was great! The tapas and little sandwhiches we had tasted great as well as the dessert (homemade pie). Otherwise I didn't see the place that special as it have been advertised on websites. Still, I would come back for a good tapas."
5329,4-04-2010 ,5.0,"Food was awesome. The first night we got there at 9:30 and had to wait for a table. We ate outside on the patio as the smoke was not so bad. Sat down around 10pm. All the locals were here at that time. The second night we were hungry early after touring all day and wanted to eat earlier (our flight was early the next day). We got there about 7:30 and the place was filled with more tourists than locals. Try the Bacon, Brie and Date and Pork with Blue cheese Flautas... mini baguettes they were so yummy! They have english menus with decriptions to help you order. This place is reasonably priced and the portion sizes for tapas are decent."
5330,26-03-2010 ,4.0,We went here for an early evening informal bite to eat-it is more fancy than its sister establishment Ciudad Contal but still not particularly fancy. You can get a wide range of food-all Spanish style but witha kind of modern twist.Lovely prawns on skewers and pinchos-reasonable for wine and friendly service. Would go back in a heartbeat
5331,20-03-2010 ,5.0,"go early, this place is VERY busy from 7pm til closing even on a weekdaywalk around and see what everyone else is eatingwaiters speak english and are very helpful with helping with choicesthey have english menus, but ask for one in spanish or you will miss the specials of the day."
5332,18-03-2010 ,3.0,Have had better tapas in a number of restaurants around Spain - its not bad and its not expensive but I wouldnt go out of my way to go there again. Very average.
5333,16-03-2010 ,5.0,This was a recommendation given to us before we went to Barcleona and it was an excellent one!We were told to wait in the Bar area for a seat at the Bar and that is exactly what we did. This place was packed on Saturday lunch time and we waited perhaps about twenty minutes jostling for position. When we did get our spot at the Bar the most amazing Pintxos and Tapas were waiting for us. The food is amazing - just keep ordering it - if you do not know what something is the friendly staff will help out. Chocos were awesome and the Razor Clams amazing.Just eat here - you have too!(We also went there for lunch on Monday - it was nowhere near as busy but just as good!)
5334,11-03-2010 ,4.0,I have been here a few times firstly a couple of years ago. They have extended the restaurant since then into the neighbouring property. You do have to get there early or book or queue with the locals to get a table. The food and drink is excellent but I do feel that because they have extended they have become busier and therefore the service was not as good as two years ago. It is well worth a visit though and eating here you will have a lovely meal. But try all the other local restaurants too. Although they may not look so clean and bright as Catalana (they have dropped the cevesaria) the food will be almost as good as but will certainly be more atmospheric.
5335,10-03-2010 ,5.0,"Best tapas place of our trip - ended up eating there 3 times! It was very handy for us, as it was 1 block away from our apartment.The food and service was great in here. And it was very good value. It was also a smoke free environment which was great. You could order food from the menu, or go up to the bar and pick the bits that you wanted. They had a great selection of food. It's a bustling, busy place and you do need to wait for a table, but it's worth it."
5336,8-03-2010 ,5.0,"We spent 3 nights in Barcelona at the end of February & was recommended this restaurant by the Spanish Taxi driver who took us to our Hotel. We were not disappointed! As we arrived, the place was buzzing with atmosphere - we had to wait half an hour before we were seated but this gave us opportunity to relax with some pre-dinner drinks. There was a wide selection of tapas & a good wine menu also. The food was outstanding. We had a couple of bottles of red wine, more than enough tapas for 4 of us & all for about 75 Euro's. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5337,5-03-2010 ,1.0,Be careful. We all got violently ill! Place is fun and service was good...hopefully it was an isolated incident for our group.
5338,24-02-2010 ,5.0,"This bustling restaurant turns out wonderfully tasty tapas all day long. My favorites were the sauteed mushrooms with ham (must have), clams, fried artichoke slices and pimentos. The chocolate molten cake was excellent too. The salmon sandwich was nothing special. Atmosphere in the restaurant section is comfortable and the service friendly, catering to a mix of locals and visitors alike. I will be back the next time I'm in Barcelona!"
5339,20-02-2010 ,5.0,"We liked this restaurant so much on our first visit that we returned the following night. The first thing I'll say is that it was great to be able to eat good food in a smoke-free environment. The whole restaurant in non-smoking which seems to be unusual in Barcelona. We arrived at the restaurant at around 7pm and were shown to a table straight away each night but it did seem to get very busy quite soon after 7. The atmosphere was good and there was a nice buzz in the place.We never tried tapas before and enjoyed the whole idea of ordering lots of small dishes and not quite knowing what we were going to get! The bill was very reasonable.....6 dishes, a bottle of wine and coffee came to €33 in total. Would love to be eating there tonight again!"
5340,16-02-2010 ,5.0,Have always enjoyed eating in this lively place for consistently near the best tapas in Barcelona. Be warned they are currently appear closed (15 Feb 2010) for what looks like a big refurbishment. Heard they will re-open soon but be wise to check before visiting.
5341,3-02-2010 ,5.0,"Although we only stayed for 3 nights we should have eaten here every night. Great fresh tapas of all kinds and very good prices. Plus wide selection of beers of course. It is VERY busy so if you want to find a table best to arrive early ie.7:30/8pm otherwise long waits, the first night we arrived at 9:30 and there was a line of customers waiting outside the restaurant."
5342,20-01-2010 ,4.0,"I liked this place, and repeated!!Great for tapas and recommended by locals..some tapas with seafood are amazing..."
5343,19-01-2010 ,5.0,"Food was amazing, I strongly recommend this restaurant to all!!!"
5344,6-01-2010 ,5.0,The food was fresh and amazing! This has been our faviorite on this trip! Great Sangria.. a ton of options for tapas.. long wait but worth it.. we end up eating up at the bar because the food look so good we couldnt resist. Great prices too!! Cant get better than good food and drinks for a great cost!!
5345,1-01-2010 ,5.0,"we have 3 great dinners ...fresh tapas excellent service ,,,great sangria ...we discover the clara ...beer with lemon cola refreshing...great serrano ham"
5346,31-12-2009 ,5.0,"We were here in April and managed to find some lame excuse to come back to Barcelona just to come here again. The place was better than we remembered and the variety of food on offer was great - you don't need to speak the language as most of the waiters speak English, but if all else fails, just point at a dish and it will usually be served within 5 minutes. If you are new to tapas, just order a few dishes at a time so that you can see what everyone else is eating (so you don't miss out) - avoid ordering any bread, as it often comes with some of the dishes anyway.We have always eaten inside, but there are some tables on the pavement and eating at the bar allows you to people watch big time.We are now looking for another excuse to return!"
5347,30-12-2009 ,5.0,"Thanks to you I have found this fine restaurant. Tapas and salads are excellent. Probably, one of the best places in a city. At restaurant do not smoke, and it too good news. But it is necessary to mean that there is big enough turn in the evening, it is necessary to wait to eat. If you wish to be served immediately, come to 11 a.m. or 11 p.m.And the address at you is specified inexact. Correct - MalloRca."
5348,29-12-2009 ,5.0,"This is a real gem! Excellent food and service, traditional tapas and Catalana food. Extensive wine list. Truely, a must to go and eat. The cost per person will be dependant upon how wild you go with ordering tapas."
5349,8-12-2009 ,5.0,"Cerveceria has the best tapas in the city hands down. Yes you have to be in the mood to wait a bit for a table at dinnertime (regardless of the day). But we always get a pitcher of sangria and order tapas from the bar to start.The food is great and it is always full of people. What a fun experience. Get the patatas bravas, the pineapple cheese tapa and the steak!"
5350,8-12-2009 ,5.0,We stopped in for lunch. The crowd and wait indicated that this was a popular place.After a short wait the hostess found us and cheerfully seated us.We ordered a variety of tapas. Everything was fresh and good.We went back a few days later and had another nice lunch.Certainly a great place for tapas.
5351,30-11-2009 ,4.0,"this place is a bit of an institution in barcelona and so it attracts many tourists, the fact that the majority of customers are still locals is a testament to its consistent quality. if you're with a group try to get a couple of tables outside, however, i like sitting at the tapas bar browsing the offering on show. everything looks and tastes very fresh and if you're new to tapas or to barcelona, this is a good place to start your adventure."
5352,28-11-2009 ,5.0,"I stayed at Barcelona 3 days 2 nights, the reason why I visited this restaurant b/c I read the good commands on tripadvisor. I went there 2 times during these 3 days visit, next time when I travel there will definitely go back, and will introduce my friends there. Great Tapas, some of the tapas not list on the menu, therefore better order at the bar. Near the town central, walking distance from Casa Batlo. Long line up if went there after 8:00pm."
5353,26-11-2009 ,3.0,"I visited Cerveceria Catalana with my husband, sister and brother-in-law on the first night of our stay in Barcelona. We were all STARVING, and it was very late in the evening, but we decided to go here because we wanted to make the most of our access to Spanish/Catalan dishes.We arrived and were told that there was a 40-minute wait -- at 10pm. Because we weren't familiar with the area, we ended up waiting and sitting down. Our server spoke very little English (despite the large number of American tourists there that evening), and was little help in making any selections or telling us about the dishes. I speak okay Spanish, but as he spoke Catalan, it also wasn't very helpful.We ended up having a miserable time because everyone was so hungry and tired... my advice? Plan ahead for this, and make sure you're up for getting carried away in the manic-ness of it all!"
5354,16-11-2009 ,5.0,"We found this place mentioned in two different guide books and it was close to our hotel, so we gave it a try. We came back the next day for breakfast and another dinner. Fantastic buzz, solid service, and magnificent food for a great price. Expect to wait for a table though as even on off-season week nights the place is packed."
5355,7-11-2009 ,4.0,We ate at the cerveceria catalana on our first night in Barcelona. We arrived at just after eight . Having found that the place was packed with many people waiting ;we were not to sure if we would stay but having given our names to the guy on the lecturn ( you need to do this )we waited our turn . Waiting is half the fun - we were seated earlier than we were originally told and really enjoyed the food . We went back later in our stay as as it was a Friday thought we should get there earlier . Arriving just after 7.10 we were seated straight away and after we ordered which took about 10minutes the food arrived very quickly . The menus come in English but the daily specials are in spanish so it is worth finding out what these are - most will be ones that can be worked out using some basic spanish or using a dictionrary but the waiters are very helpful and will explain or suggest options . In many ways i preferred the first visit waiting for our table was part of the fun . We were told it would be 40 minutes and got seated in 30 . If you are part of a big a party I would suggest you go early or your are prepared to wait quite some time - price wise it was cheaper than Taller de Tapas and had more atmosphere . I would certainly recomend the place
5356,7-11-2009 ,3.0,"Tapas are too pre-made....good for cheeses, cold, cuts & beer, but salads or more elaborated tapas not good. Not worth the waiting time if you ask me. The place is nice though, but even the terrace is right on one of the streets with more transit in the city so its not very relaxing to here honks & taxis woosh by every second."
5357,7-11-2009 ,3.0,"We were looking forward to having dinner at the Cerveceria Catalana after warm recommendations from friends and great reviews on TA, but having to stand in the street for over an hour to get a table somewhat spoilt the experience. The fact we had children with us obviously made things worse, had it been just the 2 of us, we might not have minded as the atmosphere was cheerful and we even got to share a bottle of wine with a charming couple from NY while waiting... This restaurant doesn't accept reservations, they take your name and call you when a table is ready inside or outside depending on your choice (it would've actually been a good idea to have our name put down on both lists). While small parties seemed to be seated fairly promptly - a couple were even shown directly to a table as soon as they turned up - I realise that finding a table for 5 wasn't an easy task, however, I couldn't help feeling frustrated when a party of 6 eventually left and an unfriendly waiter split the tables to accommodate 3 x 2 people. We had been waiting for over an hour by then with hungry and tired kids. Fortunately, the lady in charge of the inside dining room noticed and led us to a small table. The Cerveceria Catalana offers a wide selection of fresh tapas, some of which were no longer available when we finally got to order, but the ones we tasted were all good. Desserts were just average we thought.I still recommend this restaurant for its food and atmosphere, but go early and avoid taking the kids along :) Also, sit at the counter if you can as you can see the different tapas and choose more easily."
5358,3-11-2009 ,2.0,"We went to Cerveceria Catalana, because it was recommended by friends, in books and on tripadvisor.We decided to take tapas during lunchtime. We choose the selection of tapas, because you often get some of te specialties. The food was a big disappointment. It was very basic, nothing extras done with flavours, spices etc. The gamba's were just gambas, and very small. The green peppers weren't fresh. The croquettes were quite massive. The patatas bravas not crunchy.We expected much more from it, we ate at several tapas restaurants during te weekend, but this was unfortunately worst. At the others we we ate deliciously, delicate and spicy food.We had the idea that Cerveceria Catalana is the victim of its own succes. They get their customers because of their reputation, and therefore pay less attention to their food."
5359,2-11-2009 ,5.0,"Exellent seafood tapas, fresh and tasty."
5360,27-10-2009 ,5.0,"There are no reservations and you wait for a loooong time but it's definitely worth it! Great food, great wines..."
5361,26-10-2009 ,3.0,"If you get lucky to get a table, wonderful food is ensured."
5362,26-10-2009 ,4.0,"I live in Barcelona. This a a great place to eat tapas. You can use your experience as a standard then make sure you go elsewhere to compare. What you will find is some places with the exact same cuisine and 20 to 30% less in cost. And there will be some places with somewhat less of the selection and quality, and 40 to 50% less in cost."
5363,17-10-2009 ,4.0,"I can see why people recommend this place: the food is very good, the staff friendly and the atmosphere is hectic but still inviting. Would recommend to anyone! Could be a good idea too show up early (7/7.30) if you don't want to wait too long for a table, but then again: the wait can be half the excperience: watching the waiters running around with large trays of gambas (shrimps) in the o so crowded restaurant."
5364,12-10-2009 ,4.0,After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor decided to try this one out & really glad we did. It was well worth the walk. In fact we went for late lunch & liked it so much went back in the evening.The food was reasonable & the flavours were amazing! Must try are the fried green peppers & small fishes. The sangria is great too. The atmosphere is buzzing with many locals as well as tourist - which I think is always a good sign. We didn't sit at the bar stools in the evenings as we wanted a table but make the most of the wait for a table to ask the bar staff about the different Tapas available as the menu is Spanish it is easy to miss something nice. The staff are friendly & the service was good.
5365,9-10-2009 ,5.0,"Ate here twice during our short stay. The first time we sat at the bar due to the 1 hour wait when we arrived at 2015 on a Monday night. Great choice--we had great service from our smiling bartender and we could pick tapas by the best looking ones that passed by! The lamb sirloin was really good. 2nd night we met friends there before the opera and flamenco performance at the Palau, so we went at 1900 and had no wait. Service was OK but less cheerful in the dining room. Spent less than 20 euros per person both times despite eating tons of food and drinking plenty of sangria and beer."
5366,8-10-2009 ,4.0,"Cerveseria Catalana is very popular with both locals and tourists, and for good reason - excellent tapas! We arrived around 9 pm and the spot was hopping. They don't take reservations so you must wait at the bar or on the sidewalk like everyone else. But that's perfectly fine when the evening is warm, you've got a drink in hand, and you feel like you're at a happening party.Melt-in-your-mouth patatas bravas, perfect escalivada, nicely done prawn brochettes, excellent bottle of wine, and on and on. All this and more for about 60 euros for two. Highly recommended!"
5367,7-10-2009 ,5.0,This restaurant was recommended by the owner of the b&b I was staying at. The food was fantastic and so inexpensive. I would definitely recommend arriving around 8:30 because there is usually a wait of around 45 minutes. I would also recommend ordering some montaditos (small tapas) that are on display in the bar area and not listed individually on the menu. They were scrumptuous! We ate there twice while vacationing in Barcelona and do did all the other guests that I recommend this place to.
5368,4-10-2009 ,3.0,"After all of the great reviews and mentions in guide books, we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. The food is good, but not as good as many other places in town. Reasonably priced, though. I suppose that you ultimately get what you pay for. Atmosphere is crowded, noisy, lively. Service is quick, if sometimes surly. Certainly worthwhile if you are in town to see what all the hullaballo is about, but don't expect a transcendent food experience."
5369,3-10-2009 ,5.0,My wife and I ate here twice (out of 3 nights). This place is extremely busy so you'll probably end up waiting at least a half hour but its worth it. I recommend the bravura potatoes (potato cubes with mayo and hot sauce). The ham and cheese selections are also amazing. Most of the dishes are in the 3-6 euro range (although since they're tapas don't expect huge portions).
5370,1-10-2009 ,5.0,"Simply amazing! This is far away the best Tapas Restaurant in Barcelona! During our stay to Barcelona for 4 days, we went there 2 times and tried many other tapas restaurant! Competitive prices and definitely the best food! Do not reserve a table, just get there ans seat at the bar (barra), enjoy the true spirit of a Tapas restaurant and order as much as you wish! Dont miss it!"
5371,20-09-2009 ,5.0,I have been here twice during my 4 night stay...first and last night and i was impressed both times! The first experience was quite daunting with the crazy crazy traffic however the service is great once you get settled. I found myself craving the food it was so divine that i had to return for a final meal before i leave! I am a lone traveler so sitting at the bar suited me fine and it is the best view of all the delectable dishes being served! A great experience! I met some wonderful locals there too and it is reassuring to know the locals find it just as great!
5372,15-09-2009 ,5.0,"The place is always crowded but on the 2nd attempt we got a table immediately at around 4.00 pm for a late lunch. It is more traditional in style than places like Inopia but the food was very high standard and the service very efficient considering the mayhem. Very good fun, reasonably priced but not a place for quiet conversation or romance!"
5373,14-09-2009 ,5.0,We ended up having lunch standing at the bar as we were starving and it was impossible to get a chair ! But it was worth it. The quality of the food is outstanding and it is amazing how they keep the excellent quality given the crowds that eat there every day. The best is to get there just before 1pm to get a seat in the bar and a good view to all the available tapas and montaditos. Everything... delicious !
5374,11-09-2009 ,5.0,"Ate here three times in 5 days, need I say more? Great food, good service, everything was delish. This place is ALWAYS busy which I believe is a true testament."
5375,29-08-2009 ,3.0,"We came for dinner, but as the reviews before said - it was a mad house... People were eating while standing, and the line outside was long, we decided to pass and come the day after for launch. At launch time it was less crowded. We still needed to wait for 10 min to be sited. The service was slow and the waiter did not know a word in English, we had to wait 5 more min for a waiter with some control in English to come and help us. The portions of the dishes were quite big for Tapas and food was good. During all the meal it was very noisy and we had to ask for our waiter several times before he gave us attention. I would recommend it to those wanting to try Tapas with good food at low cost (relatively) and which don't mind the noise..."
5376,26-08-2009 ,5.0,"My Fiancee and i visited Cervecaria Catalana after stumbling across it whilst looking around Carrer de Mallorca, and of all the restaurants we visited whilst in Barca this was by far the most fun and enjoyable. Its not going top be to everyones taste, as we had to wait for about an hour for a table, although that was fine as we waited by the bar with the other patrons, which included a large number of locals, and had a little tapas there before being seated at about midnight and a few glasses of beer, and cava. the food here is Fantastic, especially the Prawn Brochettes, and the Veal Montaditos, all of the food is freshly prepared, and the staff are great, very friendly, and speak excelent english! Prices here are very reasonable, we paid around £60 for three beers, a bottle of cava, a bottle of wine, two bottles of water, and a lot of dishes (which included the cured meat platter), when compared to even the chain restaurants, this was cheaper and just soo much better. Unfortunately you cant book a table here, so you just need to turn up and put your name down, or sit at the bar and have some of the tapas there (if you can get a seat). be warned - this place is busy from the time the doors open untill it closes in the small hours, although more so thursday - saturday."
5377,18-08-2009 ,5.0,This place is fantastic - highly recommended. We arrived early (around 6:30) on a Sunday evening and got a table straightaway. Had yummy sangria and plate after plate of delicious food. Especially recommend the veal sirloin and the prawn borchette! Fantastic value for how much food and drink we had. Friendly service as well. Enjoy!
5378,16-08-2009 ,4.0,Visited it based on recommendations from Trip Advisor and Lonely Planet. There were four of us so had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table but you are put on a waiting list so no need to stress out looking out for people vacating tables. If you are on your own or there are two of you it looked like you could much more easily grab a seat at the bar. Great tapas and surprisingly good puds. There is also an extensive beer list. Worth planning in a stop here if you are visiting Gaudi's La Pedera or Casa Batlo.
5379,12-08-2009 ,5.0,"Took everyones advice and tried the tapas here, and it was both great and well priced (Eur28 for 6 dishes and 3 drinks) Heck! a glass of wine is only Eur1.60.The queues was quite long, but passed quite quickly is you give your name and party number, then sidle up to the bar and order a drink while you wait.Recommended folks!"
5380,9-08-2009 ,5.0,"We ate here on our first night in Barcelona, and nothing thereafter compared. The tapas are reasonably priced and so so delicious. Be warned: this place is so popular, there will be a long wait. But just sidle up to the bar and get some small tapas to pass the time. It is well worth the wait."
5381,9-08-2009 ,3.0,"another busy tapas place in the center, nice to sit at the bar. a bit touristic."
5382,6-08-2009 ,5.0,"1.Don't mind the crowd at 11pm, grab a bar chair (be fast and crafty)2.Get great tapas3.Mingle with the locals4.Frankly, do you need anything else?Great vibe!!!!!One of best tapas bars I ever seen. Cheers"
5383,2-08-2009 ,5.0,"This was definitely the best food we had in Barcelona. The place was buzzing but the food is served up quickly so you won't be waiting too long. Anyhow, relax and enjoy the wine. It's very good value and we would highly recommend it. Can't wait to go back."
5384,31-07-2009 ,5.0,"Amazing amazing tapas and service and atmosphere. We went back twice over the three nights we were in Barcelona. It gets very busy very quickly but they are happy to serve you a drink and let you sit on the pavement while you wait. I recommend having a little bit of everything over a long period of time and drinking cheap CAVA or sangria! Look out for Carlos, he'll help you out!"
5385,31-07-2009 ,5.0,"We went to cerveceria catalana last July 28,with my 2 kids and my husband. It was around 2pm but there was already a long que. Service and food was great. You can order from the menu or if you want to try other tapas from the counter just need to point and give your seat number and they will bring it in your table. The food are reasonably price, and the quality is excellent. We did enjoy our visit thanks to Cherry, Marcelo and most especially to Will ."
5386,26-07-2009 ,5.0,"Visited Cerveceria Catalana 3 times on our trip and can honestly say it was a brilliant place to eat. It's a crazy madhouse though, first two time we arrived at 7:30 and were seated immediately, the 3rd time we got there at 7:45 and had to wait 30 minutes. Food is excellent value for the quality, we had loads of tapas, a bottle of wine, beer and a shared dessert for 2 for €45. Try the mini-hamburgers, the tomato bread, calamari and the Veal Sirloin and enjoy the great atmosphere."
5387,21-07-2009 ,5.0,"Good and fresh tapas. The restaurant is very popular, so we had tot wait about an hour for a place but it was worth it. The best tapas we had in Barcelona."
5388,14-07-2009 ,5.0,"I under-estimated how popular this place would be. Me and my boyfriend decided to go on a Monday evening, and every restaurant we passed on the way looked quite empty. What a contrast when we turned up at this place - absolutely buzzing with people at the bar getting their drink and tapas orders in. Thankfully, if you are willing to wait (50mins for us when arriving at 9.30pm) there is plenty of room to grab a table in a more peaceful area at the back. While we waited, we ordered a jug of sangria (you can't be too polite here and wait your turn - its too busy so you have to grab the barman's attention when you can!) which was absolutely devine and quite potent! The tapas was really worth the wait - very tasty. We ordered loads until we couldn't eat anymore and it was still a relatively cheap night out - if including the jug of Sangria it came to under 25E each. Service was very efficient too. Would definately have to go here again on my next visit to Barcelona!"
5389,12-07-2009 ,4.0,"It's really a nice place with a tasty and reasonably priced food, which is in fact not often in Barcelona."
5390,9-07-2009 ,5.0,"On each of my two trips to Barcelona, I’ve made sure to make time for Cerveceria Catalana. The place is a complete madhouse, but the hordes around the bar are there for a reason. And besides, the crowds are what create the frenzied and energetic ambience in this place, so don’t let them scare you off. The waits aren’t quite as long as you’d expect considering the queues. Knowing how busy it can get, we arrived relatively early at 19:45 and managed to get seats at the bar. I think this is the best way to go as opposed to being seated at a table out of the way, especially if your Spanish isn’t great. For the most part, we ordered by just pointing at dishes being carried by the waiters. I thought this was the best way to get whatever looked particularly good at any moment. The staff seemed quite used to this method as well. Prices were very reasonable, around 1-3 Euros per plate. I would imagine that for 15 Euros, you'd have enough to consider it a full meal. The mini-hamburgers are a must, made perfectly rare with grilled onions.As mentioned in an earlier review, the staff can be quite brusque, but considering how busy they are, that’s to be expected. They’re still very friendly and efficient, although expect to have some orders forgotten and require repeating."
5391,8-07-2009 ,5.0,"What can I say? We happened to visit Spain quite a lot this year and tried many different tapas in different cities. Have also been to Barcelona a couple of years back but didn't know to try it then. This was by far our favorite tapas place! Luckily we read the reviews and went there early (at about 7.30pm) and got seated straight away. We got a good selection from the catalogue and the dishes of the day. They were all excellent, could not fault one of them. Sangria was great too and the service just top notch!It was so good we want to go again one of the next days!Make sure you try it!"
5392,7-07-2009 ,4.0,"My girlfriend and I spotted this place whilst browsing tripadvisor (our hotel, Granados 83, has free wired internet) and realised it was very close to our hotel so at 21:30 decided to pop out and see it. By the time we arrived it was closer to 22:00 and the place was packed and it would be impossible to fault the ambience. Unsure of exactly what to do we sidled up to the lady in manageress' attire and asked as to the policy for getting a table (we were not hopeful at this point assuming everyone had pre-booked). She promptly turned a few reams of papers and added us to a 30 party long booking list - at which point our hearts sank, only to bob back up immediately when she told us it would only be a 40 minute wait. She was right. We soon sat down, and as our Spanish is unreliable at best ordered the assorted tapas and a couple of the house beers - delicious. Spicy prawns, grilled peppers, fried fish and croquettes arrived promptly, we then went on to order some Spanish omelette, and red pepper with cheese which was also excellent. At this point we were satiated and therefore had to pass on the excellent looking desserts. Overall the staff were slightly brusque, however they were attentive and the service was very efficient, (we were foreigners speaking pigeon Spanglish). Overall a good experience. Thank you tripadvisor."
5393,6-07-2009 ,5.0,"This tapas place is great. It's just on the corner to La Rambla Catalunia. This place is never empty and busy with locals! At the entrance you have 2 bars where you can sit at. The restaurant bit indoors looks like a library, but the shelves are filled with beers they sell. The only odd thing was that they actually don't sell any Spanish beer. The food was great - authenitc, with daily specials. The price of the house wine and water is incredibly cheap - and the quality is great too. Don't get dragged into the tourist traps. There are quite a few places on Rambla Catalunia where you will find lots of locals, but this one is quite special! Enjoy!!"
5394,4-07-2009 ,5.0,"We went to this place by recommendation of a friend and we were quite pleased... Everything we ordered tasted fabulous, specially tortilla de patata should be eaten here, and we paid something regular! Sometimes you have to wait a bit to sit outside but it is okey and it is worth it"
5395,4-07-2009 ,5.0,"We were recommended to go there by a business associate who lives in Barca and I am so glad that we went. We waited for around an hour for a table which was not so bad as we were able to find a seat at the bar and were able to soak up the atmosphere and drink some sangria (good sangria at that). When we eventually ate we were not dissapointed. We had a selection of 5 or 6 dishes (ham, green peppers, small fish, calamari, steak, omelette) which were of generous proportions and all were very very good. We also had desert which was excellent. I would imagine that any dish served here is going to be good judging by the quality of the ones that we ate. We would definately eat here again."
5396,2-07-2009 ,4.0,"Went to this restaurant twice on my recent trip to Barca. It's always crowded for dinner, but the food is very fresh and is a level above other tapas bars such as Ciudad Comtal. Get the gambas rojas a la plancha or the Jamon Jagubo! They may not stand out for any one dish, but the overall quaolity is high and the price is reasonabl."
5397,28-06-2009 ,5.0,"Certainly not the cheapest tapas, but the quality was high, and servings larger than many other places - so be careful how much you order. We ended up here three times in our five days in BCN. The meats and vegetables dishes were better than the seafood we had (which is not a negative comment on the seafood, but a high compliment to the meat and veggies items). This was the ONLY place we got a made to order Spanish Tortilla - delicious. The daily specials included some less common items - wild mushrooms, asparagus - wonderful! Good wine list, reasonably priced for a nice tapas restaurant. Often crowded and noisy, but still we preferred inside to outside, esp. since they do not allow smoking inside. Service was excellent and place is just plain busy and fun. HIGHLY recommended."
5398,27-06-2009 ,5.0,Was recommended by a colleague. A regular haunt for locals and the occasional tourists. I don't eat seafood however this was not a problem. Recommend dining at the bar(s) where the action is.
5399,25-06-2009 ,4.0,"The first night we went there, absolutely no chance of a table, we went earlier the next night and had to wait 30 mins for a table. Well worth the wait, Tapas to die for! Service and atmosphere great, food unbelievable. If you get the chance to go there, take it, you won't be sorry."
5400,20-06-2009 ,5.0,Great tapas. You can pick from menu or from tapas bar. Prawns brochette were outstanding! Ate there twice b/c we had such good experience.
5401,18-06-2009 ,4.0,We had lunch here and my daughter and I simply loved it.The sauteed mushrooms & asparragus which was one of the specials of the day were fabulous.We only ate tapas and we were very satisfied.Highly recommend it
5402,25-05-2009 ,5.0,service was good and the food was even better! make sure to be hungry so that you can try all the varieties the restaurant offers
5403,18-05-2009 ,3.0,"We had read good things about this tapas restaurant at Trip Advisor and also in other guidebooks. The staff at our hotel suggested it as well. Although we managed to get in after a twenty minute wait one evening, two subsequent attempts failed. This place is hopelessly crowded with both tourists and locals.The night that we did have the opportunity to eat there, we thought that the food was very good. Quite honestly, though, we had equally good tapas, nicer house wine, and much friendlier service at other places we tried during our week stay."
5404,12-05-2009 ,4.0,"Extremely pleasant service and setting, with great food and good value as well... What more can you ask for?!"
5405,7-05-2009 ,5.0,"This place was amazing, food atmosphere, people, everything was fantastic, a must in barcelona. I ate so many great things, I couldnt even start to tell you what they were. They wer all great. I wanted to go again but time did not permit.Great prices also,Go and enjoy,"
5406,30-04-2009 ,5.0,"Waited about an hour for a table...this place is always hopping and they don't take reservations. To me that's not a big deal, because I'll wait in the states for a great restaurant all the time.Everything on the menu is fantastic. Great selection of beers (I had a great Chimay) and great sangria. The prices were great too.As for service, it's very friendly. They speak enough English and don't make you feel uncomfortable if your Spanish/Catalan is not great. And they'll make great suggestions. They definitely won't rush you even though people are out on the street waiting for tables.A fun mix of locals and visitors. An overall great experience."
5407,22-04-2009 ,5.0,we spent one evening there and it was the best atmosphere and food that we had all weekend. we were sorry not to have eaten there every night. They also do breakfast. Food wonderful and soooooo fresh. Prices are sensible and atmosphere great. This is what Barcelona is all about
5408,20-04-2009 ,4.0,"Go there early (before 8pm) otherwise you'll have to wait a long time. Really good food and you can choose a large choice of good quality Tapas. Sangria with Cava is really good too.Wanted to have ""Pulpo Galiega"" but it was over at 7.30 pm for a Special of the Day ! Shame for us. Good service."
5409,18-04-2009 ,5.0,"This is a fantastic Cerveceria!!The food is really good (you can find especially fresh fish and good vegetebles),the beer and the sangria are excellent too.The atmosphere is nice but the restaurant is very crowded(we waited more than an hour to have a table..)but it's worth waiting!"
5410,13-04-2009 ,5.0,"Our hotel recommended this tapas bar to us after just arriving late and hungry just around the corner from the Hotel Casa Fuster where we stayed. This place is amazing. My husband and I were so excited at the prospect of eating wonderful Spanish food when we arrived in Barcelona and this place is what it is all about. It s fresh, its tasty and its moderately healthy and you will not find food like it anywhere in the UK. I strongly recommend all to visit this place for lunch or dinner you will not leave disappointed. To avoid lond waits for inside tables hang around the waiter outside. They are remarkably fast and will find you a table as soon as they can. But at the end of the day I will say its just luck an incredibly busy place but well worth it. The asparagus, baby calamari, green peppers and ofcourse the hams and cheeses are wonderful. Infact its all wonderfeul we shall miss this place. Enjoy."

So if you go, go early, or go very late (open untill 1.30) because we met some girls who waited 1,5 hour for a table. We were lucky to wait at the bar and jumped on the bar stools as soon as some Spanish people left (with some help of a very friendly Spanish guy). Before you start eating, take five minutes just to observe everything that happens around you, it's crazy. I do have a lot of respect for the people who work here because believe me they work their butts off. Everybody is shouting, running etc etc. Locals and turists are mixed and it has such a lively atmosphere. The food is great and we only paid 35 euros the two of us including drinks so not expensive at all. The next night we came again and everyhting was as good as the night before. We will defintaley come back next time we visit Barcelona. Felt really welcome here."
5412,10-02-2009 ,5.0,"Over the years we've eaten here on many occasions and we've never been disappointed. I don't eat meat but there's always lots of choice. Our Spanish friends eat here regularly and they are very fussy eaters.The tapas are great but so are the montaditos especially the prawns. If you're not sure about ordering just ask for a selection of tapas and montaditos with meat, fish and vegetables. It gets busy because it's a great restaurant in a city centre and it's popular with residents as well as tourists. If you want to avoid the queues then you have to get there early."
5413,8-02-2009 ,5.0,"This place came well recommended by our guide book and hotel and certainly lived up to its reputation. We got there early (7pm) and got the last table. They have both spanish and english menus and i think we would have been a bit lost without the second. We ordered about 5 dishes (potatoes with tomato sauce and mayo, cuttlefish, clams in garlic oil, baguette style bread and spanish omelette) and all were great. The bread is a must ...... rubbed with tomato and olive oil and super crusty. If you like what is at the table next to you just point and the waiter will tell you what it is. The specials of the day are not in English so we just asked the waiter to recommend one. The Sangria was a great hit too. As we were leaving there was quite a long queue starting to form so I'd recommend an early sititng if u don't want to wait. A must for any visit to Barcelona ... we'll definitely be back!"
5414,20-11-2008 ,5.0,"We stummbled upon this tapas bar after a long day of sighseeing. We just wanted a little bite to eat, some beer, some sangria....More then we could have ever hoped for. We visited this tapas bar 3 more times before we left BCN, each time bringing a new friend with us so they could experience the delight. The tapas is so fresh, i highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch them prepare your food. It seemed to have an emphasis on seafood, so don't leave without trying the cuttlefish!! Everything was amazing...you can't go wrong here. The selection of beer is good...i mostly drank sangria here though.Don't go to Barcelona and miss this place. You'll be sad you did.As far as having to wait, as long as you are there on a weekday or during the day, you should have no problem. If you do have to wait, its worth it."
5415,14-09-2008 ,5.0,"Wow! This was the first tapas place we tried in Spain. On recommendation from our hotel, we walked here and were not disappointed. It was quite overwhelming at first. There is a patio but that closes at 12 AM (seems late but not in Barcelona time). The bar area is packed. You must put your name down for a table and try to shout your order out for drinks/tapas to the ""captains"" hovering over the bar. If you don't speak Spanish or Catalan, this may prove to be difficult. We ended up waiting for seats at the bar so we could point to items. Ask for a menu but it might not help in identifying what is what behind the glass at the bar. Order sangria for two. Point to what you want and order uno, dos or tres of each. You are charged for each piece. We liked the salmon, seafood salad, olives and fresh cheese salad. Also, opted to just make our meal out of that instead of being seated - there are different items on the regular dinner menu. 11 PM seemed to be prime time here. Definitely worth going to!"
5416,8-09-2008 ,4.0,A great experience whether you sit up at the bar and eat and drink or sit down at the rear at the tabled area. The place can be hectic and you have to usually wait your turn for a seat at the bar on on the tables but the drinks are reasonable and the food great. It is also interesting watching the staff working like mad as they shout the orders for food at the two sides of the bar to the kitchens Ate there three times on a lunchtime and once on an evening and was never dissapointed
5417,2-09-2008 ,5.0,good tapas and drinks for reasonable prices
5418,27-08-2008 ,5.0,"It's worth wait an hour to eat here. I've tried Tapas in several places around Spain, but i've never tried something like that."
5419,6-08-2008 ,4.0,"If you are looking for a good example of Tapas, decent service and a pleasent environment; Cerveceria Catalana is a great place to start.it gets very busy so turn up early."
5420,5-08-2008 ,2.0,"nice tapas, horrible deco.."
5421,30-07-2008 ,5.0,deli!
5422,22-07-2008 ,5.0,uno de los mejores en bcn pero demasiado turista.Siempre a tope
5423,8-07-2008 ,5.0,"Four of us arrived at around 20:00 on a Sunday evening and had to wait 20 minutes for a table - which wasn't a problem. Then discovered a huge beer menu, including half a dozen Belgian brews, which made the wait even better.The seating area towards the rear is very comfortable and a much better environment for the uninitiated to wade through the comprehensive menu. Swift, if not rather brusque service and excellent food. Four of us ate and drank (plenty!) for well under 100 Euro.We left around 21:30 by which time the front bar area was heaving. I hate to think how long you would wait for a table then!Highly recommended."
5424,7-07-2008 ,3.0,"""Tapas"" and beer. A place to go one day"
5425,25-06-2008 ,4.0,"Very good tapas, but have to wait a long time, especially if you go on the weekend"
5426,7-06-2008 ,5.0,"One stop shop for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great all around. Be warned that this is a very busy place, popular with both locals and tourists. If you can't get a table it's worth it to sit at the bar and watch the fresh food get cooked and served. While friendly to foreigners the place doesn't specifically cater to them, but well worth struggling through with what little Spanish you might have. Beer is house specialty but excellent wines too. Prices good by European standards for an above average eatery."

5433,12-01-2008 ,3.0,"It is definitely not a bad place: the food is good and as a place to eat tapas Cerveceria Catalana is ""ok"". However, from some reason in my opinion there is nothing too special in the restaurant. Altogether, good three points."
5434,9-01-2008 ,5.0,The best Tapas-Bar in the city.
5435,6-01-2008 ,4.0,"Next to the shops, but very different from the turist traps you find everywhere. Service is good and fast, the place is cosy and food - yummy! The best dish (tapas) was the one that had fish and cheese in a pepper. So good I need to get there again!"
